2. What are the key differences between Phase 1 and Phase 2 of CDC placements?
A. Phase 1 of placements happen in December starting with exams from mid-Sep just before DP (Durga Puja) vacations. The day1 of placements is on Dec 1 always, no matter what. In recent times, there has been an emergence of a new idea of Day 0, where students appear for interview on Nov 30th late might to Dec 1 early morning, just to increase the statsitics for Day 1 which get published in News. Since it is a matter of prestige, Phase 1 includes total number of offers from Day 0 all the way till Day 21 or so, till phase 1 companies get exhausted. Phase 2 of placements happen in January after the winter vacations and usually after Convocation of the previous passed out batch. It extends all the way till Spring Sem, till the end semester exams are completed, at times even in the summer vacations.
