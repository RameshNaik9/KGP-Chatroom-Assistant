        "content": "FORESIGHT(2021): Summer Internship at OYO |Alok Munshi\n\n--\n\nListen\n\nBrief Introduction\n\nHi, I\u2019m Alok Munshi, a final-year undergraduate pursuing a Major in the Department of Chemical Engineering and a Minor in Mathematics and Computing from the Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur. I did my internship with OYO as a Business Analyst Intern in summer 2021. I was selected for the role as a part of their on-campus recruitment program \u2018OYO HEADSTART.\u2019\n\nSelection Procedure\n\nOYO came to campus in the first week of November and was open for all the departments. Out of all the applicants, a total of 305 students got shortlisted for the online test, which had questions in the form of MCQs on aptitude, basics of Data Science and Machine Learning, probability, and statistics, and had 3 questions on SQL where we were asked to write down SQL queries based on schema diagram.\n\nBased on online test scores, they had shortlisted 36 students for the Group Discussion round. There were 4 panels, each consisting of 9 students, and the topic of the Group Discussion was general, not a technical group discussion.\n\nAfter the Group Discussion round, 16 students were shortlisted for the personal interviews. They asked a case study and a few HR questions to wrap it up in the personal interview.\n\nFinally, 8 students got the offer letter.\n\nHow to prepare for them?\n\nFamiliarize yourself with SQL query writing from tabular database formats and schema diagrams. You can refer to w3schools.com or sqlbolt.com for practice. Read about the basics of Data Science and Machine Learning concepts and practice questions on probability and statistics.\n\nYour Project Details\n\nI was assigned a multi-function project with the conversion and growth team at OYO, where I improved the average lifetime ratings of OYO on the Google Play Store and the Apple App Store. I worked on analyzing the problems, designing and implementing new rating and review strategies leading to significant growth in OYO app views, and increasing the number of ratings and reviews on stores. I got a chance to learn and use tools like Google Analytics, Hive Databases, MoEngage, Big Query, Google Play console, and a few more.\n\nHow was your experience working from home? What difficulties did you face?\n\nOverall it was a good experience. OYO implemented 4 working days a week policy for May because of the uprising in the covid cases. Although the office environment was missing, everyone in the organization was easily reachable and available whenever in need. The mentors and senior authorities were very supportive and helpful and contributed a lot to learning and implementing new things.\n\nWhat effect could Covid have on the upcoming internship process?\n\nThe campus isn\u2019t opening soon, and the upcoming internship process would be carried out in the same online manner as last year. Organizations have pretty well adapted to this online medium and the work-from-home environment, so be prepared. There will be many companies coming and recruiting, and don\u2019t lose hope if you cannot secure an offer in the initial days. There are many opportunities available off-campus as well. Keep an eye on them, and all the best!\n\nAccording to you, who should ideally apply for this internship?\n\nIf you\u2019re interested in working with a fast-paced and growing organization where you have an opportunity to own and deliver end-to-end projects, this is one of the best places available.\n\nParting advice\n\nWork on communication and soft skills and be clear with what you want to accomplish in the coming years. Don\u2019t apply for companies just to get a CDC internship."
