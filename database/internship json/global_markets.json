        "content": "FORESIGHT(2019): Summer Internship Deutsche Bank Global Markets | Aditi Kambli\n\n--\n\nListen\n\nBrief Introduction:\n\nHello everyone, I am Aditi Kambli, a Final Year Financial Engineering student from the Department of Ocean Engineering and Naval Architecture. I interned with Deutsche Bank Global Markets during summer 2019. I was working with the Rates Index Desk under FIC in DB CIB.\n\nSelection Procedure:\n\nThe selection procedure had an initial CV shortlisting and online test. Around 50 students were shortlisted by this process. After this, I had 4 rounds of interview. The first two rounds were technical where they tested my logical and quantitative skills and also grilled me on my CV. The third round waswith the senior management, where they mainly tested my confidence and my vision about my future goals. The final round was with the HR, where they again tested my soft skills and checked if I can fit well in the DB system.\n\nHow to prepare for them:\n\nOne can prepare for the quant from books like Heard on the street and 50 challenging questions in probability. Also one needs to prepare well on any finance-related project they have undertaken in the past. One must also be very thorough with their CV.\n\nYour Project Details:\n\nI mainly worked on a Credit single name momentum Index which is essentially a first of its kind investment strategy in the institution. I also worked on automation of existing strategies and implemented few tools on python which increased the efficiency of work for the desk. I worked in the rates, credit and FX domains.\n\nCompany Culture:\n\nThe flat hierarchy in DB allows the interns to not only interact with analysts and associates but also with the senior management. The culture is very accommodating and everyone is very approachable and eager to help in case of any problem.\n\nAccording to you who should ideally apply for the intern:\n\nThe best part of the selection process is that DB doesn\u2019t require a candidate to have any prior knowledge in finance. They look for excellence in anything that we have done in our past. This allows everyone an equal chance to apply for the internship.\n\nAnd what advice will you give to them:\n\nMy only advice will be to be confident and believe in what you have done until now. The most important thing is that you should be able to justify what you have done till now and you should have a valid reason of why you want to join the company and how you can prove to be an asset for them."
