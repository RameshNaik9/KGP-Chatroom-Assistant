        "content": "FORESIGHT(2024) | Internship at Texas Instruments | Sanidhya Raj\n\n--\n\nListen\n\nHello, I hope you all are doing well! I am Sanidhya Raj, a soon-to-be fourth-year undergraduate student from the Department of Mathematics. I am from Patna, Bihar, and currently reside at MMM Hall of Residence. Last year, I received an offer from Texas Instruments for an embedded software engineering role.\n\n2. How did you get into Texas Instruments? What was the selection procedure?\n\nThe process began with the submission of my CV. The initial filter was an online test consisting of MCQ questions on aptitude, C/C++ fundamentals, OOPs, operating systems, and a few on electronics/hardware.\n\nNext was the interview round, which at Texas Instruments is straightforward as it consists of only one round, unlike other companies. In the first half of the interview, I was thoroughly questioned about my CV, focusing mainly on the projects I had listed. Since the interview was conducted online, I was asked to share my screen and code in C or C++. Basic questions from data structures and algorithms were asked, covering linked lists, bitwise operators, and sorting (2-Easy and 1-Medium level). Toward the end, they asked general HR questions I had prepared in advance.\n\n3. How to prepare for them?\n\nDuring the summer break, I interned and rigorously practiced DSA problems on leetcode. For theory, I referred to Algozenith and Striver. Additionally, I spent a day or two revising probability and statistics and solved some puzzles from GFG, as these are commonly asked in interviews, though not at Texas Instruments. I appeared for 6 interviews (3-Day 1 & 3-Day 2), and questions of varying difficulty from probability & statistics and puzzles were frequently asked. Spend more time practicing problems on graph algorithms and dynamic programming since they are more often asked. Consistency is the key. Just keep on grinding, and eventually, you\u2019ll make it.\n\n4. When did you start preparing for this role and according to you what is the ideal time for aspirants to begin their preparation?\n\nI began my preparation in May 2023, when my summer vacation started. However, I recommend starting earlier to ease the pressure towards the end. Regardless of when you begin, stay calm and devise your strategy, then work consistently according to it. The last two months are crucial, so use that time wisely.\n\n5. What difficulties did you face while preparing for this Company/Profile? How did you overcome them?\n\nKeeping a consistent schedule was no easy feat, especially when fatigue set in. Balancing an internship alongside my DSA preparation added another layer of difficulty. However, I chose not to panic and focused on doing as much as possible. Having a group of friends to discuss coding problems with was incredibly helpful; it kept me consistent and motivated.\n\n6. Are there any specific requirements such as department, CGPA, or other criteria for this position? Additionally, do certain PORs or EAAs enhance one\u2019s chances of securing this internship?\n\nTexas Instruments offers several roles, but only the embedded software engineering position is open for MA, IM, and CS. The other roles are limited to ECE/EE students. There is no specific CGPA cutoff, however, a higher CGPA is given priority. There is not much focus on the PORs.\n\n7. According to you, who should ideally apply for this job?\n\nSomeone with a passion for software development and an interest in electronics and hardware should ideally aim for this role.\n\n8. What are some of the major points you think would be valid to mention in your CV while targeting this profile?\n\nTI places significant emphasis on projects, making it essential to include strong technical projects on your CV. Half of the interview revolves around discussing these projects, so be thoroughly prepared for detailed questions on each one. A high CGPA or a strong awards and achievements section would be a cherry on the cake.\n\n9. Lastly, what advice would you like to give to the students aiming to grab CDC internships this year?\n\nMake sure you\u2019re well-prepared for a thorough CV grilling. Revise linked lists, DP, graphs, and probability & statistics well since they are quite frequently asked. There may be moments when you feel like giving up, but keep hustling. Remember hard work always pays!"

        "content": "FORESIGHT(2024) | Internship at Texas Instruments | Kshitij Banerjee\n\n--\n\nListen\n\nHi, I am Kshitij Banerjee, a 3rd year undergraduate student of IIT KGP in the department of Electrical Engineering. I got an offer from Texas Instruments for an internship in the summer of 2024 from the on-campus CDC internship drive.\n\n2. How did you get into Texas Instruments? What was the selection procedure?\n\nThe selection process consisted of three stages: CV submission, an online test, and an online interview. The online test comprised four sections: Embedded software, Analog, Digital, Signal Processing, and an aptitude section. Candidates could select two profiles; I opted for Embedded and Digital. The Embedded section included fundamental C questions, while the Digital section covered topics like flip-flops and adders.\n\nDuring the one hour interview with a company manager, I faced detailed inquiries about my projects, including one involving Arduino. It is important therefore to have a sound knowledge about your projects which you have mentioned as the interviewer might delve deeper into them. Additionally, there were basic queries about C programming.\n\n3. How to prepare for them?\n\nAs electrical students cover embedded systems in the 6th semester, there weren\u2019t specific questions on this topic. However, possessing fundamental knowledge of microcontrollers, assembly language, etc., can be advantageous. For digital and analog profiles, the courses from the 3rd and 4th semesters suffice.\n\n4. When did you start preparing for this role and according to you what is the ideal time for aspirants to begin their preparation?\n\nI didn\u2019t specifically gear my preparation towards this role. I had two CVs ready, one tailored for software and the other for core profiles. Proficiency in your second-year courses will suffice for this role, and you can refresh your knowledge during the summer break.\n\n5. What difficulties did you face while preparing for this Company/Profile? How did you overcome them?\n\nDifficulty in finding suitable practice questions can be a challenge. One can refer to Gautam Saha\u2019s slides for digital topics and Himanshu Agarwal\u2019s YouTube channel for analog questions. While familiarity with Verilog can be beneficial, it\u2019s not mandatory.\n\n6. Are there any specific requirements such as department, CGPA, or other criteria for this position? Additionally, do certain PORs or EAAs enhance one\u2019s chances of securing this internship?\n\nPreference is given to candidates from circuital branches as their coursework directly correlates with the job profiles. While there isn\u2019t a strict CGPA requirement, a CGPA above 7.5 is considered satisfactory. Participation in PORs/EAAs may not heavily influence selection, but experience in relevant extracurricular activities such as robotics clubs could potentially enhance candidacy.\n\n7. According to you, who should ideally apply for this job?\n\nThe ideal candidate for this job would be someone with a genuine interest in the core aspects of the profile. Specifically, individuals with a strong foundation and extensive knowledge in areas such as semiconductors, microprocessors, and computer architecture are well-suited to apply.\n\n8. What are some of the major points you think would be valid to mention in your CV while targeting this profile?\n\nOne major point to highlight in your CV is any relevant projects you&#39;ve undertaken within domains related to the CDC internship. These projects serve as tangible evidence of your practical skills and understanding in these areas, making them highly beneficial additions to your resume.\n\nWhen elaborating on such projects, consider including details such as the problem statement, your approach or methodology, key challenges faced, and most importantly, the outcomes or results achieved.\n\n9. Lastly, what advice would you like to give to the students aiming to grab CDC internships this year?\n\nIt\u2019s easy to assume that the selection process is solely merit-based, where the most skilled candidates rise to the top. While skills are crucial, there\u2019s a layer of unpredictability that often surprises many applicants. You might witness someone less experienced landing an internship on day one while the brightest minds wait in anticipation for weeks or even longer.\n\nThis might feel discouraging, but here\u2019s the thing: the CDC selection process isn\u2019t always a perfect reflection of your abilities. Factors like timing, the specific needs of the teams, and yes, luck, can heavily influence who gets shortlisted and when.\n\nSo, my advice to you all is this: don\u2019t lose hope. It\u2019s a marathon, not a sprint. Keep putting your best foot forward, stay persistent, and trust in your abilities. Sometimes, the process might seem partial or arbitrary, but remember, it\u2019s just that \u2014 a process. Your time will come, and when it does, all the waiting and uncertainty will feel worth it."

        "content": "FORESIGHT(2024) | Internship at Google | Shelly Aggarwal\n\n--\n\nListen\n\nHello everyone, I am Shelly Aggarwal, a pre-final year undergraduate at IIT Kharagpur enrolled in its B.Tech course of Instrumentation Engineering. I am a boarder of Mother Teresa Hall of Residence. I joined Google as a Software Engineering Intern this summer.\n\n2. How did you get into Google? What was the selection procedure?\n\nI got into Google through the Career Development Centre, IIT Kharagpur. The process consisted of an online assessment (on 15th July) and two rounds of interviews (on Day 1) -\n\na. Online Assessment-The online assessment consisted of two coding questions to be solved within a 60-minute time limit. There were multiple questions (around 5), all of medium-hard difficulty, which were randomly distributed among the students.\n\nThese were the questions I got in my assessment:- Median path: We were given a tree of n nodes, each with a value. We had to find the sum of the medians of all simple paths of odd length. I don\u2019t remember the details.- Hybrid maximum: Some hybrid sequence was given. An expression was also provided, calculating the difference between the sum of maximum values and the sum of the minimum values in the sequence. We had to find the maximum value of the expression for all possible sequences.\n\nI can\u2019t recall the other questions exactly, but this might be of some help:- Maximize collection of toys- Something related to Prime Paths in a grid using BFS\n\nAim to give your best in the oa. Even if you cannot solve both questions, it is absolutely fine. There are still chances of getting a shortlist since OA is one of many criteria for getting one, specifically for Google.\n\nb. Technical Rounds:There were two technical rounds. The first round was held a day before Day 1, called the preliminary round, and the other was on Day 1 if you get through Round 1. I was asked to code in a Google Doc, not a code editor, in both rounds. So, the focus is entirely on your conceptual understanding and logic and whether you can implement it. In both rounds, I was not asked any HR questions, not even my introduction.\n\nRound 1:The interviewer asked me three questions. The last two were a bit difficult versions of the previous question. The first question was easy and was based on a tree where alternate nodes had to be painted black and white. The next question was of medium difficulty, where I was asked to paint alternate levels in black and white. I found the last question challenging and could not optimize the time complexity. I don\u2019t exactly remember the previous question, but it was based on a similar concept, where painting the tree in an optimized way made it challenging. In all three questions, time complexity analysis was asked. It lasted for around 60 minutes.\n\nRound 2:I found this round simpler than the previous one. Again, I was not asked for any introduction or HR questions, and we jumped straight to problem solving. I was asked two questions and had to optimize the solution I provided in both. Both were based on strings and the basic concept was storing the frequency of the characters in a map. This round lasted for 30\u201340 minutes.\n\n3. How to prepare for them?\n\nWhen we talk specifically about Google, you just need to be strong in DSA. They don\u2019t generally ask anything apart from DSA. I would still advise you to be thorough with your CV as the interviewer might ask questions about any point they find interesting.\n\nThe most important part is DSA; practice as many questions as you can. Once you are comfortable solving questions of a particular difficulty level, increase the difficulty level. There are a plethora of online resources and platforms where you can practice. It was pretty overwhelming when I started preparation during the summer breaks, and I felt lost. Hence, I prepared from Algozenith and also solved questions on Leetcode. Binary search, two pointers, graphs, trees, and dynamic programming are the most important topics.\n\nAs for how many questions to solve, solve as many as you can. I cannot provide an exact number. Keep solving until you are comfortable with that topic or difficulty level. Many also ask how much time to dedicate to a single question. For medium-difficulty questions, give 20 minutes to formulate an approach, and if you cannot think of one, look for a few hints or a slight idea and try again. Initially, it might take 40 minutes, but eventually, try to solve them within 30 minutes. Also, it is okay to look at the solution; what is wrong is forgetting it later. Make a note of what the approach was and what the basic concept that you missed was. Also, try to give contests on Codeforces and CodeChef regularly for upskilling yourself.\n\n4. When did you start preparing for this role and according to you what is the ideal time for aspirants to begin their preparation?\n\nI started DSA preparation in January 2023, but due to the semester examinations and assignments, I could not prepare for it properly. I started a structured preparation during the summer breaks. But that is not recommended at all since it became very stressful. Start preparing for it as early as possible. Managing acads and coding simultaneously might become challenging, but practice DSA whenever possible. Whatever I did during my semester helped me immensely in escalating my preparation during summer breaks.\n\n5. What difficulties did you face while preparing for this Company/Profile? How did you overcome them?\n\nAs I mentioned earlier, it becomes very confusing amidst so many resources, and figuring out how to proceed becomes difficult. So, I took a course to structure my preparation. Also, I contacted seniors to clarify any doubts regarding the preparation for that profile. Moreover, keeping your motivation up always during your preparation is difficult. There were times when I had self-doubt and was unsure of the outcome. But it is important to remember that you are giving your best, and whatever has to happen will happen. Just give it your best shot!\n\n6. Are there any specific requirements such as department, CGPA, or other criteria for this position? Additionally, do certain PORs or EAAs enhance one\u2019s chances of securing this internship?\n\nGoogle was open for all circuital departments. As for PORs, they don\u2019t matter at all for an SDE role at Google. However, a high CGPA significantly increases your chances of getting a shortlist. Once you are shortlisted, you are judged solely based on your coding skills. This is not only true for Google, but generally, having a good CGPA always helps.\n\n7. According to you, who should ideally apply for this job?\n\nAnyone interested in development and enjoys coding can apply for this job.\n\n8. What are some of the major points you think would be valid to mention in your CV while targeting this profile?\n\nMention previous experiences, such as internships and projects you have worked on. Good contest ratings and academic achievements can distinguish your profile. Just be thorough with whatever you mention in your CV. If you are not confident about it and it gets reflected in your interview, it significantly reduces your chances of getting an offer.\n\n9. Lastly, what advice would you like to give to the students aiming to grab CDC internships this year?\n\nJust give it your best shot :).To be honest, I believe both hard work and luck play a significant factor in your getting a shortlist for a company. You cannot control the other one, so just focus on working hard; the rest will follow. The more we focus on the end result, the more stressed we are. So, just stay motivated and ask your seniors and peers for help if you are stuck. It\u2019s all about giving your consistent effort."

However, I started competitive programming (CP) in my first year, which significantly aided my preparation. I strongly recommend starting CP as early as possible; early engagement allows ample time for practice, helping you reach a proficient level. Additionally, from my observation, those who start CP early often secure better offers during CDC internships.\n\n5) What difficulties did you face while preparing for this Company/Profile? How did you overcome them?\n\nA) Initially, I recognized my weaknesses in Dynamic Programming (DP). To overcome this, I tackled numerous DP problems on Codeforces and other websites.\n\nAdditionally, during the final three months before the CDC internship process, I sometimes felt demotivated. Fortunately, I was part of a study group of three people. Our regular discussions helped maintain our focus on our goals. This group was also instrumental in resolving doubts and bolstering my preparation.\n\n6) Are there any specific requirements such as department, CGPA, or other criteria for this position? Additionally, do certain PORs or EAAs enhance one\u2019s chances of securing this internship?\n\nA) Generally, HFTs are open only to students from circuital branches, and it\u2019s advisable to maintain a CGPA of 9 or above. However, in my experience with Graviton, CGPA did not seem to play a significant role. Additionally, holding positions of responsibility or excelling in extracurricular activities does not necessarily improve one\u2019s chances of securing an internship in HFTs.\n\n7) According to you, who should ideally apply for this job?\n\nA) Anyone with a keen interest in Computer Science fundamentals and curious about how these principles can be applied in the fast-paced world of high-frequency trading should consider applying for this job.\n\n8) What are some of the major points you think would be valid to mention in your CV while targeting this profile?\n\nA) For companies on days 1\u20132, a CV isn\u2019t usually critical. However, for HFT positions, it is beneficial to highlight your rankings in competitive programming competitions and your ratings on platforms like Codeforces and Codechef. Also, try to mention some good projects related to Computer Science in your CV.\n\n9) Lastly, what advice would you like to give to the students aiming to grab CDC internships this year?\n\nA) Try to make the best use of the three months before the CDC internship process; this can make a lot of difference. Try to remain calm during coding tests and strive to avoid errors in your implementations, as these can consume critical time needed for solving other problems. Don\u2019t be disheartened by a few poor performances in tests or interviews, as there will be a lot of opportunities. The CDC process is demanding, so remember to take care of yourself. Maintain faith and confidence in your abilities, and believe that you will secure a good offer in the end. Stay focused and resilient, even when things don\u2019t go as planned."

I am Tarun Goyal, a 5th-year undergraduate student from the Department of Chemical Engineering enrolled in its dual degree course. I got a summer internship at DRL on day 3.\n\nThe role offered was Core (Technical Training at Manufacturing and R&D sites) \u2014 This role was open to Chemical and Mechanical Engineering students. I have got the manufacturing role at Pydibhimavaram(Vizag)\n\n2. How did you get into Dr. Reddy\u2019s Laboratories? What was the selection procedure?\n\nThe selection procedure of the core profile consists of 4 rounds:\n\n\u00b7 First and foremost, there is a round of CV shortlisting. You have to submit your CV through the ERP.\n\nThey did not specify CG criteria, although most people with CG over 7 get shortlisted for the subsequent round.\n\n\u00b7 Online test (duration \u2014 1hr) \u2014 The test mainly had questions based on core Chemical Engineering (easy + average level questions), psychometric and reasoning-based questions, and a few basic questions from chemistry (biomolecule & polymers). 70 students qualified for the GD round (core profile).\n\n\u00b7 Group Discussion round \u2014 The GD round was the primary elimination round. It was technical. Every group (10 students) was given a different topic to discuss. The GD problem was about fluidized bed reactors. 30 students (+2 got extended shortlist later) qualified for the interview round (core profile).\n\n\u00b7 Interview \u2014 There were two interviews for approximately 35\u201340 minutes of technical + 5\u201310 minutes of HR interview. The interviewer asked the first question, \u201cDo you have an interest in pharma, and do you want to go for the core?\u201d then I was asked to introduce myself. I was asked situation-based questions on actual problems in pharma, and I needed to answer them using very basic chemical engineering concepts. Even someone who passed every semester can answer those questions. Most of my interview questions revolved around the humidity. Some questions that were asked -\n\n1) \u201cHow will you make a tablet from a powder?\u201d\n\n2) \u201cIf you have to coat a powder on a tablet, how will you do that?\u201d\n\n3) \u201cYou want to protect your capsule from a humid environment. How will you ensure that?\u201d\n\n4) \u201cYou have a powder in an open environment. What will affect it\u2019s flowability?\u201d\n\n5) \u201cIf you are using an air dryer in a process and the environmental conditions are not the same every day, how will you take care of the humidity of the air?\u201d\n\nand many more questions. My interview was a bit longer than others, and he was very impressed with my way of answering. He didn\u2019t want the exact terms but how you think and approach the problem.\n\nAnd according to your answer, he will drive the interview in that direction. He was very supportive and patient to hear you and shared many things during the interview. He helped me figure out the correct approach for answers to some questions. The very last question was about dry-bulb and wet-bulb temperature.\n\nThen the HR round was there, which was online. She just asked me to introduce myself, then I told her about leading the team of \u2018chem-quest\u2019, so she just asked what that contest\u2019s problem statement was.\n\nThen she asked me about my family and if I was a B-tech to dual conversion or dual from the start. What other options do I have during the Jossa counseling? Then she asked me about my preference for location wise and role wise. She hinted at the end, \u201cSee you soon at work.\u201d we hung up the call.\n\nBoth the interviewers were peaceful, jolly, calm, and mature people who tried to understand the other person.\n\nFinally, 7 students were selected for the core profile (from CH duals), 1 student (from B-tech CH), others from the Mechanical department (I guess 3\u20134)\n\n3. How to prepare for them?\n\nA) For the test round, solving 11th-12th chemistry questions (biomolecule, polymer, and chemistry in everyday life) and aptitude questions will be good enough to get through it.\n\nFor the GD round, knowledge of unit operations and other basic concepts was required. This round is one of the biggest hurdles in the entire selection procedure, as more than 50% of students are eliminated at this round. But, thinking about the problem statement in terms of whatever basic concepts you have studied can be helpful.\n\nFor the interview, They don\u2019t ask about your CV. One should be clear with the basic concepts of chemical engineering and their application in real-life problems.\n\n4. When did you start preparing for this role and according to you what is the ideal time for aspirants to begin their preparation?\n\nI started preparing a day before the online test. I think if a person is regular with classes, he/she doesn\u2019t need any further time to study. Just need to practice some basic rules of GD and give mock interviews & GD. So the ideal time for anyone targeting a core role in chemical engineering can even be a day before the online test or the day before GD.\n\n5. What difficulties did you face while preparing for this Profile? How did you overcome this problem?\n\nI never prepared anything for the profile as such in 3rd year, I started studying core, but still, my basics weren\u2019t clear. However, I knew things to some extent. Like it wasn\u2019t Greek to me. Throughout the process, I tried to use the concepts of chemical engineering from the 5th \u2014 7th semester.\n\n6. Are there any specific requirements such as department, CGPA, or other criteria for this position? Additionally, do certain PORs or EAAs enhance one\u2019s chances of securing this internship?\n\nIt\u2019s open only for 2 departments; moreover, if you are from chemical, you competition is very low here, CGPA \u2014 no criteria No other criteria other than you are interested in core or pharma. I don\u2019t think they are looking for past interns/pors or EAAs they don\u2019t even look at CVs after CV shortlisting\n\n7. According to you, who should ideally apply for this job?\n\nAnyone who is interested in core and wants to understand or evaluate the practical implications of their core domain knowledge or wants to know how the pharma industry works can apply for this profile. Aside from that, I feel that everyone with even a slight amount of curiosity should apply because the experience would be unique, and you could get motivated after working there.\n\n8. Any specific advice you want to give the junta, sitting for internships this year.\n\nI have a few pieces of advice for students who will be sitting for the internship this year-\n\nTips for CV-\n\nMake a separate CV for separate roles. I have seen people making one CV and applying in every role like you cannot apply with a data science CV in a core profile. Give time to prepare the CV for independent roles.\n\nTips for Test-\n\nNCERT \u2014 biomolecules polymers and chemistry in everyday life practice logical and reasoning questions. Time is the key try to finish as early as possible\n\nTips for GD-\n\nIf you know about the topic, do start the discussion but don\u2019t discuss everything in one go, or don\u2019t jump to later points. In GD, they give you 4 questions to discuss, and you have 5 minutes. If you start, discuss your views on 1st point, then keep quiet and let others speak. When discussing the 2nd point, only talk about the 2nd point; don\u2019t discuss any other point. 3\u20134 points in total would be sufficient. At last, you can talk about any point you would like to add. Stay attentive, or at least show yourself attentive.\n\nThings to avoid during GD-\n\ndon\u2019t start if you have no idea on the 1st question. Let others speak, and you catch up with your understanding\n\ndon\u2019t speak irrelevant talk quality, not quantity\n\ndon\u2019t just start and end at last, giving no chance to others to speak. This is teamwork, not a boring lecture,\n\ndon\u2019t repeat points,\n\ndon\u2019t cut others in between,\n\ndon\u2019t get aggressive or dominant,\n\ndon\u2019t jump over other points. Go step by step. The questions are given for a reason.\n\nTips for Interview-\n\nHave faith and confidence in you.\n\nIf you have no idea, say, \u201cI don\u2019t know\u201d or \u201cI don\u2019t remember.\u201d\n\nWhen the interviewer tells you about something, try to hear it clearly and understand it. If unclear, repeat his words by saying, \u201cJust to be sure\u2026\u201d or ask the interviewer what you haven\u2019t understood. This gives the sense you are trying to learn. Try to use this not more than twice but at least once.\n\nAsk your friends what questions were asked so that you are mentally prepared for such questions and you don\u2019t go blank suddenly.\n\nGeneral Tips \u2014 (what helped my profile to go up)\n\n1) Everyone is in a white shirt and black pants \u2014 try to have different color formals. Some will say how that matters, so everything matters. No one wants to see the same thing again & again. I was very well identified by my dress color. I was able to stand out in the crowd of black & white.\n\n2) have a smile on your face when interacting with the interviewer like I got it naturally. Everyone wants to see happy faces\n\n3) Listen carefully \u2014 during the GD, the evaluating person gave his intro (I don\u2019t remember his name). Still, I was showing so much attentiveness towards him that he started his intro while looking at everyone, but at a certain point, he only had eye contact with me. (this was the golden thing for my GD selection).\n\n4) Everyone says the CDC is just fake people with less knowledge get better opportunities, but remember, it\u2019s not just about knowledge. It\u2019s about how you present, how you show yourself. Presentation and standing out of the crowd ease your path to a large extent. Give time for proper outfit and appearance.\n\n5) Look professional. Don\u2019t take a page of CV and a copy with a loose tie, and un-buttoned collar button that looks so unprofessional. Have proper attire. The CV should be in a file with other supporting documents and have a professional diary while entering the room. Tie the collar button properly along with a proper tie. If you are unwilling to button the collar button, don\u2019t wear a tie. Have proper perfume before going for the interview. Have a trimmed or properly shaped beard.\n\n6) As you meet the interviewer, greet them with a smile. Everyone loves that.\n\n7) Be confident about what you say. DRL interviews are one of the most peaceful interviews you gonna ever have.\n\n9. What are some of the major points that would be valid to mention in your CV while targeting this profile?\n\nThey hardly see the CV or ask anything from the CV. At least in our case, they weren\u2019t grilling anyone on the CV. but having a proper specific Core CV for this would be beneficial to mention the competitions in which you participated or led the team.\n\nMention your past internships or industrial training, mention core projects and manufacturing-related projects or internships and try to relate the concepts learned in the past internships and projects to the interviewer\u2019s questions by saying, \u201cLike if I take the case from my past internship \u2026\u201d I used this when he asked me about something related to manufacturing.\n\nBEST OF LUCK!!!"

        "content": "FORESIGHT(2024) | Internship at Google | Samay Sawal\n\n--\n\nListen\n\n1. Brief introduction and description of the offered role\n\nHey Folks!\n\nMy name is Samay Sawal, I am a third-year Undergraduate student of the Department of Mathematics enrolled in its BS course of Mathematics and Computing. I am a border of Rajendra Prasad Hall of Residence. I am from Pune, Maharashtra.\n\nSome other things about me, I am the General Secretary at the International Relations Cell, and I targeted mainly software and data science roles in CDC.\n\nI joined Google this summer as a Software Engineering Intern in their Cloud Team.\n\n2. How did you get into Google? What was the selection procedure?\n\nStarting with the coding round Google had given everyone a window of around 4 to 5 hours (I cannot recall exactly) wherein you can give the test (on HackerEarth) of 1 hour during this window. The coding round had two questions - one was medium level while the other one was on the tougher side (probably tougher among all questions). I was able to solve 1 question completely and for the tougher question around ten out of the fourteen test cases. There were many sets of questions, and it was pure luck as to which set you got.\n\nSo, this time Google had changed their selection procedure, though the number of rounds remained the same (i.e. 2) but they had a screening round before day 1 on Friday itself where they took a technical round. Out of all the shortlisted candidates, some were now shortlisted for the technical round on Day 1.\n\n\u25cf In the screening round, I was asked around questions, one was a simple question based on an array, one was on the implementation of heap sort and one was based on graph traversing which I\u2019d say was a medium to hard-level question. I was able to solve all the questions and by EOD I got to know that I had been shortlisted for the Technical Round on Day 1.\n\n\u25cf On Day 1, Interviews started at 10 a.m. and I got my Interview call around 11:30 a.m. as I had other Interviews lined up as well. For this technical round, I was asked three questions all based on Graphs alongside the Time Complexity and the Memory Complexity. While the first question was pretty easy, subsequent follow-ups were a little on the tougher side. I was able to code all three problems but faced issues with the time complexity and memory complexity of the first two questions (The interviewer was kind enough to teach me a bit about TC and MC :) )\n\nI was pretty satisfied with both my technical rounds, but yet had butterflies in my stomach if I would get the role or not, and by the end of the day I got to know that I had been offered by Google for the SWE role.3. How to prepare for them?\n\nEssentially the entire selection process only involved DSA and nothing else honestly!\n\nI had followed Algozenith from the very start (around August of 2023) but did not do much during the semesters, I did DP in December and then covered Graphs in May. I covered the rest topics like Segment Tree, Binary Search, Bit Manipulation, etc, during the semester only. Other topics like Trie, Linked List, and all I covered in June. I saw that DP and Graph were important topics, especially for Google I read articles that Graph is the most common topic for questions, and thus I did Graph extensively, from At Coder, CSES, and ALgozenith Questions.\n\nI gave regular contests on CF, CC, Leetcode, and AtCoder. Alongside this, I believe the regular contests organized by GOC are very important, and not only the live contest but past year's contest as well. I also did Interview Bit but wasn't able to finish (but as recommended by my seniors Interview Bit should be done at least twice completely). Apart from this for Coding, I did not follow anything else as Algozenith was exhaustive enough.\n\nApart from DSA I also revised Probability and Statistics from my class notes and solved questions from the book \u201c50 Challenging Problems in Probability\u201d. I did Object object-oriented programming from Algozenith.\n\nFor puzzles, I only followed Brain Stellar, which helped me a lot in my Interview with Nomura for their Quants and Strats Position. I believe that the summer vacation is very important and you should plan your day accordingly so that everything is covered.\n\n4. When did you start preparing for this role and according to you what is the ideal time for aspirants to begin their preparation?\n\nIf you are planning to get a Software or Quant role, DSA is very important. I started doing DSA early but had a lot of gaps in between, so I wasn\u2019t able to have a proper grasp, maybe this might be different for you, but in my experience, I believe you should continue doing DSA without breaks (at least a little) so that you stay in touch. I will suggest starting as early as possible but even if you did not, at least cover basic topics like Sorting Algorithms, Binary Search, Graph, DP, etc.\n\n5. What difficulties did you face while preparing for this Company/Profile? How did you overcome them?\n\nThe biggest challenge for me was DSA only\u00a0:(\n\nAlthough I was doing a lot, I was not satisfied with my results in contests. I kept going and one-to-one meetings with the instructor at Algozenith boosted my morale a lot.\n\n6. Are there any specific requirements such as department, CGPA, or other criteria for this position? Additionally, do certain PORs or EAAs enhance one's chances of securing this internship?\n\nThe SWE Role of Google was open for only circuital branches, so yes Department plays a major role, coming to CGPA I believe CGPA is important, as it does play an important role in getting shortlisted for different roles in different companies, it is a major factor alongside the branch.\n\nComing to PORs, in my opinion, I don\u2019t believe it is important in SDE roles. I did not include my IR Cell POR in my SDE CV on the CDC portal. Though they can be a good filler if you have space in your CV, and the same goes with EAA.\n\n7. According to you, who should ideally apply for this job?\n\nAnyone eligible\u00a0:), if you are really into software development, you should apply for an internship role in such companies, because there is a lot to learn here and leverage the experiences of full-time employees here.\n\n8. What are some of the major points you think would be valid to mention in your CV while targeting this profile?\n\nI believe many Day 1 companies for SDE roles (exceptions like Goldman Sachs) do not really grill you on your resume or even have a glance at your resume. But for that matter, I believe some of the major points that companies look into your CV is maybe course work (at least for me during the Goldman Sachs Interview), apart from this some internships and projects that you have done should be included and skills you have gained up till now. My seniors always used to say to me, \u201cCV me white space nahi Diana cha hiya zyada\u201d. So try to fill your CV with all the self-projects or internships you have done, your achievements, etc.\n\n9. Lastly, what advice would you like to give to the students aiming to grab CDC internships this year?\n\nThe entire process might be a little overwhelming, even I was very anxious even after getting 6 shortlists on Day 1, but just hang in there, your efforts will pay off.\n\nNow especially for students aiming for SDE roles, be thorough with all the concepts of DSA, and try to solve interview bit as many times as you can alongside all the contests that GOC has conducted to date (there are very good PYQs which will help you a lot). Probability and Statistics are very important as they directly ask you questions from this subject (I was asked in Nomura and Morgan Stanley). Solve puzzles from Brain Stellar (I was asked a medium-level puzzle from Brain Stellar in my Nomura interview).\n\nAll the best!Keep faith in yourself, We all know you will do well \ud83d\ude03"

        "info": "this position demands a robust understanding of data structures, algorithms, and object-oriented programming, along with the capability to write highly optimized code.",
        "content": "FORESIGHT(2024) | Internship at Quadeye | Atishay Jain\n\n--\n\nListen\n\n1)Brief introduction and description of offered role\n\nHello everyone, I am Atishay Jain, a fourth-year UG student from the Department of Computer Science and Engineering, IIT Kharagpur. I am thrilled to share that I've successfully secured the role of Systems Intern at Quadeye. Getting this opportunity is a dream for many, and Quadeye is known for its demanding selection process and high standards, making this achievement particularly significant for me. I'd like to share insights into the selection process, the role itself, and my preparation strategy to help others aiming for similar opportunities. The Systems Intern position at Quadeye involves collaboration with software and quantitative professionals. Interns are expected to engage in both technical and business projects, gather requirements, define project scopes, present plans, and propose future project optimizations. A significant part of the job is writing highly optimized, scalable code in line with best practices.\n\n2) How did you get into Quadeye? What was the selection procedure?\n\nThe selection process at Quadeye is notably concise and selective. Only students from circuital departments such as Computer Science, Electrical Engineering, etc., with a CGPA of 9 or above, are eligible to apply. The company bypasses the traditional online assessment and opts for direct CV-based shortlisting, followed by personal interviews. This approach underscores the importance of maintaining a strong academic record and crafting an impressive CV. Additionally, the interview assesses your understanding of core concepts and your problem-solving approach. If you need insights into the exact questions asked, feel free to reach out to me via email at atishay@kgpian.iitkgp.ac.in.\n\n3) How to prepare for them?\n\nDespite Quadeye being one of my dream and target companies, my preparation wasn\u2019t specifically tailored for it. It revolved around general good practices such as masteringData Structures and Algorithms (DSA) and the principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). Interestingly, I didn't engage much in Competitive Programming (CP) since it wasn't to my liking. Instead, I focused on solving problems on platforms like LeetCode and InterviewBit and revisited core concepts in Operating Systems, Networks, and OOPs.\n\n4) When did you start preparing for this role and according to you what is the ideal time for aspirants to begin their preparation?\n\nThe ideal time to start preparing for this role is whenever you feel ready to tackle it. Being from the Computer Science Department, my preparation began from the first year of my college only. I did courses on Algorithms, Operating Systems, Networks, Software Engineering, etc, which laid the foundation of my preparation. But, the serious preparation began only during the vacations before the internship season when I solved numerous DSA problems and refreshed my understanding of the core concepts. For those outside the CS department, consider taking similar courses as electives or self-studying using online resources.\n\n5) What difficulties did you face while preparing for this Company/Profile? How did you overcome them?\n\nThe primary challenge I faced while preparing for this role was managing my time effectively, a common issue for many. Balancing the preparation with a research internship during the vacation period was particularly tough. Time management is crucial; there is no escape from this, and it's important to prioritize effectively to make room for what truly matters. Additionally, I struggled with a lack of interest in Competitive Programming (CP). Although it's often recommended by mentors and essential for many, it didn't suit my style. Despite attempting to participate in contests on platforms like CodeForces, I couldn't sustain my interest and opted instead to practice on other platforms. However, it's important to note that CP remains a vital component of preparing for tech roles, even if it wasn't the right fit for me.\n\n6) Are there any specific requirements such as department, CGPA, or other criteria for this position? Additionally, do certain PORs or EAAs enhance one's chances of securing this internship?\n\nFor the System Engineering Intern role at Quadeye, there are specific eligibility criteria that I've previously outlined. Candidates must be students from the CS, EE, ECE, or MnC departments and have a CGPA of 9 or higher. Since the selection process does not include an online assessment, it is essential that your resume highlights significant projects, internships, and achievements to ensure shortlisting. In my view, positions of responsibility (PORs) and extra-academic activities (EAA) generally hold less weight in the application unless they are exceptionally prestigious.\n\n7) According to you, who should ideally apply for this job?\n\nAs previously noted, this position demands a robust understanding of data structures, algorithms, and object-oriented programming, along with the capability to write highly optimized code. If you possess these skills and are interested in entering the high-frequency trading (HFT) sector, this role could be an excellent fit for you. In my opinion, anyone who meets the eligibility criteria should consider applying for this opportunity.\n\n8) What are some of the major points you think would be valid to mention in CV while targeting this profile?\n\nTo improve your likelihood of landing this internship, ensure your resume stands out. Maintain a high CGPA and feature projects that demonstrate your capabilities across different domains. Highlight any academic achievements you\u2019ve attained during your college career. Additionally, previous internship experiences can be a significant advantage, particularly for dual-degree students. What distinguished my application were my JEE Rank, my internship experience at the University of Alberta, and, of course, my projects.\n\n9) Lastly, what advice would you like to give to the students aiming to grab CDC internships this year?\n\nFor students targeting an internship this year, focusing on traditionally crucial areas such as Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA), Competitive Programming, and Object-Oriented Programming (OOPs) is essential. These are foundational for preparing for a software engineering role at any company. For those aiming for a Systems role like mine, a solid grasp of computer science fundamentals is imperative. If you're interested in a Quant role, a deep understanding of probability and the ability to compute quickly is critical. Similarly, a ML role requires another skill set. Securing a Systems Internship at a prestigious firm like Quadeye requires dedication, strategic preparation, and a good understanding of your strengths and interests. Remember, it's essential to not just fit into a role but find one that fits you. Aim high, prepare well, and stay true to your interests. Preparation for such roles is a marathon, not a sprint. Take small, consistent steps in your preparation and maintain a balanced approach without overwhelming yourself. Keep pushing forward, and you'll find your efforts paying off. Good luck!"

        "content": "FORESIGHT(2024) | Internship at McKinsey & Company | Samarth Singh\n\n--\n\nListen\n\n1) Brief introduction and description of the offered role\n\nI\u2019ll be interning in the role of Summer Intern Business Analyst at McKinsey & Company. Briefly, It is a role that is aligned to management consulting as its cor consulting. So there were no expectations that you should have from the program, as the work gets as dynamic as it could. Also, it is the first time McKinsey is hiring UG Interns and in general, it is going to be something that other management consulting internships there are for undergraduate students.\n\n2) How did you get into McKinsey & Co.? What was the selection procedure?\n\nThe selection procedure is considered to be very rigorous in management consulting; it was similar to other management consulting firms as well. McKinsey & Company, BCG, Bain & Co. and LEK. These were some of the management consulting companies that were hiring through the CDC. They came over here for selection through the CDC portal itself.\n\nWe applied with our CVs followed by a CV shortlisting process where they shortlisted several candidates according to the needs that they wanted to hire for the summer intern. After the CV shortlisting, there were also two buddies allotted to you from McKinsey.\n\nTwo buddies are there to help you throughout the process so that if you have any doubt regarding if this is the right role for you?; how to prepare for it; how to present yourself to have the best shot of making it. My buddies at McKinsey were very helpful. They helped me understand what McKinsey has to offer for a UG student. Secondly, they were ready to answer all of the doubts that undergraduate students will have before an interview.\n\nSo after that on the day of our interview, we had one round that was the only deciding round. It was a round where we discussed my CV first. We discussed some pointers about it; about my past experiences and then we moved on to solve a study. After that, we had a very brief conversation and then we ended the interview.\n\n3) How to prepare for them?\n\nConsulting and Management Consulting as a role is something that you cannot just build up within a day or a month. It\u2019s the whole personification of how your personality is; how inquisitive, how curious you are to a lot of things, and how you are readily able to understand and able to adapt to different situations and able to learn about different industries. As a Management Consultant, You look forward to being staffed in various industries that are there to offer along with various functional roles and various studies that will be going on in different functional parts of a study.\n\nSo you will have to have that analytical skill, aptitude, and curiosity to explore what\u2019s there to offer in-depth and bring out the best in your clients. So to prepare for the interview one standard thing that all companies have in Management Consultants is we prepare cases throughout. So for case preparation, there was something that I followed was a structure that was not very linear, but was a mix of a lot of resources. For me telling it out the resources will be in this order advising someone to start with:\n\nCase Interview cracked IIT Bombay video series. The four videos will give you a great insight into how the conversation goes and what it is about. So the videos are at an average of one hour each but they\u2019re very insightful for a starting point. Next ahead you should go through the case interview cracked book, but the chapter till drilling was something that I studied till.\n\nAfter that, I went to Victor Cheng\u2019s content, and the videos were there on YouTube for Victor Cheng\u2019s consulting preparation. They have been something that has been going on for a long time. Victor Cheng\u2019s materials give you a very good insight into what exactly consulting Industries across the globe are with its whole essence of \u201cWhat consultants are supposed to do?\u201d \u201cWhat kind of behavior is expected from a consultant?\u201d \u201cWhat do you do in consulting?\u201d and he takes you through a lot of different basics that are very necessary and after this point, one will have a good idea of what consulting is.\n\nNow you can start dwelling on checking how case interviews are. So there are two processes to it. You need to find what is adaptable and most suitable for your situation.\n\nOne process is you just read about cases in the book itself and prepare your thought process accordingly. That is what I did. I read a lot of cases about how they were being solved before reading the solution, I just used to think for myself and take myself on the journey, but not utilizing the whole 30 minutes of doing it with someone. I just wanted to cover as many cases as I could through this.\n\nThe second method is to just start by practicing cases watching a few videos of how case interviews are done people doing it with someone one-on-one and then you find a partner for yourself who is also preparing for the same and again find a partner that you also think has the same aspirations as you, as he/she and you should be putting the same amount of time so that you both progress together. So having a partner with whom you get comfortable and then he/she plans to switch profiles is something that might hurt your preparation. So have a partner that has a very strong resolution towards preparing for this role.\n\nNow compared to the first method, you watch a lot of videos before you read about the case and you watch the videos on how cases are being solved and what kind of different case studies are there to solve in this interview and then you get under preparation focusing on your presentation, on-the-spot thinking and maintaining composure and structure throughout the mock interviews. So this was the first process where you study the material first and then you get a hang of it then you practice. The second one was where you practice directly with someone and you want to go watch a case, try to do it yourself, and then you check out the solution. So these two are the starting points, I will advise you very highly to complete this process very thoroughly and as early as possible. Now, you can check out some standard books that are out there.\n\nIIM Ahmedabad casebook and SRCC casebooks; I personally liked SRCC especially because of the way they present a solution and the variety of cases there. It is very easy for one to read the book and get a grasp of what the solution is and how it is taken through a process.SRCC also mentions which year, the company asked about this case in interviews itself in the recent years only.\n\nApart from these two, you should also check out the Communique guesstimates compilation book which is something that helped me personally quite a lot to get comfortable with \u201cout of the box\u201d thinking. To be very honest the guesstimates compilation by communique was something that is a very necessary fundamental that one needs to have because in various cases, you never know what kind of guesstimate you are supposed to make or what kind of guesstimate you are supposed to skip or just make an assumption and move on, but just to have an idea about how different kinds of question could come around involving guesstimates this book is a must. Once you are done with all this material you can head towards by reaching out to your +1 batches and senior batches on their preparation and what their interview process has been and ask them to do a case with you. You will get amazing insightful inputs from your senior batches.\n\nSo there were some steps that my buddies used, and the case preparation was timed while we were practicing cases. The timer was to ensure that you are not wasting time around and you are very thorough with what you are saying how many questions you are asking and how much time you are spending on each process. So during the interview itself, once you have seen the videos you can form your structure of how you take a case question with yourself.\n\nSo this is where you note down the questions where you ask some questions on the case itself. Then you reiterate, and then you get ahead with forming them with a preliminary answer. You check with the interviewer if he or she is okay with your answer or what your track is going to be in that process and then you go ahead and then you have recommendations and suggestions with this your end of the case. But this is something that you can change, one need not follow a set structure they can always change things up that is suitable to one\u2019s personality.\n\nNext to this is to be practical at the start of your preparation and make sure you are making the Case Notes while you\u2019re solving a case during your preparation phase cleanly and thoroughly, one should not leave this aspect that they will improve that in the end. Else one develops a habit of solving cases in that way only that you will have to change once again when you are closer to your interviews.\n\nSo from the start only make very good and crisp case notes and case pointers that you\u2019re doing while on the case. And once you\u2019re done with all of this, you should check out materials from universities across the globe. I mean Top Business Schools across the world; Their case books go in a lot of depth into various concepts of Business and Consulting for example pricing cases, mergers and acquisitions, growth cases, etc. The cases are very insightful, giving you experience of various demographics. One will find it to be very intuitive and aptitude-heavy methods that are being used here that are derived from the fundamentals.\n\n4) When did you start preparing for this role and according to you what is the ideal time for aspirants to begin their preparation?\n\nI did a lot of case preparation after my second-year summer, but later I switched to a dual degree. So I was not only prepping for CDC that year but this summer also. I did not start that early personally because I knew I had a bit of preparation at the back of my hand. So I needed to just brush it up and study more and practice more but for one ideally, if they are focused and you are having aspirations then they should start as soon as possible. So that you can prepare for the interviews of other profiles while you are giving tests during the CDC internship. You will be having group discussions, and test rounds for numerous companies, so it\u2019s not suggested to leave the preparation for later.\n\nYou might be traveling, you will be busy with other different things that will be going on around you as there will be other profiles that you might be aiming for so start as early as possible. Even if you\u2019re not a consulting aspirant, having case preparation helps a lot in any kind of interview because of what it gives you. It gives you an edge in that you can structure your answers. You can structure your whole conversation and structure your whole interview in a way that is more presentable in any given scenario. Hence, Case Preparation will help you in any given scenario and profile, having a very small knowledge of how this is being done will do wonders in any different interviews that you\u2019re sitting for. The ideal time to learn this would be something around one month before the interviews, but again, it depends on how aspirational you are and how sure you are about having this. A lot of students do not get shortlisted as a large number of students apply and the shortlist is actually on the lower end of the double digits. Hence people think they\u2019ll start preparing for it once the shortlist comes out. Still, it is not a demotivating factor that you are not well prepped and your batchmates are more prepared than you. You still can cover up given the right methodology on how you are studying and how you\u2019re preparing yourself.\n\n5) What difficulties did you face while preparing for this Company/Profile? How did you overcome them?\n\nIn terms of difficulties, YES, there will be cases that you will be out of ideas, cases that are very tough to go through that might not click with you at the first instance. So this should not be demotivating for anyone who is preparing for it because you always need to be ready with an answer and come out with your best-case scenarios utilizing your toolkit properly you can produce a structure, understanding the raw data provided without having zero knowledge of the industry.\n\nBut these scenarios will give you a better chance to work on this aspect where you might be shunted upon what the industry is about and you have no idea during an interview. For me to overcome this first part, came with your general knowledge and business acumen. General knowledge and business acumen are two different things. General knowledge is about the new current updates and what policies are in motion or effect whereas business acumen will be insights into a specific industry and this could be divided into two aspects, what functional groups there are inside and what outside influences are there to an industry or a MNC.\n\nHaving insights into functional operations is important apart from that there might be industry insights across various industries. There are some trade secrets in every industry, you need not know every single trade secret, but you need to have an understanding of what industries are about. At the bottom line, you should be aware of the difference between an airplane manufacturing company and an airline company.\n\nThat is the bottom line that you should be aware of to what business acumen is out there. Some good preparation strategies to build up your business acumen are to watch YouTube case studies in general on government policies, how they are being built up, different company policies, how the company has spanned out, growth of a specific company. I would highly recommend Think School, it was something that I followed very closely. They covered business across industries and a lot of different strategies for international and national governance. They cover a lot of things, and their way of covering is very structured in a way that one would be able to adapt to this way very well.\n\n6) Are there any specific requirements such as department, CGPA, or other criteria for this position? Additionally, do certain PORs or EAAs enhance one\u2019s chances of securing this internship?\n\nYou need not have a specific department, CGPA, or exact criteria, but your CV in general and in the broader sense should be a reflection of you working to the best of your ability and utilizing your time properly throughout your college years. I\u2019ll rephrase this part once again. Your CV should convey a story that you always have been trying to do best. You have been curious throughout the years that you have spent in your college. You have always been there to try out different things and excel at them also.\n\nYou need not excel at each and everything, but you should be able to stand out because of your own experiences, what you have done, about what you have been through. From a CV one needs to understand or evaluate that if you have the aptitude or ability to adapt to such a new work environment, giving output at high efficiency.\n\nHence, these are something that are looked upon. Now transposing it to our KGP culture. Yes, positions of responsibility provide you an added exposure to manage teams, work in different teams, face scenarios, and work towards a common goal as a team. It gives you a very great exposure to honing your communication skills, presentation skills, and various other challenges that you face throughout a Position of Responsibility tenure, helping you with your aptitude and your mental solitude. But in the end, it is not necessary to have a position of responsibility.\n\nAgain, there are no such hard-bound criteria. But your CV should be a very good reflection of how you are there, trying your best, striving for the best, and achieving a lot of different things throughout your years.\n\n7) According to you, who should ideally apply for this job?\n\nThis will be very self-reflective. In brief, a student who is inquisitive, curious throughout, and ready to work long hours to make my goals come through, along with this thorough and sincere character. In brief, students who are ready to adapt, learn, and strive for the best will be ideally applicable for this job. And I believe it will be all of us as we are here in IIT Kharagpur. But in the second instance, people who want to have interest in this profile. A lot of people have an interest in tech and that is very well aligned with their interest in technology and various other tech roles that are there to offer. So it does not mean that these are different things, but it\u2019s just people\u2019s interest in different roles. And if they\u2019re aspirational for this profile, McKinsey provides you with an amazing starting point.\n\n8) Lastly, what advice would you like to give to the students aiming to grab CDC internships this year?\n\nDon\u2019t get demotivated. Keep trying throughout but it\u2019s fine if it doesn\u2019t align with your aspirations, as a person you all are much bigger than just this. CDC is not a true reflection of what KGP has to offer and it is not a reflection of you. CDC, to be very honest, can be very random at times or there could not be enough opportunities or opportunities that are made for you.\n\nOne need not worry as things in life will take time as we are all starting. We all are just undergraduates, to find our exact fit role and exact job profile that we love to work upon, takes time for everyone. So you might not find an internship or you might even find an internship, but you might not even like it. So there could be various situations. CDC is something that students do stress a lot about. But in my opinion, to be honest, They should NOT because you are graduating from a top prestigious IIT and you\u2019ll figure your life out anyhow possible and you\u2019ll be doing great. You\u2019ve already made it once, you\u2019ll make it once again. And CDC in general for internship and placement are a very small thing that you won\u2019t even recall, once you are 10 or 15 years down in your career.\n\n9) What are some of the major points you think would be valid to mention in your CV while targeting this profile?\n\nFrom my personal experience, it could be anything that you want to tell your interviewer or tell the people who are looking at your CV. For me personally, I just mentioned what I thought brought out the most impact on me, challenged me a lot, and also something that I like. So for example, in my extracurricular activities, I put down some of my hobbies including landscape photography and volunteering at various organizations. This was something that I liked and if asked about it, I could talk about it. So it need not be necessarily that you need to follow a set format. You can be yourself while you are creating and pouring yourself down on that one white paper. So make a CV that is a true reflection of yourself and bring out not just the best in you, but you in general, how you are, what you are, what you strive for and what have you done so far."

        "content": "FORESIGHT(2024) | Internship at Oracle | Aryan Kumar\n\n--\n\nListen\n\n1) Brief Introduction and description of offered role.\n\nI\u2019m Aryan Kumar, an undergraduate student in the Industrial and Systems Engineering department, pursuing a dual degree course. I sat for the CDC Internship drive and will have my internship in the Software Development role at Oracle. I\u2019m a boarder of JCB Hall.\n\n2) How did you get into Oracle? What was the selection procedure\n\nCoding Round: The first stage was a 90-min online coding test. The test comprised 2 coding questions and 20 MCQs. I would estimate the coding question complexity to be medium to hard leetcode but both are tricky and MCQs are normally based on puzzles and code snippets. I did quite well in the test \u2014100% of test cases passed for both questions and was moderately confident about expecting a shortlist.\n\nShortlisting Criteria: Shortlists were announced based on test performance. If you did all questions of the test then you might be shortlisted based on department or CGPA.Interview: Oracle comes with a total of 8 people, having 6 interviewers and 2 HR. All interview round was offline. All the round of interview was 1-1. I was the only person who had been shortlisted from the non-circuital department, that\u2019s why I had 3-technical rounds and 1-HR rounds but circuital people have only 2-technical and 1-HR rounds.Round 1: I was a bit confused at the beginning when I had to introduce myself because I felt really nervous. This was my first time having a one-on-one interview in person, which made things even harder. As a result, I had trouble speaking clearly because I was unsure of myself. Thankfully, the interviewer kindly offered me some water, which gave me a short break and helped me calm down. After that, being in the interviewer's friendly presence made me feel more comfortable.To assess my technical acumen, I was provided with a pen and a set of A4-sized sheets to transcribe the code from the '#include' statement to the 'return 0' statement within the main function. It's noteworthy that I was not allowed to utilize function snippets, a caveat unique to my circumstance as someone with a non-circuit background.During our talk, the interviewer asked me questions based on binary trees, using trees in dynamic programming, and topological sorting. They also wanted to know about my past internships. What made it interesting was that I had to figure out and write the solutions for these coding problems on paper right then and there. I'd never done that before, so it was quite tough. But as we continued talking and I got more comfortable with the interviewer, my nervousness started to fade away. It was surprising how smoothly this happened, and I found it easier to handle the challenges that came up.\n\nRound 2: This round was the same as the previous one, I had to write the coding question\u2019s answer on paper. This round was a bit tough than the previous one where all the question was standard type like finding the sum in the range of each query using segment tree, knapsack dp with binary search, and standard bitmask dp(leetcode hard problem). Writing each question\u2019s code from scratch was the only difficult part of this round. The interviewer also asked me more about my CV and my college courses. It was like they were asking me to explain what I had done before.\n\nRound 3: This round was completely harder of all. I would estimate the question complexity to span 1400\u20131600 Codeforces ratings or so, the questions were definitely of a slightly higher level than the average CDC coding interviews that season. All questions need attention.\n\n\u201cAll these three rounds had taken around 60-70 minutes each. So having patience is required.\u201d\n\nRound 4(HR): My starting question was \u201cIn my world of computer science, how can I help some non-circuital guy\u201d. I answered gently and shared my experience in three internships in web development along with what I learned from them. He seemed pleased with my response. I also mentioned that I'm good at OOPs (which stands for Object-Oriented Programming). After all the technical questions, he asked about my day and the company. We had a casual chat that lasted around 25-30 minutes.\n\n3) How to prepare for them?\n\nHere are some ideas to help you prepare for interviews at software companies on day-1 and day-2. Please follow these tips\n\n1. During your winter vacation (December), take a course called Algozenth - 201. If you're new to programming concepts like the 'printf' statement in the C language, start from scratch and build your foundation in this one month. Even if you've taken the course before, it's a good way to reinforce your skills.\n\n2. During the summer vacation, which is around 60-80 days, start working on LeetCode problems once you've completed about 40-50% of the Algozenith - 201 courses. Focus on dynamic programming and graph-related problems. Aim to solve at least 100-150 (dp + graph) LeetCode questions to become proficient.\"Before watching the DP and graph videos from Algozenith, make sure to watch the videos on YouTube by 'Strive' for both DP and graphs (highly recommended).\"\n\n3. As you complete around 20% of the Algozenith course, begin participating in the ABC contest (AtCoder Beginner Contest) held every Saturday at 5:30 PM. The first four questions are relatively easier, while the last four require more attention. If you can't solve a problem during the contest, try working on it after the contest (**very important).\n\n4. In the final weeks leading up to interviews, learn Computer Science concepts related to Object-Oriented Programming (OOPs). Watch lectures 6 to 18 of the 'C++ by Saurabh Shukla' series and practice all the OOPs questions on InterviewBit (there are about 50 multiple-choice questions). If you have time, you can also explore subjects like Operating Systems (OS), Databases (DBMS), and Networking for additional knowledge. \u201cHaving a strong grasp of CS fundamentals, especially OOPs, is crucial.\"\n\n4) What difficulties did you face while preparing for this Company/Profile? How did you overcome this problem?\n\nI didn\u2019t face many problems, but I noticed that many people started preparing late. Due to this, they were still polishing their CP skills during the tests instead of targeted interview prep which that time should ideally be reserved for. So, it\u2019s best to follow the recommended early preparation, which should be enough for people with average skills.\n\n5) According to you, who should ideally apply for this job?\n\nThe way they choose people is more focused on competitive programming(CP). If you've done it before and enjoy coding, you have an advantage.\n\n6) Any specific advice you want to give to the junta sitting for internships this year?\n\nHey CDC folks, I know the road ahead might look hard. But believe in your effort \u2013 it will pay off. If you're not from a circuit background and don't get picked by a company right away, don't get discouraged. Your hard work won't go unseen. Every day, you'll see the results of your determination. Even I didn\u2019t get any shortlisted in day-1 companies. I was quite frustrated with the way the shortlisting criteria were being used for some day-1 companies where I did 100% in tests. Oracle was the only company that I got shortlisted for day-2. So, 1 shortlist and 1 chance of an interview will be sufficient if you did hard work.\"Have faith in getting a chance, drop your \u201cbt\u201d for sure.\"\n\n7) Kindly attach your resume. What are some of the major points you think would be valid to mention in your CV while targeting this profile? (any specific suggestions you would like to make?)\n\nList all your internships, projects, and achievements clearly in bold on your CV. Be ready to talk about them confidently and warmly. CV discussions are important to understand your past experiences, so make sure you can confidently explain and impress the interviewer with what you've done."

        "content": "FORESIGHT(2024) | Internship at EXL Services | Pravalika Das\n\n--\n\nListen\n\n1) Brief introduction and description of the offered role.\n\nHi. My name is Pravalika Das. I am a fourth-year undergraduate student of the Department of Chemical Engineering enrolled in its B.Tech course. I was offered a Summer Internship at EXL Services in the last year\u2019s on-campus internship season.\n\nMy main role is that of a Data Analyst and to assist in any project as per the requirements.\n\n2) How did you get into EXL? What was the selection procedure?\n\nIt was an interesting experience. I was shortlisted for the interview rounds while I was in my Inter-IIT last year. Fortunately, everything went well and I received a call from the Placecoms that I had received the offer.\n\nThe selection procedure consisted of a Resume shortlisting round followed by 2 Personal Interviews. Both the interviewers asked stuff related to my projects, Probability and Statistics, Aptitude(Logic) questions as well as Guesstimates.\n\nI remember my Guesstimate question from the second interviewer to be:\n\nWhat percent of KGP Junta indulge in Coffee?\n\n3) How to prepare for them?\n\nThe list of the shortlisted candidates was released a day before the interview round. In such a short period, it becomes difficult to actually \u201cprepare\u201d, rather it would be advisable to revise the resume that has been submitted and the topics that have been mentioned in the CV.\n\nIt would be good if the shortlisted candidate knew the basics of Guesstimates(the different approaches and the preliminary questions that need to be asked). The interviewer mainly looks at our thought process in this. Knowing a bit about the company also helps! I remember talking to my interviewers about the company in the end and the insights they provided to the questions I asked were great. It is good to show that you have an interest in the company and are curious about it. Going through HR questions like \u201cWhy Data Analyst role?, Why EXL?\u201d is also important.\n\n4) When did you start preparing for this role and according to you what is the ideal time for aspirants to begin their preparation?\n\nData was my backup option in case I did not get an Intern in my preferred domain. I had done projects in Data Science till the summer of last year, so I included the ones I was sure I could answer all the questions fearlessly. I had explored this field back in the summers of 1st year and I brushed up my concepts in the last year\u2019s summer vacations.\n\nThe ideal time to start the preparation would definitely be the summer vacation if someone hasn\u2019t started yet. EXL comes around the end of September/beginning of October, so a person has sufficient time to skill themselves up.\n\n5) What difficulties did you face while preparing for this Company/Profile? How did you overcome them?\n\nI was not good at coding during the last summers. I had done some CP stuff in the summers but had stopped midway when I was too demotivated. The biggest hindrance to this role was the coding rounds that had to be passed.\n\nLuckily, EXL had no such coding rounds so I was shortlisted based on my knowledge of Data ;)\n\nBut yes, if one is going for this role, knowing DSA is pivotal! It\u2019s great if a person doesn\u2019t stop coding if they are not getting the desired results at once.\n\n6) Are there any specific requirements such as department, CGPA, or other criteria for this position? Additionally, do certain PORs or EAAs enhance one\u2019s chances of securing this internship?\n\nNo. EXL did not have any such criteria that only the Circuital Department students would be allowed to submit their resumes etc. There weren\u2019t any CGPA criteria as well. People having less than 7.5 CG were also shortlisted as far as I can remember.\n\nPoRs and EAAs are good to have in your resume but they do not make quite an impact in the selection procedure.\n\n7) According to you, who should ideally apply for this job?\n\nAnyone who has a fascination with Data Science/Analysis should apply for this role or those who have kept Data as their backup option. It is good to have at least 2\u20133 projects if one has decided to apply for this role.\n\n8) Kindly attach your CV/Resume. What are some of the major points you think would be valid to mention in your CV while targeting this profile?\n\nProjects! Projects! Projects!\n\nThe only thing that matters is the Project/ Previous Internship in this field. It doesn\u2019t mean one shouldn\u2019t have any other sections in their CV but the CV should contain a minimum of 2 projects/interns that the person can defend in the interview if shortlisted. Adding NLP projects would be beneficial since the role explicitly mentioned that we needed to do some NLP stuff.\n\n9) Lastly, what advice would you like to give to the students aiming to grab CDC internships this year?\n\nI got shortlisted by 4 companies in Day 1 and 3 but couldn\u2019t convert them because of my nerves in the interviews, whereas in EXL, even though I was in IIT Gandhinagar and had to run after the inauguration ceremony to my hostel to start the interview, I was quite calm(maybe due to the joyous mood of everyone near me). I did not stress at all and answered all the questions that were asked. So, the best lesson I learned was to maintain your calm :) and would advise the same to the CDC junta. Consider the interviewer to be a common person asking you questions in the area of your expertise and go for it!! Best of Luck CDC Junta."

        "content": "FORESIGHT(2024) | Internship at Mastercard | Khushi Agrawal |\n\n--\n\nListen\n\n1) Brief introduction and description of offered role.\n\nHey, you all! I am Khushi Agrawal, a pre-final year undergraduate student from the Department of Electrical Engineering, enrolled in the B.Tech course for Instrumentation Engineering. I am a resident of Sister Nivedita Hall of Residence and hail from Bhilai, Chhattisgarh. I received an offer from Mastercard on Day \u2014 3 of the CDC internship drive for a Software Development Engineering role, and I will be working with the Tech (Payments and Networks) team this summer.\n\n2) How did you get into Mastercard? What was the selection procedure?\n\nFirstly, we had an Online Assessment round of 60 mins at Nalanda. It consisted of two easy-level coding questions. Despite their simplicity, they included some critical test cases. I managed to solve one question completely, but I recall one test case not passing in the other question. Nevertheless, I qualified for the interview round scheduled for Day 3.\n\nThere were two interview rounds, both conducted online via one-on-one video calls, but we had to go to Nalanda for the interviews.\n\nIn the first round, the interviewer asked me to introduce myself and provide a quick overview of the projects listed on my resume. This was followed by 2\u20133 questions about my research internship and the SWG website development I had mentioned. Then came some behavioral questions such as: Why Instrumentation Engineering? What are your future academic-related plans? What is one thing you wish you could have contributed to as a tech-savvy individual but couldn\u2019t? The interviewer was quite calm throughout the process and didn\u2019t ask overly challenging questions. Thus, the first round concluded smoothly.\n\nI was asked to wait for 10 minutes before being directed to join another meet link for the second round. I began with my introduction again. Then, the interviewer asked me a few CV-related questions, to which I responded to the best of my ability. After that, he presented a problem statement: there are emails of four categories arriving randomly in the inbox, and you need to classify them according to their category. How would you approach this? Initially, I answered using a data structure logic, thinking it was a DSA question. However, it turned out to be an ML-related question, so my response wasn\u2019t very apt. He then moved on to ask the difference between Red-Black trees and Binary trees in data structures and concluded by asking what I know about Mastercard. The second round was completed, and after a few minutes, I was informed that I had been selected.\n\n3) How to prepare for them?\n\nPreparation for SDE role follows a focused and a one-way path: becoming well-versed in Data Structures and practicing questions consistently. I purchased a self-paced DSA course from GeeksforGeeks, which covered all data structures in a systematic and easy-to-understand manner, greatly aiding my theoretical understanding. Additionally, there are various YouTube channels like Luv Babbar and Take U Forward that provide detailed explanations, which were quite helpful.\n\nFor practice, platforms such as LeetCode, AtCoder, InterviewBit, and the CSES Problem Set are invaluable. In particular, I find Codeforces to be the best platform for competitive programming, as it trains the brain to solve complex problems quickly, which ultimately helps during the Online Assessments. I primarily used InterviewBit for its curated questions that can be completed in a short time, covering almost all types of problems.\n\n4) When did you start preparing for this role and according to you what is the ideal time for aspirants to begin their preparation?\n\nI started preparing for this role in my second year. However, it was challenging to balance coding with the course curriculum and other commitments on a regular basis. As a result, the bulk of my preparation occurred in the last three months. These three months were crucial, affording ample time to focus solely on key aspects of the selected profile.\n\n5) What difficulties did you face while preparing for this Company/Profile? How did you overcome them?\n\nStaying on track with regular problem-solving was the biggest challenge in my preparation. I, along with my friend, created a basic schedule to cover all the important topics. Discussing challenges with others made it more interesting and kept us going. With so many applicants, it\u2019s tough to stand out and get picked for interviews, but at the end of the day, patience is the key to everything! :)\n\n6) Are there any specific requirements such as department, CGPA, or other criteria for this position? Additionally, do certain PORs or EAAs enhance one\u2019s chances of securing this internship?\n\nMastercard hired for two roles: SDE and Product Development Intern. The SDE role was open to students from circuital branches only, with no CGPA criteria, while the Product Development role was available to students from circuital + Mechanical peeps, with a CGPA requirement of 7.5. Although some companies do not specify a CGPA criterion, maintaining a decent CGPA significantly adds to the points and truly helps in the shortlisting process.\n\nWhile companies generally do not pay much emphasis on PORs and EAAs for this role, including them on your CV makes it look more substantial and noticeable.\n\n7) According to you, who should ideally apply for this job?\n\nAnyone who is interested in coding and enjoys digging deep into the technical aspects of anything can apply for this role. The majority of companies hire in this domain because of its demand and necessity, so it increases the chances of grabbing an opportunity at any recognized firm to a greater extent.\n\n8) What are some of the major points you think would be valid to mention in CV while targeting this profile?\n\nCVs usually go through the ATS machine, which helps with the shortlisting process. Some key points to keep in mind while you prepare your CVs are:\n\na) Present projects and internships concisely in 2\u20133 bullets, focusing more on numbers to increase the credibility of your accomplishments.\n\nb) Maintain a clean and well-structured format by keeping each point to a single line, spanning from left to right.\n\nc) Mention self-initiated or tech-related projects that are relevant for an SDE role, highlighting the tech stack utilized in projects.\n\nd) If you have a considerable rank in coding platforms, then it is worth mentioning.\n\ne) Avoid making spelling and grammatical mistakes since it lowers down the impression.\n\nA particular dedicated time is given for CV preparation, so one must seek feedback from seniors to ensure an up-to-the-mark presentation. Also, avoid mentioning those things which you are unaware of or are unsure of, as this can pose a problem during the interview process.\n\n9) Lastly, what advice would you like to give to the students aiming to grab CDC internships this year?\n\nThe CDC process can be overwhelming. It\u2019s not just about preparation but also about staying positive and confident till the time situation is in our favour. Rejections and seeing peers land internships early can bring self-doubts, but remember, good things take time. Keeping up the effort and having a resilient attitude, clubbed with support from friends and family, helps overcome challenges and breakdowns. And hey, there are plenty of opportunities out there, so don\u2019t be afraid to explore different paths. Just give it your best shot, and you\u2019ll find the right fit eventually. Keep your head up, and keep going!\n\nResults are generally not in our control, but persistence and a never-give-up attitude matter most in the long run. Wishing all the very best to everyone!"

Then, dive into solving cases from reputable sources like the IIM -A and IIM -B casebooks, and utilize resources like Case Interview Cracked for partnered practice with peers serving as case prep partners. Additionally, exploring casebooks such as the Wharton Case Book and SRCC Case Compendium can offer further exposure to a variety of cases.\n\n4) When did you start preparing for this role and according to you what is the ideal time for aspirants to begin their preparation?\n\nA) I believe candidates participating in the CDC Internship Session shouldn\u2019t limit themselves to just consulting roles. It\u2019s crucial to diversify options. Therefore, alongside preparing for other profiles, it\u2019s wise to allocate a dedicated 1\u20132 hour slot daily for case preparation. Typically, dedicating around 1\u20131.5 months to case prep allows for a solid grasp of various case types and structuring methods. Consistent practice with peers is key, establishing a feedback loop to ensure incorporation of key takeaways from each case.\n\n5) What difficulties did you face while preparing to be a Consult at Boston Consulting Group? How did you overcome them?\n\nA) The major roadblock that the students applying for consulting roles face is the uncertainty revolving around the shortlisting process. I would recommend all the students applying for this role have faith and believe in their capabilities. A strong case prep can greatly improve your chances of securing internships in various other profiles and companies too. So, keep the prep good, help your friends, and don\u2019t put all your eggs in one basket. Consulting shortlists can get random at one point. So, prepare well for other profiles as well.\n\n6) Are there any specific requirements such as department, CGPA, or other criteria for this position? Additionally, do certain PORs or EAAs enhance one\u2019s chances of securing this internship?\n\nA) A well-rounded profile across all the sections significantly enhances the likelihood of receiving a shortlist. Moreover, an exceptionally high CGPA boosts your chances of being shortlisted in many profiles. So start attending classes and study well for your exams\n\n7) According to you, who should ideally apply for this job?\n\nA) Consulting attracts individuals who love real problem-solving through strategies and excel in managing multiple stakeholders simultaneously. Moreover, it appeals to those who are prepared to commit to long hours and seek a well-defined professional advancement ladder.\n\n8) Lastly, what advice would you like to give to the students aiming to grab CDC internships this year?\n\nA) An important suggestion from my end to all my fellow juniors apart from the existing generic fundae in different profiles, is \u2018Always talk to KGP Alumni.\u2019 They have gone through the same process before, they are well-versed with the different tricks and processes required to grab internships and placements in your so-called dream companies. I have seen many students engaging with alumni primarily to secure internships or jobs. However, it\u2019s important to recognize that alumni often genuinely enjoy assisting their juniors in need. Therefore, don\u2019t overlook the opportunity of grabbing such a valuable asset."

        "content": "--\n\nListen\n\n1) Brief introduction and description of offered role\n\nHello everyone, I\u2019m Lakshya Jindal Gupta, a fourth-year economics student. I recently accepted a position in BlackRock\u2019s Core Analytics Solution group, previously known as the Portfolio Analytics group. This group is divided into two teams: Single Securities and Portfolio Risk. The Single Securities team focuses on analytics at the security level, generating key metrics that the Portfolio Risk team uses to estimate risk and perform analytics at the portfolio level. I am part of the Portfolio Risk team, and my project involves backtesting the Enhanced Historical VaR (Value at Risk). My role is to assess the validity of the HVAR model currently used by the firm through various statistical techniques and assist in the firm-wide transition from one infrastructure to another.\n\n2)How did you get into BlackRock? What was the selection procedure?\n\nBlackRock\u2019s selection process for this role involved an initial CV shortlisting, specifically targeting dual-degree students. Holding a CFA or FRM certification was a significant advantage in securing a shortlist spot. The interview process consisted of three rounds: two technical and one HR round. In the technical rounds, I was primarily asked questions related to economics and finance, reflecting my academic background and the CFA on my CV. Other candidates also faced questions on puzzles, mathematics, and machine learning. The final round focused on HR questions, with a strong emphasis on understanding the candidate\u2019s motivations for wanting to join BlackRock (this is a question almost every candidate should expect) and discussing personal weaknesses.\n\n3) How to prepare for them?\n\nHolding a CFA or FRM certification can be advantageous. Additionally, candidates should have a strong foundation in basic bond valuations, macroeconomics, and an understanding of derivatives. Familiarity with recent macroeconomic events or actively managing your own investment portfolio can also be beneficial. These topics not only serve as excellent discussion points during the interview but can also help steer the conversation towards areas where you are most comfortable and knowledgeable.\n\n4) When did you start preparing for this role and according to you what is the ideal time for aspirants to begin their preparation?\n\nFor this role, I didn\u2019t prepare anything specific outside of my usual studies. Instead, I focused on revising the core topics covered in the CFA curriculum. I recommend that candidates stay updated with the latest finance-related news. Additionally, having experience from a finance-related internship can provide a significant advantage in the selection process.\n\n6) Are there any specific requirements such as department, CGPA, or other criteria for this position? Additionally, do certain PORs or EAAs enhance one\u2019s chances of securing this internship?\n\nBlackRock was open to candidates from all departments, provided they were enrolled in dual degree programs. While there was no strict CGPA requirement, maintaining a score above 8\n\nwas considered a plus. Positions of Responsibility (PORs) or Extracurricular Activity Achievements (EAA) were not mandatory, but having these can be beneficial. They not only help in driving the direction of the interviews but also enhance a candidate\u2019s chances of selection.\n\n7) According to you, who should ideally apply for this job?\n\nEveryone is encouraged to apply for roles at BlackRock. The company offers a variety of tech-specific projects, so even if you don\u2019t have a background in finance but possess strong coding skills, you are definitely a viable candidate for these positions.\n\n8) What are some of the major points you think would be valid to mention in CV while targeting this profile?\n\nSecuring a position at BlackRock can be significantly enhanced by having finance-related internships or certifications such as CFA or FRM. Additionally, notable achievements such as winning competitions can serve as important highlights on your resume. If you have undertaken machine learning courses or completed relevant internships, mentioning these is crucial as they can greatly increase your chances of being shortlisted.\n\n9)Lastly, what advice would you like to give to the students aiming to grab CDC internships this year?\n\nStay calm and talk with seniors if you face any issues. Keep yourself updated and regularly check all the notifications released on the notice board. I have seen many of my peers miss deadlines to apply for companies where they had a good chance of getting a shortlist, so please try to avoid that. Getting stressed during this phase is very normal, keep in regular touch with your parents and loved ones."

        "info": "When it comes to preparing for consulting interviews, one of the most important steps is to begin by crafting a strong CV. Ensure it showcases a balanced profile, emphasizing your academic accomplishments, previous internships, positions of responsibility (PORs), and involvement in extracurricular activities.",
        "content": "--\n\n1\n\nListen\n\n1) Brief introduction and description of the offered role\n\nHello, Abhyank this side. I am a 4th-year student of the Department of Geology and Geophysics and a boarder of Pt. Madan Mohan Malaviya Hall of Residence. I\u2019ll be joining L.E.K. Consulting as part of their Summer Associate Program. With the program, interns are expected to get a thorough experience similar to that of a full-time associate at the company. Getting them to understand the know-how of consulting is their primary objective. Interns work with case teams and participate extensively in real-time client interactions while getting mentored by seasoned consultants.\n\n2) How did you get into L. E. K. Consulting? What was the selection procedure?\n\nOn Day 1, we encountered an intense but rather exhilarating selection process. It commenced with a senior consultant presenting me with a case study centered around a prominent healthcare entity. Subsequently, I faced a guesstimate round, where I was tasked to estimate the number of Ferris Wheels in the US. These initial rounds were followed by a Partner Round and an HR round, each contributing to the overall evaluation process. The last two rounds were mainly about my resume and past experiences evaluating a cultural fit with the company.\n\n3) How to prepare for them?\n\nWhen it comes to preparing for consulting interviews, one of the most important steps is to begin by crafting a strong CV. Ensure it showcases a balanced profile, emphasizing your academic accomplishments, previous internships, positions of responsibility (PORs), and involvement in extracurricular activities. Reviewing shortlisted resumes from seniors can provide valuable insights into the expectations and standards.\n\nExplore some resources that will help you become more familiar with guesstimates and case interviews. There are some great YouTube channels out there that offer excellent tutorials. Victor Cheng, Aaditya Agarwal, and IIT Bombay CIC are just a few examples of channels that provide valuable guidance. Gain a deep understanding of frameworks, specifically those related to profitability and market entry, and participate in collaborative practice sessions with a small group of 3\u20134 peers.\n\nImplement your learnings by practicing with useful sources such as Day One, Case Interviews Cracked, Case Compendium, and other Case Books from the likes of IIM A/B/C. Utilize the opportunity to participate in several practice rounds with seniors and assigned buddies who can provide their expertise to help you refine your approach.\n\nWhen starting, it\u2019s immensely crucial to focus on structuring your thoughts rather than solely aiming for the correct solution. Select a range of case studies from different industries and employ a MECE (mutually exclusive, collectively exhaustive) strategy when developing your solutions. Strive for constant improvement after each case, prioritizing the quality of your cases rather than the quantity.\n\n4) When did you start preparing for this role and according to you what is the ideal time for aspirants to begin their preparation?\n\nI started my preparation with a slight delay but was fortunate enough to receive guidance from seniors to compensate for the lost time. I recommend everyone to initiate their preparation by focusing on crafting their CVs initially. This process calls for thorough attention and a significant time commitment.\n\nIdeally, aspiring candidates can kickstart their case prep around June, allowing ample time to gradually ramp up the intensity of these sessions. Starting early provides the advantage of structuring your preparation meticulously and also mitigating the likelihood of last-minute hurdles or rushed efforts.\n\n5) What difficulties did you face while preparing to be at L. E. K. Consulting? How did you overcome them?\n\nParticularly, navigating the compressed timeline between shortlists, buddy rounds, and the actual interviews can be a challenge for many. However, maintaining a robust preparation regimen beforehand was instrumental in overcoming the same. By dedicating sufficient time well before and familiarizing oneself with case interview frameworks, you can be better equipped to navigate the demanding schedule.\n\nStaying connected with seniors emerged as a crucial strategy for managing the anxiety posed during these days. Their first-hand experiences and insights proved invaluable in offering guidance and support throughout the period. Their advice not only helped me stay focused but also provided reassurance during moments of doubt.\n\n6) Are there any specific requirements such as department, CGPA, or other criteria for this position? Additionally, do certain PORs or EAAs enhance one\u2019s chances of securing this internship?\n\nWhile there are no specific departmental requirements, maintaining a decent CGPA certainly enhances your chances of securing a shortlist. Although there are no hard cutoffs, a higher CGPA is generally advantageous.\n\nHighlighting your involvement with positions of responsibility (PORs) can greatly strengthen your candidature. It showcases your accountability and leadership skills, which are highly valued in the consulting role. Similarly, participation in extracurricular academic activities (EAAs) reflects a well-rounded profile and a genuine interest in fields beyond academics.\n\nMoreover, past internships, especially those relevant to consulting or demonstrating analytical and problem-solving abilities, can further help your application.\n\n7) According to you, who should ideally apply for this job?\n\nConsulting presents an intriguing opportunity for individuals with a natural aptitude for problem-solving and structured thinking. If you are someone who has a knack for solving complex challenges and thrives in fast-paced environments, you can give consulting a try.\n\nIt\u2019ll offer you the opportunity to work across a wide range of sectors and collaborate with the best minds to solve complex business and strategy cases. The dynamic and challenging nature of the work creates a unique opportunity for rapid learning and helps you drive meaningful impact around real-world problems.\n\n8) Kindly attach your CV/Resume. What are some of the major points you think would be valid to mention in your CV while targeting this profile?\n\nOne valuable piece of advice I received from a senior was to review numerous CVs while staying true to your strengths. If you believe that your academic achievements are your greatest strength, don\u2019t hesitate to showcase them proudly. The same principle applies to internships, PORs, or EAAs. Highlight your unique skills as companies seek individuals with diverse backgrounds and distinctive abilities.\n\n9) Lastly, what advice would you like to give to the students aiming to grab CDC internships this year?\n\nFirst and foremost, it\u2019s important to maintain perspective throughout the process. While securing an internship is undeniably crucial, it\u2019s important to keep in mind that not obtaining one in no way defines your capabilities. Understanding this perspective can help alleviate unnecessary pressure and allow you to approach the process with a more balanced mindset.\n\nThe internship application process can be mentally taxing, so don\u2019t hesitate to reach out to your peers and seniors for support. Engage in open and honest conversations, share experiences, and lean on each other for guidance and encouragement. Remember, we\u2019re all in this together, and supporting one another creates a healthy environment for growth and success as a community.\n\nYou need to stay resilient and focus on growth over this period. Regardless of the outcome, view the internship application process as a valuable learning experience. Take the opportunity to reflect on your strengths and areas for development, and use this insight to refine your skills and strategies for future opportunities."

This summer I will be interning at Sprinklr as a Product Engineer.\n\n2) How did you get into Sprinklr? What was the selection procedure?\n\nA) The selection process consisted of one online coding round and 3 rounds of interviews. In the coding round, we were given 90 minutes to solve 3 questions. The questions were based on binary search, dynamic programming optimization, and basic implementation. The questions were a mix of easy, medium, and difficult problems.\n\nIn the first technical round, the interviewer started by asking a classical DP question ( Count the no.of the subset with a given sum in an array ). I was asked to write the code on Google Docs and not on any code editor. As I had done a project on ML and the interviewer was also from an ML background, so he asked me some basic questions related to ML and related to my project and also asked me to code it. This interview lasted for about 40 min.\n\nIn the second technical interview, the interviewer asked me to give a 5-minute introduction about myself. After that, I was asked to code a telephone directory that had the functionality of adding, deleting, and searching for a number in that. I wrote a brute force code for the following, then he asked me to optimize this using trie. For that, I just explained the approach to him. He then asked me a probability question. This interview lasted for 30 min.\n\nThe third round was an HR round to assess my culture fit for the company which lasted for 20 min. It included some standard HR questions and situations. The interviewer was quite friendly and fun to talk to.\n\n3) How to prepare for them?\n\nA) You should prepare DSA thoroughly as it is required in both coding rounds and interviews. Give as many contests on Codeforces and codechef as possible as it will help in solving questions faster in coding rounds. Maintaining consistency is crucial. For interviews, prepare notes for your CV explaining each project and internship. Try to explain the logic to the interviewer while coding the solution.\n\n4) What difficulties did you face while preparing for this Company/Profile? How did you overcome them?\n\nA) DP was a difficult topic in the starting.

Additionally, do certain PORs or EAAs enhance one\u2019s chances of securing this internship?\n\nThere was no such cutoff of CGPA or department for this role. It was open to all the departments. I don\u2019t think PORs contributed that much to get this internship.\n\n6) According to you, who should ideally apply for this job?\n\nA) Anyone who is interested in development and wants to explore software profiles should apply for the Sprinklr intern.\n\n7) Kindly attach your CV/Resume. What are some of the major points you think would be valid to mention in your CV while targeting this profile?\n\nA) Be honest about what you write in your CV and you should be able to explain everything in it. Having a prior intern in your CV will give you an advantage.\n\n8) Lastly, what advice would you like to give to the students aiming to grab CDC internships this year?\n\nA) \u25cf Don\u2019t take too much pressure during the CDC process and be yourself.\n\n\u25cf Get your CV reviewed by seniors and friends.

        "content": "--\n\nListen\n\nHello everyone, I am Abhirup Pal. I am a third-year undergraduate student in the Department of Industrial and Systems Engineering enrolled in its BTech course. I am a boarder of Rajendra Prasad Hall of Residence, I am from Kolkata. I will be joining Sprinklr as a Product Engineer Intern this summer.\n\n2. How did you get into Sprinklr? What was the selection procedure?\n\nThe selection process consisted of an online coding test followed by 3 rounds of interviews: two technical and one HR round.\n\nThe online test consisted of 3 problems of medium-hard difficulty which were to be solved in 90 minutes. The problems were based on binary search, prefix sums, and dynamic programming.\n\nThose who solved 3 problems completely or 2 completely and one partially were shortlisted for the interview rounds.\n\nThe second round of interviews was purely DSA-CP based. The interviewer started by asking a tree problem based on shortest paths. I had not seen that problem before, so I thought for 10\u201312 minutes and explained my thought process. In the end, I gave an incomplete solution that would pass some of the test cases, so he pointed it out. Finally, I gave the complete solution and he told me to code it in a Google doc. The coding portion was rather simple, I only had to write a bfs function and then call it twice in the main function. The interviewer was satisfied, so he moved on to another problem, to which I first gave a brute-force solution followed by a binary search solution. After this, the round was over.\n\nThe HR round lasted only for about 15 minutes. The interviewer was quite friendly, he asked me about my background, my strengths and weaknesses, and some typical situational tasks. He also asked me about the kind of work Sprinklr does and I answered what I had learned from the interviewers in the previous rounds (XD!).\n\n3. How to prepare for them?\n\nThe same way one would prepare for any other software role: DSA-CP. There are a bunch of resources available on the internet for DSA. For practicing DSA at a beginner level, Leetcode is great. Once you are comfortable with basic topics you should participate in Codeforces or Codechef contests or at least upsolve contest problems, this would help you solve new problems during a test or an interview.\n\nIn the last month of preparation, you have to learn CS fundamentals: OOPs are sufficient for BTech, Dual Degree students need to know OS, and DBMS as well. You should be well prepared with your CV as well. Look up common questions and answers based on any skills or projects that you mentioned in your CV. You should also look up common HR questions with answers before the day of the interview, AI tools like ChatGPT can be really helpful in these.\n\n4. When did you start preparing for this role and according to you what is the ideal time for aspirants, to begin their preparation?\n\nI have been into Competitive Programming since my second semester. I did learn DSA, but I gave contests on Codeforces, and I could barely solve A and B of div2. I did CP more seriously from the second year onwards, learned more DSA, and practiced on Leetcode and Codeforces. By the end of the summer after the second year, I could solve 3\u20134 problems in div2 and 5\u20136 problems in div3.\n\nHowever, my ratings were only around 1500 on both of my CF accounts. There is no such ideal time to start preparing, start as early as you can.\n\n5. What difficulties did you face while preparing for this Company/Profile? How did you overcome them?\n\nThe major difficulty I faced was that my rating on codeforces was pretty stagnant. While practicing I could solve 1700\u20131800 rated problems, but could not do so in contests. So, I started solving every contest I participated in, identified my weak topics, and started strengthening them by solving simpler problems on Leetcode and Codeforces. On code forces, a simple rule of thumb is, if your rating is \u2018x\u2019, you should practice problems in the rating range \u2018x\u2019 to \u2018x+300\u2019.\n\nAlso, having a good peer group whom you can discuss problems with always helps.\n\n6. Are there any specific requirements such as department, CGPA, or other criteria for this position? Additionally, do certain PORs or EAAs enhance one\u2019s chances of securing this internship?\n\nThere were no such criteria as CG, POR, or EAAs, however, Sprinklr only allowed BTech students to apply, and BS students were not allowed this year. Anyways, having a decent CG always helps for software-based roles as some companies put CG criteria (&gt;=8 or &gt;=7.5) to apply for them.\n\n7. According to you, who should ideally apply for this job?\n\nAnyone who is interested in software development and Competitive Programming should apply.\n\nAny other skills like ML or Web dev are always helpful.\n\n8. What are some of the major points you think would be valid to mention in your CV while targeting this profile?\n\nYou should know the skills and projects you would mention in your CV well. Apart from this, a CV is not that important, PORs and EAAs do not matter. However, it is always a good idea to get your CV reviewed by your seniors and batchies.\n\n9. Lastly, what advice would you like to give to the students aiming to grab CDC internships this year?\n\nMy only advice would be to keep improving yourself every day, learn and practice as much as possible, do not worry about the result. Do not let the CDC judge your level of preparation, there are a lot of other factors involved like luck, department, etc. which you cannot control. Keep going, enjoy the process, and stay motivated!"

I will be joining AlphaGrep as a Quant intern from May\u201824.\n\n2) How did you get into AlphaGrep? What was the selection procedure?\n\nThe selection process consisted of a coding test followed by three rounds of interviews. The coding test comprised four coding questions based on binary search, dynamic programming and trees mixed with some basic probability concepts. I managed to solve all of them. Those who solved all the questions from non-CSE departments were only shortlisted for interviews. For CSE students, solving 3+ was sufficient.\n\nThe first round involved questions about mean and median. A problem on conditional probability was then given for me to solve. A few basic puzzles, guesstimate and sharpe ratio were followed. The last few questions involved Markov Chains. The interviewer was quite interactive and helpful. He didn\u2019t look for a straight answer and rather insisted on the approach.\n\nThe second round was the toughest one, involving tough questions on probability and mathematics. I was asked about the infinite power tower convergence problem. Then, I was given a puzzle, which was a strategic winning puzzle. These types of questions can be solved if one practices Brainstellar and Fifty Challenging Problems. In this round as well, the approach and letting the interviewer know what you\u2019re thinking was important.\n\nThe third round was on market making. I was asked to estimate the population of Italy. This was followed by creating a spread of 1 crore. The interviewers gave their own spreads regarding the same, and then subsequent transactions were followed by buy and sell. After a few transactions, I was told to correct my spread. After a hint, I was able to correct my spread. This round primarily consisted of market simulation, similar as the stock market. You don\u2019t need to prepare for this round beforehand.\n\n3) How to prepare for them?\n\nYou must be well prepared for DSA and must practice solving questions within a limited time frame. The test scores really matter and not the CGPA, according to me. You can practice on Leetcode, CSES, Codeforces and Atcoder to practice such types of questions. I personally used the AlgoZenith course for my DSA preparation. For the interviews, you must solve Fifty Challenging Problems, Brainstellar and Heard on the Street. Try to maintain a decent Codeforces rating (1600+ will do). If you are targeting a Systems role, go through OS, Networks and OOPS. Make sure you also go through C++ concepts like smart pointers from learncpp.com.\n\n4) When did you start preparing for this role and according to you what is the ideal time for aspirants to begin their preparation?\n\nI started my preparation in the summer after my second year. I couldn\u2019t prepare well in my third year. I resumed it in the summer after my third year.\n\nThe ideal time to start is as early as possible. The first summer is indeed the ideal time to start your preparation. Simply because it is difficult to manage time during classes and other campus activities. Try putting maximum hours\n\nin the holidays to cover up all the syllabus in time, and be miles ahead compared to others. Do not worry if you don\u2019t have much time left, as you will be at your maximum efficiency right now, and one can complete everything if he/she puts in the last-minute effort.\n\n5) What difficulties did you face while preparing for this Company/Profile? How did you overcome them?\n\nThe difficulty that I mainly faced was the rating growth. I was unable to improve my ratings despite my efforts. I overcame them by practicing more and more questions, giving mocks, and clearing all my doubts. I kept myself motivated by giving GoC contests and securing decent ranks on the leaderboard. I tried to give all the contests of Codeforces and Codechef. I also tried sometimes to upsolve the questions of the contests. Remember, practice is the key to growth.\n\n6) Are there any specific requirements such as department, CGPA, or other criteria for this position? Additionally, do certain PORs or EAAs enhance one\u2019s chances of securing this internship?\n\nYes, only circuital departments were allowed, i.e., CS, MA, EC and EE, to register for this position. A minimum CGPA of 8.0 was also required to sit for the tests.\n\nNo PORs or EAAs will usually enhance one\u2019s chances of securing this internship. However, at the end of my second interview round, I was asked about what I do in my free time. Here, if you answer chess, bridge, or poker, it can slightly enhance your chances.\n\n7) According to you, who should ideally apply for this job?\n\nOnes who are targeting Software or Quant roles should ideally apply for this position, as getting into AlphaGrep requires preparation for these roles. Those preparing for Data roles, if you practice coding questions well, you should too sit for this role.\n\n8) Kindly attach your CV/Resume. What are some of the major points you think would be valid to mention in CV while targeting this profile?\n\nCV is not really important in this role. As long as you have good ratings and good problem-solving skills, you are good to go. You can keep 2\u20133 projects primarily based on coding. If you don\u2019t have any, try finding some simple projects on the web. Mention your ratings of different platforms in the CV. Also, mention your ranks in various contests you have achieved. Try incorporating Machine Learning and Deep Learning as well; this will slightly increase your chances. PORs will certainly not help, but it is not a problem if you have them on your resume. They asked me for a summary of my resume in Round 1, and that\u2019s it. They don\u2019t really care about your CV. Please note this is not true for other companies.\n\n9) Lastly, what advice would you like to give to the students aiming to grab CDC internships this year?\n\nPrepare well and give the time it requires. Make sure you maintain calm and composure during the coding tests. This is the time when you should focus on performing extremely well in a few tests rather than performing \u201cdecent\u201d in a lot. Even if you screw up a lot of tests, it is totally fine. You must manage to perform great in a few. Have a small group of friends to discuss and to keep each other motivated. For the interviews, I would recommend asking your batchmates and/or seniors to help you with your last-minute preparation, like your introduction and HR. Do not indulge yourself in some courses that won\u2019t help you a lot and would just consume your time. Discuss with your friends and your mentor about your preparation and take their advice. Remember, communication is the key part in an interview; always speak your \u201cmind.\u201d Also, understand that CDC is not the end of the world and try to stay calm throughout the process."

        "content": "--\n\nListen\n\n1) Brief introduction and description of the offered role\n\nA: My name is Sayantan Sarkar. I am a third-year undergraduate student of the Department of Mechanical Engineering, enrolled in its B. Tech course. I am from Howrah, West Bengal, and a boarder of JCB Hall of Residence.\n\nI have been offered an internship in the Mechatronics profile of Jaguar Land Rover. This is a core profile and mainly delves into the automotive industry. JLR is a fast-progressing company manufacturing luxury cars and is the luxury brand of TATA.\n\n2) How did you get into Jaguar Land Rover? What was the selection procedure?\n\nA; I am a huge automotive enthusiast and I was primarily aiming for the core profile in the CDC Internship process. Being in TeamKART, the official Formula Student Team of IIT Kharagpur, I was already aware of the intricacies of automotive engineering and this helped me a lot in getting selected to JLR. Apart from that, my passion for core mechanical engineering was another driving factor behind my selection.\n\nThe selection procedure consisted of 2 rounds:\n\n3) How to prepare for them?\n\nA: Aptitude Section: For this section, there is no strategy of preparation. It all comes from IQ and lots of practice. Here, students generally solve the questions in GFG and many other websites that offer aptitude questions. You can practice them in your leisure time, but there is no requirement for a dedicated timeline of preparation.\n\nMechatronics Section: For this part, You need to cover the concepts of the subjects in the curriculum of the Mechanical Engineering Department and the related disciplines. The most important chapters asked here are Mechanics of Solids, Fluid Mechanics, Design of Machine Elements, Kinematics and Kinetics of Machines, Basic Thermodynamics(including all the cycles there in the syllabus), and IC Engines. A knowledge of Basic Electronics is important too. However, the Basic Electronics course is conducted in most of the departments, so it carries on well. Solving the last 10 years of GATE Mechanical PYQ will surely help in acing this section since plenty of questions come of similar pattern.\n\nCoding Section: For students applying solely for the Mechatronics profile, only 2 coding questions were asked, and were of medium level. For preparing, regular practice of easy and medium-level competitive programming problems on platforms like Codeforces and Leetcode will do. The coding round has less weightage for this profile and questions are doable too.\n\n4) When did you start preparing for this role and according to you what is the ideal time for aspirants to begin their preparation?\n\nA: Preparation starts from the day you start reading Science. Every concept you gain, and every problem you solve adds to the insights you gain and eventually helps in the long run. Being in TeamKART, we were trained extensively in theoretical as well as hands-on training during our tenure. Also, being in other research groups like ARK and KRSSG in their mechanical teams, every work I did, the designs I contributed, and the environment that I got, added more and more to my love for core mechanical engineering, and hence the knowledge came forth almost spontaneously. As the summer vacation started, I started revising my concepts from my second-year courses and also started practicing MCQ questions. I was aiming mainly for JLR and Bajaj since they were the only 2 core mechanical companies(especially, in automotive roles) coming within CDC Day 2. I also found some nice projects to work on under a few professors which diversified my role.\n\nAccording to me, the ideal time for starting preparation is as soon as the summer vacation begins. Many students start to get involved in mugging up random things for CDC during the semester and feel like being ahead of time will help. Maybe it does but sacrificing semester studies is not worth it, is what I feel. Whatever others might tell, CG, to some extent, MATTERS, at least it is required to keep CG above 8. The companies might not give a CG cutoff officially, but internally, it does help in filtering out students. So, better concentrate on the semester when it is going on. It is advisable to find core projects and extensively work on them during the 3 months of vacation. You can also take up Internships and projects in other IITs or Industries, only if it gives you ample time to carry out your preparation simultaneously.\n\n5) What difficulties did you face while preparing for this Company/Profile? How did you overcome them?\n\nA: The major difficulties I faced during my preparation were:\n\n6) Are there any specific requirements such as department, CGPA, or other criteria for this position? Additionally, do certain PORs or EAAs enhance one\u2019s chances of securing this internship?\n\nA: The specific requirements are as follows:\n\n7) According to you, who should ideally apply for this job?\n\nA: According to me, people with true dedication to core mechanical fields, be it interest in vehicle dynamics, be it fluids or robotics, etc. are advised to surely apply for this profile. Again, there is this system that if you apply for more than one profile, you will still have only one test. For example, if you are applying for both mechatronics and software, then you will have a single test with aptitude, mechatronics, and software sections, with 3 coding questions instead of 2 and higher weightage on software. So, selection in a profile is where you scored higher. The chances of selection in those cases are lesser. So, avoid applying in more than one profile. Another point is if you are not seriously targeting your future in the core, it is not recommended to waste your time preparing intensively for this job. Better invest it wisely in preparing for your profile. Don\u2019t just fall for peer pressure.\n\n8) Kindly attach your CV/Resume. What are some of the major points you think would be valid to mention in your CV while targeting this profile?\n\nA: My CV at the time of applying for CDC is attached in the Google form. The major points you need to highlight in your CV for people targeting this profile are as follows:\n\n9) Lastly, what advice would you like to give to the students aiming to grab CDC internships this year?\n\nA: Last advice I would give all of you aiming to grab CDC this season, BELIEVE IN YOURSELF. You have skills you have never thought of. As I said before, accept this as a phase of life. Don\u2019t take it as a necessity of your life like you did during your entrance preparations. Rather, take it as a learning process. For example, suppose, you read 3rd-year courses during this time at the end of the 2nd year, even if you don\u2019t crack the exam, you will lessen your load during the upcoming semester. If you appear for GATE the following year, again that will be useful, since you know the concepts and already tried yourself at the PYQs. As I said, every knowledge you intake, you will get paid for that for sure someday. CDC is a long process, continues till next year April, and happens in 2 phases. Keep patience and move on. If you get selected in interviews, don\u2019t consider it as a question-answer session, rather look at it as a discussion. The more you get a vibe check, the more successful you will be. They always want you to reach the answer by some means, and they have no reason to demote you. Be honest, and be true to yourself. Don\u2019t fake answers. If you can\u2019t answer some questions, admit it. If you want to take time, ask them for 2 minutes to think. And don\u2019t think quietly, talk with yourself while thinking of an answer. This will help the Interviewer know your thought process. This increases your chances of selection. Well, even after all of this, if nothing happens, you have MITACS, DAAD, SPARK, and a lot of other internships coming ahead. Then there are projects here too under the professors. Life is way too big. Don\u2019t just get stopped by any hurdle coming by. Move forward. The world is waiting for you. Remember, you are an IITian.\n\nALL THE BEST EVERYONE !!!"

        "content": "FORESIGHT(2024) : Internship at Goldman Sachs | Vipin |\n\n--\n\n1\n\nListen\n\n1. Brief introduction and description of offered role.\n\nHello, I am Vipin Kumar, a 4th-year dual degree student in the Mechanical Engineering Department. In this blog, I\u2019ll talk about how I got a summer internship offer at Goldman Sachs as a quantitative strategist.\n\n2. How did you get into Goldman sachs? What was the selection process?\n\nImagine this: you apply on a whim, not checking the shortlist because you think it\u2019s a long shot, and then a buddy tells you you\u2019re in! That was my experience.\n\nThe process started when I submitted my CV for the quant intern role, not very sure at that time as I was majorly focusing on ML roles. The first filter was an online test with a mix of 20 questions \u2014 math, probability, coding, ml, and aptitude. I managed around 15 of these. Out of my expectations, I was shortlisted for the interview.\n\nWhat followed were three intense rounds of interviews where I was grilled on everything from my internships and projects to data structure, probability and statistics, puzzles, and machine learning algorithms. Each interview round peeled back another layer, pushing me to showcase not just what I knew, but how I thought and approached problems.\n\n3. How do you prepare for them?\n\nSimple but effective rule: You need consistent practice and a bit of strategy.\n\nI was preparing for analytics profiles. So, I immersed myself in machine learning and data science projects for over a year, which was like building stamina. Then, three months before the CDC internship, I started sprinting; I focused on data structures and algorithms, probability concepts, and aptitude questions. Engaging with competitive programming on platforms like Codeforces, and Leetcode helped me a lot to prepare in a time-constrained setup.\n\nYou need to balance focus on technical skills with a broader engagement in relevant projects. This not only builds your expertise but also gives you plenty to talk about in interviews.\n\n4. Are there any specific requirements such as department, CGPA, or other criteria for this position? Additionally, do certain PORs or EAAs enhance one\u2019s chance of getting this internship?\n\nGoldman Sachs is quite inclusive regarding academic backgrounds; they don\u2019t restrict applications based on your department. However, CGPA does play a role, especially for quant positions \u2014 higher is usually better, but it\u2019s not the sole decider.\n\nAs for Positions of Responsibility (PORs) or Extra Academic Activities (EAAs), they\u2019re not necessary but can certainly help in building your soft skills like teamwork and communication, which are crucial during interviews.\n\n5. According to you, who should apply for this job?\n\nIf you\u2019re the type who thrives on challenges, especially those involving numbers or complex problems, this opportunity is tailor-made for you. You don\u2019t need a background in finance for this role in GS, but a decent foundation in mathematics, statistics, and problem-solving is crucial. The role is perfect for those who enjoy dissecting multilayered problems, whether in competitive programming, mathematical problems, or similar domains. If problem-solving excites you, don\u2019t hesitate to apply\n\n6. What are some of the major points you think would be valid to mention in CV while targeting this profile?\n\nYour CV should highlight relevant projects and internships, particularly those involving data science, machine learning, or any quantitative analysis. Demonstrating your proficiency in DSA through competitive programming rankings or notable achievements will give you an edge. Remember, clarity and relevance are key \u2014 make sure every item on your CV aligns with the skills required for your targeted role.\n\n7. What advice would you like to give to students aiming to grab a CDC internship this year?\n\nFirst off, keep the preparation running and polishing your skills, but also make time to step away and spend time with friends \u2014 you don\u2019t want to be overwhelmed by this hectic process.\n\nSecond, when you\u2019re in the interview, treat it like a problem-solving session with your friends or mentor. Be honest when you\u2019re stumped \u2014 ask for hints or discuss your thought process. Interviewers aren\u2019t just interested in the right answer, but how you approach problems.\n\nAnd remember, last-minute applications can sometimes lead to unexpected opportunities. So, even if it\u2019s the eleventh hour and you have no expectations, throw your hat in the ring \u2014 you might just be exactly what they\u2019re looking for!"

        "info": "I recommend revising the PDS course and practicing implementation-based questions on Hackerrank and CF Div 2 (A, B) & Div 3 (A, B, C, D) questions to get a grip on writing code.",
        "content": "FORESIGHT(2024): Internship at Databricks | Bhuvan Rangoju |\n\n--\n\nListen\n\n1)Brief introduction and description of the offered role\n\nHello, I\u2019m Bhuvan Rangoju, a 4th-year Integrated MSc student from the Department of Mathematics. I\u2019ve been offered a software internship at Databricks. In this blog, I\u2019ll share my journey in preparing for this role, my mistakes, and a few personal tips.\n\n2) How did you get into Databricks? What was the selection procedure?\n\nGetting into Databricks is not different from how you\u2019d get into a typical software company. At first, we had an online assessment (90 minutes) consisting of 4 questions selected from a pool of 10\u201315 straightforward questions; order n3 and n4 solutions were also accepted. The company shortlisted only circuital (and MnC) students who completed all four questions with an early submission. Unfortunately, I got stuck on one of the questions, which took most of my time, so I didn\u2019t make it into the initial shortlist. But it was decent enough to get a shortlist on the extended list.\n\nThere were three interview (online) rounds(coding + coding + HR). The order of rounds varied among different candidates.\n\nMy first coding round consisted of a single question, which I found quite challenging. The problem was to print a path from the start node to the end node in a Fibonacci tree(I still don\u2019t know what it is). I had to ask numerous questions to clarify the problem and begin coding. The interviewer was very friendly and supportive, which helped me stay calm. I asked a bunch of questions and communicated with the interviewer all the time, and within 45 minutes or so, I was able to finish the code, with which the interviewer seemed satisfied. Fortunately, my coding style \u2014 modularized functions, appropriate variable names, and clarifying comments helped me barely pass this round.\n\nThe second round was fairly easy compared to the previous round. I was asked two easy questions. The first one is a straightforward recursion with memoized DP. The second one was related to the Sliding window. Initially, I gave an O(nlogn) solution, but the interviewer was expecting a linear time complexity, which I was able to get at the very end of the interview using a deque with the help of a few hints.\n\nThe third round consisted of the typical resume grilling followed by an HR interview conducted by the Director of the Engineering team. He delved into every detail of my resume, from past internships to projects to PORs. Therefore, it\u2019s crucial to thoroughly review your resume before any interview, as you wouldn\u2019t want to miss an opportunity that could have been secured with just 1\u20132 hours of preparation.\n\n3) How did you prepare for them?\n\nIn my second year, I decided to target Software/ML roles for my CDC internship drive. Assuming you now understand the importance of CP, I won\u2019t emphasize this fact and will dive right into my preparation. Like any other beginner with coding, I was confused and overwhelmed by the abundance of resources available on the internet. After consulting some of my seniors, I started practicing on Codeforces & CSES in my 3rd semester. After a few months of consistent efforts, I reached a specialist rating. Unsatisfied with the fact that I struggled to reach an Expert rating, I felt a bit demotivated and discontinued CP for a while. But I continued giving contests now and then and up-solving questions, hoping to increase my rating. The summer of 2022 (just after the 4th sem) is when I became more serious and disciplined and focused more on learning new and difficult concepts that would help me in the long run. I felt pretty confident that I could clear most OAs even though I was just a specialist. It was during the winter break(December 2022) that I got into the dark blue zone, and I finally felt that my efforts had paid off. And just like that, I left CP, and since then, I haven\u2019t given more than a handful of contests and have practiced solving questions.\n\nBeing a non-CS guy, I had to teach myself OOPs(object-oriented programming). An NPTEL course by Partha Pratim Das (PPD) and practicing a handful of questions were enough to clear most OOP rounds. During my Mitacs internship in the summer of 2023(just before the internship drive), I did Interviewbit and Leetcode, which seemed easy given the knowledge and level of preparation I had by doing CP. As I said in the beginning, I also aimed for ML roles in companies like (Adobe, Amex, etc.) for which I read online blogs on ML algos and a playlist by Patrick Loeber on YouTube, which taught writing ML algos from scratch, which I genuinely enjoyed. I also did a bit of Probability & Statistics and puzzles from the standard books like Heard on the Street, 50 Challenging Problems in Probability, and BrainStellar, just in case I get shortlisted for quant roles, which I honestly had no hopes, given my CG (8.9), and CF rating(1695).\n\n4) What difficulties did you face while preparing for this Company/Profile? How did you overcome them?\n\nOne of the most common hurdles a beginner faces is not getting their basics cleared and directly moving on to intermediate concepts. I recommend revising the PDS course and practicing implementation-based questions on Hackerrank and CF Div 2 (A, B) & Div 3 (A, B, C, D) questions to get a grip on writing code. Learn STL in C++, which saves a lot of time when solving complicated and multi-concept questions from a resource of your choice.\n\nI never learned anything in a structured way and used to solve questions randomly based on tags on CF. Just before my OAs started, I spent some time on the USACO guide, which has everything organized and questions topic-wise sorted by difficulty. You can check that out. I also recommend taking up the Algozenith course by Vivek Gupta; the quality of questions and video lectures are to the point (worth every penny), which I had gotten to know just before my CDC interviews, so I couldn\u2019t complete it.\n\nMost of you must not have had any experience with OOP, so you can refer to any online course in the NPTEL / YouTube playlist to learn the basics. An in-depth understanding is required in software roles in quant companies for which people recommend learning from online websites like learncpp.com.\n\nI haven\u2019t focused much on fundamental computer science topics like Operating Systems, Computer Networks, and Databases. However, these are essential for quant roles. I recommend discussing with your peers or seniors in computer science for guidance.\n\n5) Are there any specific requirements such as department, CGPA, or other criteria for this position? Additionally, do certain PORs or EAAs enhance one\u2019s chances of securing this internship?\n\nDatabricks shortlists only circuital(CS, EC, EE) and MnC students with a CG of 9+. PORs and EAAs hardly play any role in the shortlisting process (except consulting roles). It only adds a point to discuss in the HR round and shows that you have worked with people or in a team (Kshtij Tech team in my case) before, which reflects the cooperative nature of the candidate.\n\n6) According to you, who should ideally apply for this job?\n\nAnyone interested in coding, solving algorithmic problems, designing applications, or just curious about working in the tech industry should apply.\n\n7) What are some of the major points you think would be valid to mention in your CV while targeting this profile?\n\nYou can find my CV below. Some points to keep in mind specific to software/quant roles: 1) Maintain a decent CG (9+).\n\n2) Do CP as much as possible, and try your best to reach Candidate Master.\n\n3) Mention your rating on various coding platforms like CF, CC, Leetcode, and Kickstart, Hackercup ranks (if they are good enough)\n\n4) Prior internship(s) is/are not a must, but have at least a couple of projects.\n\n5) Be thorough with every word in your CV and get it reviewed by seniors before finalizing it.\n\n9) Lastly, what advice would you like to give the students aiming to grab CDC internships this year?\n\nTake your preparation seriously. A couple of months of dedicated and planned preparation can have a significant impact on your result. Have a couple of friends who are there for you to compare and discuss stuff and to relax yourself from the stress and pressure you\u2019d be carrying during the CDC phase. Be consistent and enjoy the journey. Don\u2019t lose hope if you don\u2019t get a Day 1 company; I didn\u2019t. Just remember hard work and honesty always pays off, if not now, soon enough.\n\nLastly, I would like to thank my parents and my nagging sister for bringing the best out of me; my friend Lakshman Kattunga for challenging me (and helping me out in a few contests :) and Roopak Priyadarshi who boasted me now and then, and simplifying Div2 Ds for people like me to understand.\n\nI wish my juniors luck and all the best!"

        "content": "FORESIGHT(2024) |Internship at Bajaj Auto | Ashutosh Dash\n\n--\n\nListen\n\nHello everyone! My name is Ashutosh Dash. I am a 4th year undergraduate student of the department of Mechanical Engineering with a specialization in Financial Engineering. I am from Bhubaneswar, Odisha. I will be joining Bajaj Auto as a summer intern in its R&D Department for the summer of \u201824.\n\n2. How did you get into Bajaj Auto\u00a0? What was the selection procedure?\n\n3. How to prepare for them?\n\nPreparation for Bajaj Auto\u2019s selection process should be methodical and precise. For the technical test, it\u2019s crucial to have a solid grasp of core mechanical subjects like Solid Mechanics, Thermodynamics, Heat Transfer etc. and should also have a decent understanding of some first year mathematics stuff like numerical estimations, solving differential equations etc. Revision from class notes and additional problems from textbooks can be very helpful as and when you encounter these courses in your semesters. For the psychometric and interview rounds, it\u2019s beneficial to get your core and basic concepts of mechanical engineering clear and have a thorough understanding of what you have learnt through your semesters. Familiarity with your own projects and coursework is key, as these are common topics during interviews. Confidence and fluency both during interview and psychometric tests are some of the soft skills that you should develop in the last days of your preparation.\n\n4. When did you start preparing for this role, and what is the ideal time for aspirants to begin their preparation?\n\nI started preparing for this role towards the end of my third year, practically during the summer vacation before the internship selection sessions. Ideally, aspirants should begin their preparation at least 3\u20134 months before the internship season starts. Prior to this they should be involved enough in the courses throughout the semesters in the courses they take both as Core as well as Depth Electives. This can smoothen their preparations, instigate more confidence in them and help them avoid last minute rush and rough preparations. In case a candidate has been sincere enough throughout their semesters, 3\u20134 months is an ample amount of time to strengthen their understanding of both core mechanical concepts and develop soft skills essential for acing multiple rounds of interviews.\n\n5. What difficulties did you face while preparing for this Company/Profile? How did you overcome them?\n\nThe MCQ test that you will initially face will have 90 questions to be completed within 90 minutes, placing a significant emphasis on your speed and accuracy. Without a solid understanding of the concepts, you may find it challenging to answer a substantial number of questions within the allotted time. Therefore, my suggestion would be to keep practicing as many questions as possible once you conclude your preparation, so that you can be at your best possible speed and accuracy on the day of the test\n\nOne major challenge was balancing the preparation for multiple profiles, as each of them have distinct requirements. To manage this, I structured my study schedule to allocate specific times for core mechanical subjects as well as other profiles that I was preparing for.\n\nOne piece of advice would be in case you are going for preparations for multiple profiles and one of them is core, then you may choose the others to be non-technical profiles as choosing a mixture of both core as well as technical profiles like SDE and Data Science will more often lead you towards a greater cloud of confusion and will hinder the completeness of your preparation towards either of the chosen profiles. Whenever and wherever stuck, I would suggest engaging in discussions with peers, seniors and professors in order to obtain deeper insights and to get your doubts clarified effectively.\n\n6. Are there any specific requirements such as department, CGPA, or other criteria for this position? Additionally, do certain PORs or EAAs enhance one\u2019s chances of securing this internship?\n\nThe internship at Bajaj Auto primarily targets mechanical engineering students, although candidates from related fields are also considered if they have relevant skills. A CGPA of above 8.5 is generally preferred (although the cut off to sit for tests is 7.0) and CGPA does hold a great deal of importance atleast during the interviews.\n\nOne more important aspect is the quality of projects that you would have done in your respective departments. They actually get a lot of content to hold conversation with you and engage with your interests in case you have any such interesting projects in your resume. So my suggestion would be to at least have two or more projects written on your resume in order to craft the interview in your desired direction and to base it on the topics in which you feel most confident about.\n\nHolding positions of responsibility or engaging in extracurricular activities can also enhance a candidate\u2019s profile by demonstrating leadership and teamwork skills but in case anyone doesn\u2019t have them, they need to worry as these are just brownie points and the recruiters do not stress very much on these segments during the interview.\n\n7. According to you, who should ideally apply for this job?\n\nThis role is best suited for individuals who are passionate about the automotive industry, particularly those with a strong foundation in mechanical engineering principles. It is also well-suited for someone who is interested in mechanical engineering and wants to explore more about the industrial and real-life applications of the academics that they have learnt till then. This role is also well suited for people who want to explore cross-domain applications of mechanical engineering like how mechanical engineering can intersect with emerging technologies like EVs etc.\n\n8. Kindly attach your CV/Resume. What are some of the major points you think would be valid to mention in CV while targeting this profile?\n\nKey points to include in the CV for this role would be relevant coursework, projects, and any internships that demonstrate applied mechanical engineering skills. Additionally, leadership roles in technical clubs or teams can also be significant, as they show an ability to manage projects and work collaboratively.\n\n9. Lastly, what advice would you like to give to the students aiming to grab CDC internships this year?\n\nMy advice would be to focus on understanding your core subjects thoroughly and to get involved in hands-on projects or research that can showcase your skills. Try to maintain your CGPA as high as possible by focussing on the academics taught during the semesters, as it stands out as a crucial parameter of judgment atleast for core profiles. In case you can, try to maintain a well-rounded profile with extracurricular activities that highlight your leadership and teamwork capabilities. Lastly, be proactive in seeking feedback on your CV and prepare diligently for interviews by reviewing common questions and practicing with peers or mentors."

        "content": "--\n\nListen\n\n1) Brief introduction and description of offered role\n\nHi, everyone! I\u2019m Pranav Kulkarni, a fourth-year dual-degree CSE student at IIT Kharagpur. I am a boarder of Nehru Hall of Residence. I will intern at AlphaGrep Securities as a Software Developer in the Summer of 2024.\n\n2) How did you get into AlphaGrep? What was the selection procedure?\n\nThe selection procedure consists of a common coding round for quant and software developer roles and a series of interviews.\n\nThe coding round had 4 DSA questions to be solved in 90 minutes. They were from a varying range of difficulties. The most straightforward question was based on a standard LIS problem, then a question based on ranges and intervals, which was easily solvable using sets, and then a question based on tree travel involving probabilities consisting of printing precise decimal values; the most challenging question was an observation-based one which was also solvable using binary search on the answer. I solved all four questions within 50 minutes. Implementation skills matter a lot in these rounds. Even if you get the logic correct, you may make silly mistakes in your implementation, thus wasting vital time debugging your code. I was shortlisted for both Software and Quant profiles.\n\nMy interview consisted of three rounds, with questions involving CS core concepts like data types, data structures, static & dynamic polymorphism, inheritance, smart pointers, caching and paging, TCP & UDP, mutex and DSA concepts like DP, graphs, sliding window, tree, and arrays. Some of the questions involved facts that I wasn\u2019t aware of, but my logical approach while thinking of answers helped me get through them.\n\n3) How to prepare for them?\n\nTo get shortlisted, DSA is the most essential required skill to ace the coding rounds for software developer roles. Apart from regular contests on Codeforces, CodeChef & Atcoder, participate in competitions like ICPC, HackerCup, etc. Mentioning good ranks in these competitions significantly boosts one\u2019s CV.\n\nIf you are targeting HFTs, good practice of object-oriented programming is crucial, as some of the HFTs specifically test this skill during coding rounds.\n\nI primarily practiced the standard DSA topics like DP, Segment Trees, Trees and Graphs from CSES and AtCoder, and got an idea about how they are asked in the coding tests from the previous years\u2019 GOC CDC series.\n\nI\u2019d recommend preparing for OOPS and thoroughly knowing C++ STL containers and Operating System concepts to crack the interview. I followed the course slides to prepare for the OOPS and CS core concepts. To prepare for interview-specific DSA questions, I practiced using InterviewBit questions.\n\n4) When did you start preparing for this role and according to you what is the ideal time for aspirants to begin their preparation?\n\nI started my preparation for the software developer role at the start of my third year, as the topics covered during the courses were mostly related to core system design concepts. During the semesters, I couldn\u2019t devote any time to learning DSA due to my focus on maintaining my CGPA and learning all the Lab courses with a thorough understanding and practice.\n\nDuring the winter break of the third year, I started learning basic concepts like STL, which are essential for competitive programming. As I was very new to competitive programming, it took me the whole of December to learn the necessary basics.\n\nMy summer before CDC started with me as a pupil on the Codeforces and a 3-star coder on the CodeChef. With these not-so-good stats of competitive programming, I devoted the month of May to learning and practicing new DSA concepts. It was tough for me to learn and practice new DSA and OOPS concepts during the summer, so I recommend that others start learning these concepts during the breaks of the second year.\n\n5) What difficulties did you face while preparing for this Company/Profile? How did you overcome them?\n\nAs I said, the most significant difficulty I faced while preparing for the CDC was the need for more practice of DSA. To overcome this, I had to stick to standard practice questions from CSES and InterviewBit and rely on my problem-solving and implementation ability to solve questions in the coding rounds.\n\n6) Are there any specific requirements such as department, CGPA, or other criteria for this position? Additionally, do certain PORs or EAAs enhance one\u2019s chances of securing this internship?\n\nThe role was open only for circuital branches like CS, MA, EC, EE, and IE. The shortlist and priority to appear for the interview were based entirely on the test performance, so criteria like CGPA, POR, and EAAs didn\u2019t make any difference.\n\n7) According to you, who should ideally apply for this job?\n\nAny student who is highly interested in system design, has good implementation skills & a grip over DSA, enjoys fast-paced learning, and is highly efficient in programming should ideally apply for this job.\n\n8) Kindly attach your CV/Resume. What are some of the major points you think would be valid to mention in CV while targeting this profile?\n\nHaving a high rating on Codeforces is always a major plus. You can also mention the ranks you obtained in popular coding contests such as Google Kickstart and Facebook HackerCup. If you have taken part in ICPC, mention that too.\n\n9) Lastly, what advice would you like to give to the students aiming to grab CDC internships this year?\n\nApart from talent and preparation, the procedure for grabbing an internship through the CDC depends on many other factors, such as your confidence, luck, communication, etc. I recommend you form a group of friends who are targeting the same profile as the resources and information you learn from them will consistently benefit in this luck-dependent, random process. Always believe in yourself, and don\u2019t get disheartened or overconfident by your performance in the coding rounds.\n\nAll the best for upcoming CDC internships!!\n\n1) Brief introduction and description of offered role\n\nHi, everyone!

        "content": "--\n\nListen\n\n1) A brief introduction and description of the offered role.\n\nA) Hello Everyone, I hope you guys are doing well. I am Mohd Amaan, a soon-to-be fourth-year undergraduate student from the Department of Electrical Engineering. I hail from Roorkee, Uttarakhand, and am a boarder of Patel Hall of Residence. Through the CDC process, I was able to get an internship in the software development role at Amazon.\n\n2) How did you get into Amazon? What was the selection procedure?\n\nA) Amazon came to campus on Day 3. We had one initial screening round, which consisted of two questions. There was a question bank, and the questions were more on the easy side, though there was some inconsistency with the environment. One was on basic strings, and the second question was based on iterative DP, which was easy but gave me some errors in two cases that were platform-specific. Most of the people completed the test within the first 15 minutes themselves. After getting the shortlist, we had only 1 interview which was a long one (1 hour+ in my case), which consisted of three questions, which were again on the easy side. The topics were binary search, binary trees, and linked lists. The interviewer just asked me to write the pseudocode, though I wrote the full code for all three questions.\n\n3) How to prepare for them?\n\nA) If I were to specifically refer to my experience with giving interviews at Amazon and Piramal, Leetcode/Algozenith would suffice for both the interview and the OA. But looking at the overall CDC experience, Competitive Programming prepared me to think about solutions with better speed and improved my code writing speed, which in general helped me in OAs and the interview itself. Leetcode/Algozenith is the cake, and CP is the topping XD\n\n4) When did you start preparing for this role and according to you what is the ideal time for aspirants to begin their preparation?\n\nA) I started preparing as soon as I went home for the summer vacation. I\u2019ll say that there\u2019s no ideal time. Start as early as you can, and don\u2019t panic. If you are someone starting summer vacations, I suggest you practice in chunks and divide your time between theory and problem-solving. Mine was something like 20:80, with 80 being the problem-solving.\n\n5) What difficulties did you face while preparing for this Company/Profile? How did you overcome them?\n\nA) In between the preparations, I felt like I had reached a steady state, which was not the case, which made me a bit laggy in between. My friends\u2019 group proved to be the most effective solution, providing me with assistance at every stage. We had formed a group to discuss daily practice, any challenges someone was facing, contests, etc. We spent hours on call discussing the edge cases and where the code might fail, which gave me confidence in the OAs.\n\n6) Are there any specific requirements such as department, CGPA, or other criteria for this position? Additionally, do certain PORs or EAAs enhance one\u2019s chances of securing this internship?\n\nA) From a departmental perspective, the answer is no. CG greater than 8 would be preferred. Amazon has some LPs (Leadership Principles) on which they focus a lot. I didn\u2019t have a resume grilling round, but surely a resume carries importance.\n\n7) According to you, who should ideally apply for this job?\n\nA) Anyone looking to work on scaling large systems that have a direct impact on the tech sector should apply for the position.\n\n8) Kindly attach your CV/Resume. What are some of the major points you think would be valid to mention in your CV while targeting this profile?\n\nA) They generally do not give much importance to resumes, but again, they have some Leadership principles on which they focus a lot. You never know what portion of your resume might attract the interviewer. Prepare a good resume and go through it thoroughly.\n\n9) Lastly, what advice would you like to give to the students aiming to grab CDC internships this year?\n\nA) Just keep yourself calm. Carry on the grind and eventually, you will make it. You won\u2019t feel you have done enough at any point because there are endless things to learn. Just keep on grinding, do CP, practice more problems, build a good resume, and you will be there."

        "info": "You should know the contents of your CV inside out. Imagine being woken up at 4 a.m. and having to defend a particular internship or project on your CV without hesitation. Be ready to answer 5\u20136 follow-up questions about each",
        "content": "--\n\nListen\n\n1) Brief introduction and description of the offered role\n\nA) Hello! My name is Tejas Saxena, and I am a fourth-year undergraduate student in the Department of Chemical Engineering, specializing in Financial Engineering. I hail from Mumbai, Maharashtra. My primary focus is in the field of Finance, and I have earned notable certifications, including Chartered Financial Analyst (Level 1) and Financial Risk Manager.\n\nI recently received an internship offer from Nomura, where I am working in their International Wealth Management (IWM) division. I am currently working as a Global Markets Analyst at their Powai office in Mumbai.\n\n2) How did you get into Nomura? What was the selection procedure?\n\nA) Nomura is one of the largest investment banks in Asia and the leading Investment Bank in Japan has an impressive global footprint. At Kgp, Nomura typically recruits for three roles: Global Markets (GM) Analyst, GM Algo Quant, and Wholesale Strategy (WS). Although I was shortlisted for both WS and GM Analyst positions, I ultimately received an offer for the GM Analyst role, which I will elaborate on here.\n\nNomura\u2019s selection process begins with the release of the shortlist, which happens about two days before Day 1. On Day 0, shortlisted candidates participate in Group Discussions (GDs) for the available roles. Those who advance past the GD stage proceed to Day 1, which involves around 3\u20134 personal interviews (PIs). Successfully navigating these stages culminates in an internship offer. Now, let\u2019s delve into each part of this process.\n\nGroup Discussion: The GD typically revolves around a current macroeconomic issue prevalent in the Global Financial Markets. For my session, the topic was, \u201cWhat are your thoughts on inflation? Will this inflation in 2023 be sticky or not?\u201d The discussion lasted approximately 12 minutes, excluding the 3-minute preparation time, during which recruiters meticulously noted our points. After the discussion, they cross-examined us on our statements to verify our understanding and ensure we weren\u2019t merely reciting information without theoretical or empirical backing. For instance, I mentioned Fitch downgrading the US credit rating, highlighting potential shifts from equity to bond markets as seen in 2012. The interviewer asked me to explain what Fitch is and the significance of credit ratings. The session concluded with a puzzle on contiguous sequences, which we had to solve in 5 minutes.\n\nPersonal Interviews: Most of the questions directed at me during the interviews were centered around my CV. I had prior internships in Corporate Strategy, Equity Research, and Data Analysis, along with several finance-related projects. The interviewers focused particularly on my Equity Research internship and finance projects. Each interview lasted around 40 minutes. Given that I had cleared CFA Level 1 and FRM Part 1, the interviewers extensively grilled me on finance-related concepts. Although I struggled with some probability, statistics, and puzzle-based questions, my strong foundation in finance compensated for these areas. I underwent two interviews for the GM Analyst role and one for the WS role, followed by a 15-minute HR interview. Subsequently, I received the internship offer.\n\n3) How to prepare for them?\n\nA) I cannot stress enough the importance of thorough CV preparation. You should know the contents of your CV inside out. Imagine being woken up at 4 a.m. and having to defend a particular internship or project on your CV without hesitation. Be ready to answer 5\u20136 follow-up questions about each item. If your project or internship aligns with the interviewer\u2019s expertise, they might delve into a 20-minute discussion on that very topic.\n\nHaving a solid grasp of finance is a significant advantage. If you have completed internships or projects in finance or have cleared exams like CFA or FRM, you can use this to steer the interview. Questions like \u201cWhat are your two favorite financial securities?\u201d or \u201cWhich market would you recommend to an investor?\u201d are opportunities to guide the conversation toward your strengths. For instance, you could mention Equities or Fixed Income and discuss valuation methods, or talk about Options and Derivatives, elaborating on strategies like Straddle, Strangle, or Butterfly Spread. But most importantly, if you do not know something, then don\u2019t try to talk your way out of it by giving a random answer. Your interviewer would most likely be in a director-level position in the organization, so you won\u2019t be able to fool your way out of the interview!\n\nGeneral awareness of the financial world is also crucial. Be prepared for questions about historical events or recent developments in finance. For example, some of my peers were asked about the SVB and Credit Suisse collapse and its implications, while others faced questions about the 2008 Financial Crisis. These topics can also come up in group discussions. Therefore, stay informed by reading newspapers like the Mint, Bloomberg, or WSJ. I read the Financial Times and The Economist for global affairs, and The Ken for Indian and South Asian news daily.\n\nAs the interview nears its conclusion, interviewers typically ask if you have any questions for them. Always have insightful questions prepared. I recommend reading the company\u2019s Annual Report, particularly the CEO\u2019s letter to shareholders, to understand the company\u2019s plans. This allows you to ask informed questions and even offer suggestions based on your understanding. Additionally, know the key personnel in the company and read about previous interns\u2019 experiences. Attend the company\u2019s presentation carefully and consult seniors who have interned in the role, as you might be asked about the specifics of the role. Lastly, soft skills are vital. Ensure you speak confidently, conduct yourself professionally, and present yourself well.\n\n4) When did you start preparing for this role and according to you what is the ideal time for aspirants to begin their preparation?\n\nA) I began preparing for this role passively at the beginning of my third year in August 2022, and more actively in January 2023 when I decided to pursue the CFA and FRM certifications.\n\nThe ideal time to start preparation varies for each individual. However, if you have no prior experience in finance or related domains such as quantitative analysis, consulting, strategy, product management, or data analysis, I recommend allocating at least a year to build a strong foundation from scratch. This timeline allows you to gain the necessary knowledge and skills gradually, ensuring a thorough understanding and solid preparation. If you are someone who\u2019s already been preparing for Finance for a while, I would suggest not deviating for the sake of doing \u201cextras\u201d because your batchmates are doing it. Focus on what you have been doing, and try to achieve mastery at it.\n\n5) What difficulties did you face while preparing for this Company/Profile? How did you overcome them?\n\nA) At the start of my third year, my CV was practically devoid of any finance-related experiences, aside from my Financial Engineering specialization. Additionally, my CGPA wasn\u2019t stellar, and I lacked positions of responsibility (PORs). Building a finance-oriented CV seemed like an ordeal!\n\nTo address these challenges, I first focused on improving my CGPA, raising it from 8.42 to 8.73. I then pursued courses and projects in finance, completed an equity research internship during the winter break, and secured a research internship at the Haas School of Business, UC Berkeley. The aim was to populate my CV with as many finance-related experiences as possible to increase my chances of getting shortlisted.\n\nFurthermore, I took the CFA Level 1 and FRM Part 1 exams in May 2023 and by God\u2019s Grace, successfully cleared both, which significantly strengthened my CV. I also sought advice from seniors to streamline my preparation and benefit from their experiences.\n\n6) Are there any specific requirements such as department, CGPA, or other criteria for this position? Additionally, do certain PORs or EAAs enhance one\u2019s chances of securing this internship?\n\nA) While there isn\u2019t any specific deal breaker on paper, being in Financial Engineering or Economics can be advantageous. Having a CGPA above 8.5 is beneficial, although a CGPA above 8 can suffice. Nomura is unlikely to reject you if your financial knowledge is exceptional, even if your CGPA is around 8.01.\n\nPORs used to be highly crucial, but my experience suggests that they are not indispensable. PORs can help if they provide relevant discussion points during the interview, but their absence can be compensated by finance-related internships, projects, or certifications.\n\n7) According to you, who should ideally apply for this job?\n\nA) Ultimately, if I may, it all comes down to professing your love for the realm of finance. Those who should ideally apply for this job are individuals who have a genuine passion for finance. Don\u2019t treat it as a second, or a backup option. Understand the core concepts deeply \u2014 not just to clear interviews, but to satisfy your intellectual curiosity. Stay updated with the latest market trends and economic developments, engage in thoughtful discussions, and reflect on how finance shapes the world around us. When you truly love what you do, your enthusiasm and knowledge will naturally shine through in the interviews. This authentic connection with the field sets you apart, and interviewers will notice it.\n\nI have seen people with impressive credentials \u2014 CFA or FRM certifications, numerous projects on complex finance topics, and internships at prestigious investment banks \u2014 fail to secure offers because they lacked a genuine love for finance. If you believe you have a true passion for finance and aspire to work in a firm where fundamental conceptual clarity is valued over professional accolades, then you should apply for this job.\n\n8) Kindly attach your CV/Resume. What are some of the major points you think would be valid to mention in your CV while targeting this profile?\n\nA) As previously mentioned, aim to populate your CV with as many finance-related experiences as possible. These experiences don\u2019t necessarily have to be strictly finance-related; they can encompass a range of fields such as quant projects, data science, or corporate strategy internships. Participating in competitions \u2014 whether in trading, equity research, quant hackathons, or M&A-related events \u2014 can also be valuable additions to your CV and serve as excellent discussion points during interviews.\n\n9) Lastly, what advice would you like to give to the students aiming to grab CDC internships this year?\n\nA) If all of this seems daunting, I want to reassure you that many tend to over-hype finance interviews. It\u2019s not as intimidating as it may appear. I\u2019ve heard exaggerated tales of interviews lasting for hours, with candidates being scrutinized to the smallest detail on their CVs. However, my experience was quite the opposite. I found my interviews enjoyable and enlightening. I learned a lot from my interviewers, and the process felt more like a constructive conversation than an interrogation.\n\nI understand the stress you\u2019re feeling. We\u2019ve all been there. I went into the process with doubts, but once I got through the initial rounds, my confidence soared, and I found myself enjoying the interviews. One of my interviewers, who is now my boss at Nomura, imparted valuable knowledge and made the experience incredibly rewarding. And remember, this advice applies broadly to other profiles as well.\n\nIn conclusion, don\u2019t let the CDC process consume you. It\u2019s an important phase in your college life, but it doesn\u2019t define your worth. Keep perspective and don\u2019t put your life on hold for it. With that said, I wish you the best of luck, may you excel in your endeavors, and may God bless you!"

        "content": "FORESIGHT(2024) : Internship at Texas Instruments | Avi Saraf |\n\n--\n\nListen\n\n1)Brief introduction and description of offered role\n\nHi Fellas! I am Avi Saraf, a 3rd year undergraduate student of Electrical Engineering. I am currently doing my Summer Internship at Texas Instruments, as an Analog Engineering Intern. I am passionate about hands-on Electronics. I am also excited about the transformation andchanging face of mobility in India.\n\n2) How did you get into Texas Instruments ? What was the selection procedure?\n\nThe selection procedure is fairly simple, unlike other companies, which generally involve multiple rounds.\n\nFor TI, after the CV submission, there was a written test based on the roles one has applied for. The test was conducted on 17 July 2023. It consisted of 3 sections \u2014 Aptitude, Analog, and Digital (since I had applied for Analog and Digital profiles). After shortlisting, a technical interview was conducted on Day 2.\n\nTI had offered 4 profiles \u2014 Analog, Digital, Signal Processing, and Embedded. One can apply for at most 2 of them.\n\n3) How to prepare for them?\n\nIt is essential to focus on getting your fundamentals right. The companies do not expect the students to know about advanced jargon but certainly gauge your interest in the domain and clarity in fundamental concepts.TI Analog interviews often revolve around RC circuits \u2014 covering concepts such as transient response, steady-state response, frequency response, feedback, op-amps (sometimes), amplifiers, etc. You may be asked to sketch a circuit and estimate voltages/ currents at any given node/ branch. As the interview progresses, the complexity of the circuit may increase -depending on your responses to the questions. You may refer to Himanshu Agarwal\u2019s playlist to practice RC-circuit interview questions. For Dual degree students, the interviews generally are much more rigorous and exhaustive.\n\n4) When did you start preparing for this role and according to you, what is the ideal time for aspirants to begin their preparation?\n\nWhile I had started approaching seniors in the Spring semester to get an idea about the roles and selection procedures, I started my preparation only in May 2023.\n\nFor digital \u2014 the course contents are not sufficient, and it is expected that students have familiarity with Static Timing Analysis (STA), Hardware description language (eg- Verilog), CMOS logic, and basics of Computer Architecture (a 3rd Year course). You may refer to Prof. Onur Mutlu\u2019s lectures/ slides for Computer Architecture, and Prof. ISG\u2019s NPTEL for Verilog.\n\n5) What difficulties did you face while preparing for this Company/Profile? How did you overcome them?\n\nI faced some difficulties in keeping a consistent schedule during the vacations since I had other involvements, too. I wanted to cover basics of Power Electronics, for which I did not get sufficient time. However, I prepared short notes for new concepts and revised them before tests. I solved some PYQs from tests conducted in previous years to understand the pattern of questions.\n\n6) Are there any specific requirements such as department, CGPA, or other criteria for this position? Additionally, do certain PORs or EAAs enhance one\u2019s chances of securing this internship?\n\nTI is open for circuital departments EE and ECE for all roles. It is open for CSE, MnC, and ISE for select roles. TI does not have a very high CGPS cutoff and does not attach too much importance to your CGPA. A decent CGPA of 8+ should be fine, although it is not rigid. PORs are not considered, but if you have done any projects, it may help during the interview.\n\n7) According to you, who should ideally apply for this job?\n\nIf you are among the ones who are still soul-searching to find out which profiles you are made for \u2014 worry not, for there are many more like you! An internship is a good opportunity to get first- hand exposure to working in the industry in a role you are passionate about. Remember to be open-minded and explore new domains. TI is a very dynamic organisation having the largest markets in Analog products \u2014 which power everyday devices you see around. If you\u2019re excited by what the semiconductor industry offers and are passionate about electronics, you should consider applying for TI.\n\n8) Kindly attach your CV/Resume. What are some of the major points you think would be valid to mention in CV while targeting this profile?\n\nTI does not focus too much on the CV. However, mentioning any projects you have done in Electronics or related areas would be good. Ensure you are familiar with the project details and have basic working knowledge if it comes up for discussion in the interview.\n\nIf you have done any good projects and are passionate, feel free to mention it in the interview \u2014 that would surely make a mark! The interviewers are senior engineers at TI, from domains such as Data Converters (ADC, DAC, etc.), Power Products (Converters, Gate drivers, etc), RF, Audio, etc in Analog. For Digital \u2014 TI has various teams working on Memory, transceivers, microprocessors, etc. It is always good to strike a conversation in the interview so that the panel can get to know you better.\n\n9) Lastly, what advice would you like to give to the students aiming to grab CDC internships this year?\n\n1. Try getting familiarised with the Industry: Attending PPT will give you a glimpse of the products at the company. When you start appreciating the scale at which the semiconductor industry operates and how it enables the world all around us \u2014 you will certainly develop a keen interest. For example \u2014 I spoke at length about the semiconductor crisis of 2022\u201323 (which greatly affected the automotive and consumer electronics industries) about my views during my interview.\n\n2. Make sure to gave good grasp over fundamentals: If you have a good grasp over fundamentals, you are equipped to handle any challenge that maybe given to you. For all roles, basic working knowledge will be required in Signals &amp; Systems, Microelectronics, Digital Electronics, and Control Systems (basic understanding of feedback).\n\n3. Believe in yourself: The internship selection process may feel intimidating at first, but it is important to keep going and have faith in yourself. There\u2019s lots to learn and each one of you will have charted a unique path. Finally, feel free to get in touch in case of any queries (Contact no. \u2014 9051386495).Good Luck!Avi Saraf"

        "info": "Practice problems from Leetcode, Codeforces, GeeksforGeeks, etc or whatever platform you are comfortable with and can keep InterviewBit for the last 1\u20132 months as it consists of just the right set of questions one requires before the assessments.",
        "content": "Foresight(2024) : Internship at Microsoft | Ayushi |\n\n--\n\nListen\n\nHello everyone, I am Ayushi, a pre-final year undergrad at IIT Kharagpur enrolled in its B. Tech course of Instrumentation Engineering. I am a boarder of Mother Teresa Hall of Residence and I shall be joining Microsoft India as a Software Engineering Intern this summer.\n\n2) How did you get into Microsoft? What was the selection procedure?\n\nI got into Microsoft through the Career Development Centre, IIT Kharagpur. The process consisted of an online assessment (in mid-July) and two rounds of interviews (on Day 1) -\n\na. Online Assessment -\n\nThe online assessment was held on Codility and was about an hour long. It consisted of two coding questions of medium-hard difficulty. From what I remember, the first question was to find out the longest symmetric substring from a string of (<,>,?) and the second question required us to use Union-Find. One needed to solve both the coding questions correctly to get through.\n\nb. Technical Round -\n\nWell, this was quite an experience as we were allotted our panels at around 4:30 in the morning. So do keep your sleep schedule flexible to help in times like these. The interviews were held online at Nalanda. In my interview, I was asked the standard \u2018Trapping Rain Water\u2019 problem. Initially, I had to give the brute force approach and then optimize it to satisfy the time constraints provided by the interviewer. The key here was to consistently communicate with your interviewer and keep them informed of your thinking process. They can be quite friendly and can help you find the way out if you are stuck somewhere.\n\nc. Technical+HR round -\n\nSoon, after my first interview ended, I got a call for my next interview. The process was similar here. I was asked a question on trees and I was required to present my solution, starting with the brute force approach and ultimately arriving at the most optimized version. For the HR part, the interviewer asked me to briefly describe the project that I found most intriguing. The interview lasted for approximately 45 minutes.\n\n3) How to prepare for them?\n\nFor the coding round, I would suggest starting with DSA as early as possible. Practice problems from Leetcode, Codeforces, GeeksforGeeks, etc or whatever platform you are comfortable with and can keep InterviewBit for the last 1\u20132 months as it consists of just the right set of questions one requires before the assessments. Participate in CF contests regularly and make it a point to upsolve the questions otherwise it won\u2019t help. (Also you can participate in the contests held by Grimoire of Code as they consist of some quality questions)\n\nFor the interview round, one must be thorough with your CV as the interviewer might ask questions about any point they find interesting. You must remain calm and composed throughout the entire process. Even if you are stuck somewhere, there is no need to panic. Communicating with the interviewer can be very helpful in ultimately finding your way to the final answer.\n\n4) When did you start preparing for this role and according to you what is the ideal time for aspirants to begin their preparation?\n\nIf anyone is aiming for a technical role in CDC, having a thorough knowledge of DSA is essential. I started learning DSA in my second year. To be honest, balancing DSA with your acads is challenging, and there were times when I had to focus solely on academics. However, if you manage your time effectively and are able to learn even one concept in a week, even that is sufficient. Taking small steps is what truly matters.\n\n5) What difficulties did you face while preparing for this Company/Profile? How did you overcome them?\n\nThe major issue I faced during my preparation was finding a clear roadmap with all the necessary resources in one place. There are a plethora of resources available online but choosing from them efficiently is a big task. Talking to seniors who prepared for the same profile last year is the best thing one can do in such situations. Moreover, It was tough to stay motivated and follow the same routine consistently for three months but having a group of friends to discuss doubts and share daily progress made the preparation journey much easier.\n\n6) Are there any specific requirements such as department, CGPA, or other criteria for this position? Additionally, do certain PORs or EAAs enhance one\u2019s chances of securing this internship?\n\nFor an SDE role, positions of responsibility (PORs) don\u2019t really matter, though they do enhance your CV overall. However, for CDC internships, a higher CGPA can significantly improve your chances of being shortlisted, in addition to your programming skills. Some companies even have a CGPA cutoff in their online assessments, so having a higher CGPA is always advantageous.\n\n7) According to you, who should ideally apply for this job?\n\nAnyone who loves problem-solving, enjoys coding and is interested in development can apply for this internship role.\n\n8) Kindly attach your CV/Resume. What are some of the major points you think would be valid to mention in CV while targeting this profile?\n\nIncluding good projects or previous internships in your CV can always be the starting point of discussion with your interviewer. They might simply ask you to skim through one of your projects. Present your work well in your CV and make sure to bolden the key aspects. Be confident in whatever you mention as not being able to explain your own project details can create a really bad impression on the interviewer. For software roles, listing your contest ratings can also be a distinguishing factor.\n\n9) Lastly, what advice would you like to give to the students aiming to grab CDC internships this year?\n\nMy main piece of advice would be to make use of these three months wisely. It is all about time management and putting in your efforts consistently. Don\u2019t hesitate to contact your seniors who have gone through the same process last year. They might be the best ones to guide you both on the professional and the personal front. The intern season is both hectic and confusing and might lead you to question your own abilities at times. But remember that if you have put in your time and efforts dedicatedly in the process, it is definitely going to pay off in the end. So just focus on giving your best every time. All the best!!"

        "content": "--\n\nListen\n\n1) Brief introduction and description of offered role\n\nI am N Anushka, a 3rd-year undergraduate student from the Department of Electronics and Electrical Communication Engineering at IIT Kharagpur. In the 2023 CDC Internship Drive I got an Internship offer from Adobe Research.\n\n2) How did you get into Adobe? What was the selection procedure?\n\nThe selection process for Adobe Research consisted of one online test and one round of interview. Online Test: The online test was held on HackerRank and was around one and a half hours long. It had two parts: The first contained a total of 18 MCQs, which had questions from data structures like stack, queue, linked list, tree, etc. The second section contained two coding questions (which were of an easy to medium difficulty). You needed to solve both coding questions correctly and perform well in MCQs in order to get through. Interview Round: There was only one round of interview, which was around 20 minutes long in my case. I was asked a few questions on linear algebra which I had mentioned in my resume as my coursework. They also asked about my knowledge in graphs. Majority of the interview was spent on discussing a project I put in my resume (It was a project on machine learning). You can expect questions from Data Structures and Algorithms, Linear Algebra, Probability and Statistics. The interview was mainly on CV grilling. Being thorough with your CV is a must. Having some projects on ML will be very beneficial for the interview round.\n\n3 )How to prepare for them?\n\nFor Coding Test Round: Learning data structures and algorithms and practising DSA questions from LeetCode. In the last month to get the idea about interview questions you can practise questions on InterviewBit. For Interview Round: During the interview, try to be calm and composed and answer the questions honestly and confidently. Also, prepare a nice introduction beforehand to start well. You should be very well prepared about all the points, especially the projects you put in your resume. It\u2019s better to avoid putting the things you are less confident about, as there may be cross-questions about anything they find interesting. Having good technical projects is always desirable, as it boosts your chances. A good project related to NLP or Computer Vision would enhance your resume considerably for this profile, as most of the projects in Adobe Research are related to these fields.\n\n4) When did you start preparing for this role and according to you what is the ideal time for aspirants to begin their preparation?\n\nI started preparation during the summer break. Starting your preparation in May is not too late. You just have to be diligent and keep a timeline so that you can finish it before the tests start as then you will not be having much time.\n\n5)What difficulties did you face while preparing for this Company/Profile?\n\nHow did you overcome them? As I was preparing for both Software and Core profile, there were too many things to prepare. To overcome this, I asked for advice from some of my friends and seniors which really helped me strategically plan my preparation, and working on it consistently throughout the summers helped me prepare well for the Internship process. I would advise, whenever you are having some difficulty regarding the preparation try to talk to your seniors or your batchmates who are also aiming for the same profile this will really help you overcome that problem.\n\n7) According to you, who should ideally apply for this job?\n\nAnyone who has a keen interest in the field of NLP or Computer Vision, and wants to innovate something in this field should apply for this internship.\n\n8) Kindly attach your CV/Resume. What are some of the major points you think would be valid to mention in CV while targeting this profile?\n\nFor this profile the most important part of the CV is the Projects and Internships section. Try to present your projects very well, as having 1\u20132 nice projects related to the profile will definitely increase your chances of selection. As you would be asked many questions related to your projects, prepare well for whatever you write in your CV.\n\n9) Lastly, what advice would you like to give to the students aiming to grab CDC internships this year?\n\nDon\u2019t be stressed at a time like this. Give your best and enjoy the outcome. All the best for your journey!!!"

        "content": "Foresight(2024)\u00a0: Internship at BCG | Aorkodeep Mandal |\n\n--\n\nListen\n\n1)Brief introduction and description of the offered role\n\nHi everyone, I am Aorkodeep Mandal, a 4th-year Undergraduate student in the Department of Electrical Engineering with a Masters in Financial Engineering. I am a Placement Committee Member at CDC, IIT Kharagpur. I have interned with organizations like McMaster University, Columbia Business School, and The StartupLab. On campus, I have also taken up leadership roles at E-Cell, Finance Club, HJB Hall, and ShARE.\n\nI have been offered an Internship at The Boston Consulting Group (BCG) for the summer of 2024. This is a Front Office Management Consulting role where the selected candidate joins as a Summer Associate.\n\n2)How did you get into Boston Consulting Group? What was the selection procedure?\n\nThe selection process had 3 primary steps.CV ShortlistingBuddy RoundsCase Interviews.\n\nCV Shortlisting: In my opinion, this is the most important step. From a pool of over 1000 applicants, only a handful (12 to 20) candidates make it through. The CV for Consulting is unique and needs thorough preparation.\n\nBuddy Rounds: Once you make it through the CV Shortlisting, you are allotted 2 buddies. This is consistent across all the Consulting Firms that hire through CDC with the number varying between 1 and 2. Buddies help you out with queries that you may have before the interviews ranging from Case Prep to workplace info., expectations, and specifics.\n\nCase Interviews: Depending on the firm, you might be subjected to 1 to 3 rounds of interviews. The general hierarchy of rounds is Consultant Round, Project Lead (PL) Round, and Partner or MDP Round. Depending on the firm, these rounds can either be eliminatory or cumulatively graded.\n\n3)How to prepare for them?\n\nCV Prep:\n\nA Consulting Firm divides your CV into segments and looks for \u201cSpikes\u201d. Make sure to cover as many spikes as possible in the components mentioned.\n\nAcademic Spike: Having a good CGPA and academic track record is expected. In addition to that, scholarships, grants, paper publications, top-notch departmental rank, and DepC are pointers to be covered to have a spike in this section.\n\nWork-Ex Spike: Impact is honey to the ears of Consult. Having a decent track of internships/projects in brand corporates, reputed foreign universities, or work-ex in an impactful or relevant role leading to social good is appreciated.PORs Spike: Leadership positions on campus, such as VP, Placecomm, Institute Representatives, flagbearers of Cells and Fests, governing batch at a major society or club, etc. add towards this spike.Extra-Curricular Activities: This is an often neglected yet fairly important metric for consulting firms. National/International achievements, social work, entrepreneurial experience, etc. are often judging criteria.Competitions/Awards: Brand Competitions such as Inter IIT, Hult Prize, competitions conducted by brand corporates, GC, etc are important for a spike in this section.\n\nIt is important to keep a few more pointers in mind. Make the CV impact-driven, start with impact words, and use numbers to justify this whenever necessary. A \u201cSTAR\u201d approach often works well. Since all you have is a 1 pager CV to cover as many spikes as possible, it is optimal to focus on cumulatively maximizing the number of spikes rather than over-stretching on a single sector. Get your CV reviewed by as many relevant people as you can and keep upgrading your drafts.\n\nBuddy Rounds:\n\nBuddy rounds are non-evaluative and have the sole purpose of preparing you for D-Day. Maximize the help you can extract from your buddies, with cases, sample answers to typical interview questions, and seek regular feedback. Although buddies generally do not decide your selection/rejection outcome, it is always helpful to be very well prepared before you form an impression in front of them. You should have prepared an ample number of cases with your case group (here, case group refers to the friend circle that practices cases with you) to be super confident before the chit-chat.\n\nInterview Rounds:\n\nCase Prep and a grip on the general HR questions will set you sail. These are the things to cover: Guesstimates, Cases - Profitability, Growth, Market Entry, Pricing, and Unconventional. Although M&A cases are not asked at an intern level, 1-2 cases in that domain won\u2019t hurt.\n\nThese are some of the resources to follow:\n\nGuesstimates: The Guessing Game by Communique, IIT KGP.Cases: Day One (IITM), Case Interviews Cracked (IITB), IIMA Casebook, etc.Playlists to follow: Case Interviews Cracked IIT B, Victor Cheng - Look Over My Shoulder\n\nHR Prep: A good introduction expressing the person that you are and a few standard questions showing your grit and interest towards the role and alignment with the company.\n\n4)When did you start preparing for this role and according to you what is the ideal time for aspirants to begin their preparation?\n\nAs discussed, there are 2 elements to it: CV Prep and Case Prep.\n\nYour CV is a culmination of your college life experiences, so, there\u2019s no ideal time to start. However, if you are planning to start now, the best time to start is yesterday :)\n\nWell, talking about Case Prep, 40 - 45 days before the interview rounds should be fine if you put in diligent efforts daily.\n\n5)What difficulties did you face while preparing for this Company/Profile? How did you overcome them?\n\nCase rounds are communication-heavy, which means, that even while you\u2019re thinking through the case or structuring your thoughts, it is necessary to keep the communication flowing with your interviewer. At times, I felt overwhelmed with my thoughts that maintaining the communication stream felt distracting, however, as you practice more, you get a sense of working this out.\n\nTo take your case in the right direction, it is important to ask relevant questions in a structured manner. Structuring cases are ad hoc and there\u2019s always a guilt of asking stuff at a later stage if they should have been covered earlier. However, again, the simple funda of life applies here, the more you practice, the drill to be on point gets better every time.\n\n6)Are there any specific requirements such as department, CGPA, or other criteria for this position? Additionally, do certain PORs or EAAs enhance one\u2019s chances of securing this internship?\n\nThe best part about this role is that it is open to all the departments without bias, however, a decent enough CGPA is expected. Also, as mentioned earlier, PORs with good enough exposure to managerial and authoritative work add a spike. Exceptional achievements in EAAs are a plus point.\n\n7)According to you, who should ideally apply for this job?\n\nIn my opinion, people who love to solve problems, work in teams, have demonstrated effective leadership, and are ready to withstand hours of work are ideal for this role. Also, as this role demands a lot of travel and dynamic shifts, someone who is adaptable to changes should have a good deal with this role.\n\nHowever, this is one of the best job roles to have at this level where you get to explore different industries and work with top-tier management at such an early age. Therefore, I recommend\n\neveryone to give this a shot and get hands-on experience, helping them decide their career path.\n\n8)What are some of the major points you think would be valid to mention in your CV while targeting this profile?\n\nAs discussed earlier, a well-crafted CV is quite important for this role. It should be a good fit with your Brand Internships, Achievements, PORs, Competitions, Extracurriculars, etc.\n\n9)Lastly, what advice would you like to give to the students aiming to grab CDC internships this year?\n\nFor the Junta preparing for CDC Internships, it is better to keep yourself hedged. Prepare for at least 2 profiles if your profile has a limited scope of opportunity, for ex. Consult and Finance.The best part about this journey is the people you encounter. Relax buddy, everyone has their ups and downs during this phase. It is quite important to have friends who are reliable, comforting, and at the same time, push you to be the best version of yourself. Make sure that you speak to as many relevant seniors as possible. End of the day, you can not control the variables that are not in your hand, and trust me, there are a lot of these variables. What you can do is focus on your prep and make yourself an asset.\n\nWith that, wishing you all the best for CDC Internships!"

As for my involvements on campus, I was a CDC Departmental Representative and a Student Placement Coordinator at the Career Development Centre. I am from Hyderabad, Telangana.\n\nI received an internship offer from Procter and Gamble (P&G) in the product supply role for the summer of 2024 and I am currently interning with them at their Mandideep plant.\n\n2) How did you get into Procter & Gamble ?

Reviewing P&G\u2019s principles and values on their website would be beneficial. During the group discussion round, situational questions prompt candidates to draw from their past experiences, including positions of responsibility, projects and internships. Responding to these questions in a structured manner, aligning with P&G\u2019s values would be helpful. In the interview phase, questions typically revolve around projects listed in your CV. This stage presents an excellent opportunity to express your enthusiasm for joining the firm and engage the interviewer by asking questions about the firm.\n\n4) When did you start preparing for this role and according to you what is the ideal time for aspirants to begin their preparation?\n\nThere isn't a specific preparation strategy for the FMCG profile. However, revising fundamental concepts of your core engineering discipline for a couple of weeks before the process starts can prove advantageous. Familiarity with supply chain management basics can be beneficial.\n\n5) What difficulties did you face while preparing for this Company/Profile? How did you overcome them?\n\nThe selection process for FMCG roles varies across companies. For instance, P&G prioritizes cultural alignment and the candidate\u2019s ability in situation assessment and decision-making. But the process is different in case of HUL, ITC. Personally engaging with seniors who have interned or secured positions in FMCG firms proved to be a valuable resource for me.\n\n6) Are there any specific requirements such as department, CGPA, or other criteria for this position? Additionally, do certain PORs or EAAs enhance one's chances of securing this internship?\n\nAt P&G, the department of the candidate is not a determining factor, and individuals from various departments have successfully made it through the selection process. While a strong CGPA is advantageous, it's evident from the shortlist that it's not the sole criterion considered. P&G values candidates with well-rounded CVs, emphasizing not only academic excellence but also involvement in extracurricular activities and campus engagement. Additionally, possessing managerial experiences on campus is highly regarded, as the company seeks individuals capable of eventually managing production lines.\n\n7) According to you, who should ideally apply for this job?The Product Supply position at P&G offers a wide-ranging scope, focusing on innovation-driven optimization efforts. The candidates would be given a deep understanding of industry intricacies to devise solutions for diverse challenges. It suits individuals who enjoy tackling large-scale problems.\n\n8) What are some of the major points you think would be valid to mention in CV while targeting this profile?\n\nMentioning positions of responsibilities on campus and extracurricular activities would be helpful as students with good managerial experiences and diverse skills are preferred. Also mentioning projects related to supply chain and utilization of optimization techniques would give an upper hand.\n\n9) Lastly, what advice would you like to give to the students aiming to grab CDC internships this year?\n\nI recommend gaining a clear understanding of your preferred profile and ensuring you have a backup option is a must. Given the lengthy and hectic process, maintaining composure and patience is crucial. Regularly seek guidance from seniors who have experienced similar situations and pursued similar career paths, as their advice can prove invaluable at every stage. Remember, securing an internship offer is just one milestone in your journey at KGP, so it's not worth excessively stressing over. Wishing you best of luck for the drive, I hope your efforts pay off!!"

        "content": "FORESIGHT(2024) : Internship at Goldman Sachs | Birru Lavanya |\n\n--\n\n1\n\nListen\n\n1)Brief introduction and description of the offered role.\n\nHey all. I am Birru Lavanya, a pre-final undergraduate student in economics at IIT Kharagpur. I am from Warangal, Telangana. I will be interning at the Controllers division of Goldman Sachs this summer.\n\n2)How did you get into Goldman Sachs? What was the selection procedure\n\nGoldman Sachs offers two roles at our campus, quant and software, and is open to all departments with no CGPA cutoff. The selection procedure consisted of an online test at first. The online test had four sections:1) A few questions on probability, maths and puzzles.2) 2 subjective HR questions. It\u2019s mostly the same every year.3) Two coding questions with medium-hard difficulty.4) Questions on CS fundamentals.A day before day one, candidates were shortlisted for offline interviews at Nalanda based on their test performance. I was shortlisted for quant interviews. There were three rounds of interviews. The first round started with a brief introduction, CV grilling and a few questions on probability, puzzles and some basic coding questions.\n\nAfter performing well in the first round, I was immediately sent to the second round, where I was asked probability questions, puzzles and coding questions. This round consisted of many follow-up questions for each question. Through careful analysis and brainstorming, I could answer each of them and impress the interviewer. The third was with the manager, who started grilling my CV and caught his eye on my econometrics project. He gave me a situation where I had to design the experiment and perform statistical tests. With a lot of communication, I convinced him of my experiment.\n\nLater, he moved to a coding question of medium-hard difficulty. All the rounds were interactive and engaging. I had three back-to-back interviews within a combined 2 hours. I was not asked to code anything explicitly, but I had to explain the logic and direction. There was no HR round as such for me. Immediately, I was told I was selected.\n\n3)How to prepare for them?\n\nFor probability and puzzles, I followed the standard interview books. Heard on the street, 50 challenging problems in probablity, brainstellar (it\u2019s a website :)), etc. (I am adding this line because my Grammarly suggested it. I heard on the street that there were 50 challenging problems in probability, brainstellar, etc. lol).\n\nFor DSA, I enrolled in Algozenith in my fourth semester and practised some leetcode questions. I didn\u2019t participate in any coding competitions as such, but I recommend doing so to get acquainted with the test environment.\n\n4)When did you start preparing for this role and according to you what is the ideal time for aspirants to begin their preparation?\n\nI didn\u2019t specifically target this company. I was a mentee in Quantitative Research at JP Morgan. Towards the end of the mentorship, I was given an opportunity to interview for an internship (I wasn\u2019t selected). Resources were provided, and they were the same for any standard quant role interviews. (Here, I can say that I got those from the interviewers themselves :D). I started preparing three months before the on-campus tests and interviews. I recommend preparing at least three months before the CDC internship process starts. But it\u2019s never too late and never too early. I also recommend practising coding and participating in various coding competitions as early as in 2nd year.\n\n5)What difficulties did you face while preparing for this Company/Profile? How did you overcome them?\n\nThe difficulties I encountered during my preparation were mainly the need for more time and overwhelming resources to complete. I also had to attend classes and do assignments as a part of JP Morgan\u2019s mentorship. We also had to do a case study for about a week at the end, which wasgetting in the way of my preparation.\n\n6)Are there any specific requirements such as department, CGPA, or other criteria for this position? Additionally, do certain PORs or EAAs enhance one\u2019s chances of securing this internship?\n\nThere are no specific requirements, such as department, CGPA, or other factors, for this position. Additionally, PORs and EAA would not enhance the chances of being selected since I had neither PORs nor EAA. They might help take the interview forward, but anyone would not be rejected based on PORs and EAA.\n\n7)According to you, who should ideally apply for this job?\n\nAnyone interested in finance, problem-solving or software development is ideal for this job. You will be selected for a software or quant role based on the test performance and interviews.\n\n8)What are some of the major points you think would be valid to mention in CV while targeting this profile?\n\n9)Lastly, what advice would you like to give to the students aiming to grab CDC internships this year?\n\nFeel free to reach out to me anytime :)\n\nCarpe dium!"

        "content": "FORESIGHT(2024)\u00a0: Internship at Graviton Research Capital LLP | Swapnil Yasasvi |\n\n--\n\nListen\n\n1) Brief introduction and description of offered role\n\nHi, I am Swapnil Yasasvi, a fourth-year undergraduate from the Department of Computer Science and Engineering. I will be joining Graviton Research Capital LLP this summer as a Software Engineer Intern.\n\n2) How did you get into Graviton Research Capital LLP? What was the selection procedure?\n\nAs a participant in the CDC Internship Program facilitated by the placement cell at IIT Kharagpur, I applied for the Software Engineer position offered by Graviton during the on-campus recruitment drive. Graviton provided two roles: Software Engineer and Quantitative Researcher, with a restriction to choose only one.\n\nThe selection process comprised a DSA-based test on Hackerearth, featuring two medium-hard questions. Candidates who completed both questions proceeded to the interview rounds.\n\nThe initial interview round included questions on probability and statistics, alongside a hard dynamic programming-based DSA question with some invariance observation.\n\nThe second round involved solving a puzzle and delving into computer fundamentals such as operating systems and computer architecture.\n\nDuring the HR round, I faced typical HR inquiries like why I was interested in joining Graviton, narrating my journey, and outlining my future aspirations. Since I hadn\u2019t specifically prepared for HR questions, I provided spontaneous responses. Towards the conclusion of the HR round, they extended the offer to me.\n\nUltimately, Graviton selected two candidates for the Software Engineer role and one for the Quantitative Researcher position. I was fortunate to be chosen for the Software Engineer position.\n\n3) How to prepare for them?\n\nIn the lead-up to the CDC internship process, I noticed that Dynamic Programming (DP), Graphs, Trees, and Segment Trees were repeatedly asked in the tests. I diligently worked through the entire CSES problem set for these topics, also went through the AtCoder DP contest, and sought out problems on Codeforces (CF) and AtCoder to solve.\n\nThe three months right before the CDC internship process kicks off are super important. If you use them right and plan meticulously you can get good results. In May, I dived into solving DP and graph problems on CF with ratings above 1700, along with Algozenith.Whenever I needed to get the hang of new concepts, I often referred to USACO and cp-algorithms. In June, I dedicated my time to practicing problems on AlgoZenith and LeetCode, with a keen focus on DP, Graphs, Trees, and Segment Trees. Additionally, I tackled problems covering important topics such as string algorithms, Trie, and two-pointers. For linked lists, I primarily practiced from Interviewbit. Furthermore, I started revising Operating Systems using class slides and engaged in solving easy-medium Brainstellar problems.\n\nIn July, I focused on revising CS core like OOPs, Computer Architecture, and Computer Networks through class slides. Additionally, I also started working on problems from the GOC CDC series.\n\n4) When did you start preparing for this role and according to you what is the ideal time for aspirants to begin their preparation?\n\nSo, my main goal was to land an SDE role, and Competitive Programming (CP) is crucial for acing the tests and securing interview opportunities. I\u2019ve been into CP since my second year, but if you\u2019re just starting and your CDC internships are coming up soon, focus on brushing up on your basics first. Spend a week or two on standard data structures/concepts like stacks, queues, priority queues, sets, multisets, and number theory topics like the sieve method, as well as DFS and BFS.\n\n5) What difficulties did you face while preparing for this Company/Profile? How did you overcome them?\n\nI didn\u2019t have many problems, but I was anxious about making mistakes because of the pressure. To stay calm and collected, I followed my friend\u2019s advice and took some deep breaths right before the interview. Also, it\u2019s crucial to talk to your interviewer. You shouldn\u2019t stay silent for too long without saying anything. I always made sure to share any ideas or small steps in a helpful direction with the interviewer.\n\n6) Are there any specific requirements such as department, CGPA, or other criteria for this position? Additionally, do certain PORs or EAAs enhance one\u2019s chances of securing this internship?\n\nYes, the department you belong to does matter, especially if you\u2019re from a circuital department, you might have a slight advantage. But even if you\u2019re not, you can still improve your Competitive Programming (CP) skills and Dev skills to increase your chances of getting an interview. Also, your CGPA is important. The higher it is, the better your chances, especially for companies like Quadeye and Glean, which shortlist based on CGPA alone.Positions of Responsibility (POR) don\u2019t matter much for Software Development Engineer (SDE) roles. 7) According to you, who should ideally apply for this job?\n\nIndividuals interested in a career combining software engineering and finance/quant should consider applying for a role at Graviton Research. The company offers a unique opportunity to work in both fields, using computer science to solve complex financial problems. If you have a passion for technology and a strong understanding of finance/quant, this could be an ideal position for you.\n\n8) What are some of the major points you think would be valid to mention in CV while targeting this profile?\n\nHFTs and many other Day1 companies often don\u2019t even glance at your resume before the interview. They might only check it when they\u2019re shortlisting candidates. During the interview itself, they\u2019ll ask questions related to the job and your skills, regardless of what\u2019s on your resume.\n\n9) Lastly, what advice would you like to give to the students aiming to grab CDC internships this year?\n\nThe CDC process, including preparations, tests, and interviews, can be mentally draining, leading to a loss of motivation. To overcome this, I recommend forming a study group to discuss problem-solving approaches and keep track of deadlines. It\u2019s also beneficial to maintain regular communication with peers to gauge your preparation progress. Taking assistance from seniors in reviewing your CV is essential, and don\u2019t hesitate to ask for their guidance.\n\nIt\u2019s crucial not to let demotivation affect you. Comparing your progress to that of others may discourage you, but it\u2019s important to stay positive, learn from your mistakes, and focus on improvement for future opportunities.\n\nWishing you all the best for your upcoming internship drive."

        "content": "FORESIGHT(2023): Summer Internship at DSP | Aditi Maurya |\n\n--\n\nListen\n\n1) Brief Introduction\n\nHello everyone!\n\nMy name is Aditi Maurya, a final year undergraduate from the Department of Chemistry, enrolled in its 5-year Integrated MSc course with micro-specialization in Artificial Intelligence. I have got an internship offer at DSP Asset Managers as a Quantitative Investments and Analyst.\n\n2) How did you get into DSP? What was the selection procedure?\n\nThe selection process was resume based followed by Technical and HR interviews. In technical interviews, they asked about my past projects, the architecture of language models (since it was mentioned in my CV), some basic financial concepts (only the ones mentioned in my resume, again), and my Kaggle competitions. Apart from the resume-based questions, they asked one guesstimate. The interview was too intense and the interviewer was putting pressure to check if I\u2019m confident in my answers. It went well.\n\nAfter the technical round, there was an HR round in which they asked basic HR questions along with some questions based on my major course ( why being in chemistry, going for a quant profile, etc.)\n\n3) How to prepare for them?\n\nMy advice for the students who are planning to appear in the DSP ( quant in general ) interview is that have a thorough understanding of the projects and competitions you have mentioned in your resume because they will dig deeper into your resume, can ask architecture of the models, the terms you have mentioned and like anything which is there in the CV, so be prepared.\n\nApart from that, have confidence in yourself and don\u2019t get afraid if the interviewer puts pressure on you, keep calm and answer confidently. Do practice guesstimates, probability and statistics, and quizzes for a safer side. In most of the quant profiles, guesstimates and statistics are asked.\n\n4) What difficulties did you face while preparing for this Company/Profile? How did you overcome this problem\n\nSince I was preparing for the quant profile (or data science profile) primarily, I practiced all the standard questions and was confident enough with my projects and competitions so, in general, I haven\u2019t faced any issues in particular, the only challenge was to handle the pressure during the interview as I have already told it was a bit intense.\n\n5) According to you, who should ideally apply for this job?\n\nMost people who are interested in finance and quantitative profile should prepare for this job because the kind of projects we are working on is based on pure finance along with financial and statistical modeling. Also, after getting selected, one has to give the exam of NISM Mutual Fund V-A to finish their internship. This is what they will tell you during the onboarding process.\n\n6) Any specific advice you want to give to the junta sitting for internships this year?\n\nRegardless of the company, start preparing for tests at least 3\u20134 months early and keep in touch with your friends to be on track. Solve standard questions from heard on the street, 50 challenging problems in probability, brain stellar, puzzles, and guesstimates. Go through previously asked questions of various companies. Try giving mock interviews parallelly, so that it gives you confidence and reduces anxiety before the actual interview. Keep your introduction ready and learn it by heart. Also, talk to seniors about the hiring process of specific companies you are targeting. Try to learn about the latest products or launches by the company you are applying for and the background of the company\u2019s foundation.\n\nOn the interview day, remain calm and keep yourself hydrated throughout the day as it will be hectic. Your mental toughness counts more than your technical skills during CDC season. Work hard smartly and handle the rejections positively, as it is a part of the process. Do never give up, Bounce back fast.\n\n7) What are some of the major points you think would be valid to mention in your CV while targeting this profile? (any specific suggestions you would like to make?)\n\nFor quant profiles in general, previous internships/projects, competitions, and strong analytical skills matter. Because of the relevant projects/internships, the interviewer gets something to talk about and you have an opportunity to make an impression. Adding competitions, especially the Kaggle competitions (if you have achieved some position) helps you to get an edge over other candidates. Try to avoid mentioning the basic Titanic Kaggle competition, I do not recommend it to anyone, try something different as there are ample competitions available. Positions of Responsibility (PORs) are not that important but look good if you have them.\n\nDo not write anything on your resume that you are not confident about. If you are mentioning any project/intern make sure you are very thorough with it. Even if you exaggerate anything, just ensure you can defend it well."

I received an internship offer from DSP Asset Managers as a Quantitative Investments and Analyst.\n\n2) How did you get into DSP? What was the selection procedure?\n\nThe selection process was resume based, followed by a Technical interview. The entire technical round went for about 40 mins. It started by asking me what DSP does and what an AMC (asset management company) does. Next, they selected an internship experience from my resume, which I had done at a FinTech startup. They told me to go through and explain the entire process of the work I had done during that internship. I explained everything in about 10 mins.\n\nDuring the interview, I faced tough questions about my methods and models. The interviewers wanted to know if there were better ways to approach the work I had done. They thoroughly examined my techniques and challenged me to consider alternative approaches that could potentially yield even better results.\n\nThey also asked me to explain a few basic ML algorithms from scratch, which is easy if you have done any course online or taken an MLFA course.\n\n3) How to prepare for them?\n\nMy advice for students preparing for DSP (or any quant/financial analyst role in general) is to be thorough with your resume. Having relevant internship experience/projects helps a lot in these profiles.\n\nBe ready with all the basic ML algorithms in case they ask to implement it from scratch. For this, you can follow any online resource like Andrew Ng on Coursera or Krish Naik\u2019s tutorials.\n\nTo excel in the aptitude section, reviewing fundamental concepts in probability and statistics is advisable.

Balancing a full-time internship from 9 to 6 left me with limited energy and little time to dedicate to interview preparation. Considering my priorities and the importance of thorough preparation, I left the internship to focus fully on CDC preparations. However, it may be a different case for someone else.\n\n5) According to you, who should ideally apply for this job?\n\nAnyone interested in finance and analytics can apply for this job. The project I am working on is making financial models and algorithms which help decide when/which stocks to buy/sell. If this kind of work interests you, then you can surely apply for it.\n\n6) Any specific advice you want to give to the junta sitting for internships this year?\n\nYou should start your preparations at least three months before the process. Create a study group with like-minded friends targeting similar profiles to stay on track and meet deadlines. Practice mock interviews with group members or seniors to refine your skills. You can stay motivated together, share resources, and provide valuable feedback to ensure success.\n\nMake your CV well before the deadline and have it reviewed by seniors and friends. In case of any doubts, never feel afraid to consult your seniors.\n\nBe well-versed with your introduction and some commonly asked questions. Read a bit about the company before the interview and talk to seniors who are placed there to know about the hiring process of some specific companies.\n\nOn the day of your interview, be ready well before the time to avoid last-minute panic. Be confident, and calm, and keep yourself well-hydrated throughout the day.\n\nFinally, embrace rejection as part of the process. Stay determined, trust the journey, and never lose hope. Success awaits. Best of luck!\n\n7)What are some of the major points you think would be valid to mention in your CV while targeting this profile? (any specific suggestions you would like to make?)\n\nHighlight any relevant internships/projects you have done that shows that you have worked on real-world projects and can work in a team.

I am glad to be able to help out fellow KGPians with what I have learned in the process .whilst securing an SDE intern at Amazon via the CDC procedure.\n\n2) How did you get into Amazon? What was the selection procedure?\n\nI would like to briefly outline my journey throughout the second year and how it has contributed. My interest in computer science topics led me to take various application-level courses in CSE and related departments. This gave me course projects with hands-on experience in core software projects. I had some exposure to web dev and data science via the general championship competitions. All these experiences helped me develop a solid background.\n\nAs far as the selection process goes, it included a coding round and an interview for me.

I was born and brought up in Jalandhar. Talking about my previous experience, I had a remote research intern at the University of Birmingham which was about a particular algorithm which was developed by the professor.\n\n2) How did you get into Honeywell? What was the selection procedure?\n\nHoneywell is open to all departments. The selection procedure was similar to most of the companies Firstly, there was an online test. It had 3 questions and were okayish level questions as far as I remember. Before Honeywell, I had one interview in DE Shaw in which I was rejected after my first round. In DE Shaw, I was asked about a medium-level coding question and after that, the person was more interested in CS fundamentals I told him that I was not comfortable with them, but he still asked me them and I tried to answer my best.\n\nFor Honeywell, After the test, we had 2 interviews. The first one was technical and the second was HR. Personally, my interview was pretty chill and they literally asked me nothing in the interviews. My technical interview was for just 5 mins in which I got the question of how could you reverse a string. Probably the person taking the interview was not from a coding background. So, after that, I was asked about very basic concepts of OOPS and it was just that. But note that it wasn\u2019t the case for everyone. Many of my friends had interview for more than half an hour.\n\n3) How to prepare for them?\n\nIn my case, no preparation was needed!

So, for preparation, I would say that it all depends on how much time are you having. I will tell you all the possible preparation which you could consider depending on the time you are having.\n\n2\u20133 Months: Focus on DSA. Try to do problems on websites like GFG, interview bit, leetcode\n\n3\u20136 Months: So, it depends on you if you are having this much time. So, if you are interested in quant, you probably need to devote some(very small) time towards it. You will also need to focus on Competitive programming as it might be helpful for the coding rounds of some companies.\n\n6\u201312 Months: You are having a lot of time. I will advise that you should really try to get involved in competitive programming and try to increase your ratings. It will eventually help you out at some point.\n\n4) What difficulties did you face while preparing for this Company/Profile? How did you overcome this problem\n\nThe problem which most people face is getting confused about what to prepare and where to prepare from as there are a lot of resources. I would suggest focusing on a single resource and getting a grip on the topic in general.\n\n5) According to you, who should ideally apply for this job?\n\nAnyone who is interested in a software development role should apply\n\n6) Any specific advice you want to give to the junta sitting for internships this year?\n\nMy only advice is just to try your best and try to learn more and more things and don\u2019t worry about the output that your hard work or preparation is going to have. Just be in the process, enjoy learning it and try to be your best self because you are never going to have that much time in your life again for this preparation."

        "content": "FORESIGHT(2023): Summer Internship at AWL Inc. | Manav Nitin Kapadnis |\n\n--\n\nListen\n\n1) Brief Introduction\n\nGreetings, my name is Manav Nitin Kapadnis. I am a fourth-year Dual Degree undergraduate student studying Electrical Engineering at the Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur. This summer, I will be interning at AWL Inc. as an AI Engineer. I have gained valuable experience through previous internships with renowned institutions like University College London, University of Alberta, Rutgers University, and Massachusetts Institute of Technology. My research interests focus on the practical applications of Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing, particularly in the areas of Natural Language Processing, Graph Machine Learning, Representation Learning, and Multi-Modal Learning.\n\n2) How did you get into AWL? What was the selection procedure?\n\nI joined AWL Inc., a Japanese Deeptech startup specializing in Computer Vision and Deep Learning-based video analytics solutions, as an AI Engineer Intern. The selection process involved the following steps:\n\nResume Selection Round:\n\nTo progress to the next stage, it was crucial to have a strong background in Deep Learning and Machine Learning, supported by a few notable projects. While there was no specific CGPA cutoff, having a CGPA above 8 and an impressive resume significantly increased the chances of moving forward. Alternatively, even with an average CV, a CGPA above 9 provided a favorable opportunity.\n\nCoding, Aptitude, and Data Science MCQ Round:\n\nThis round lasted approximately 1.5 hours and included a mix of two coding questions, around 10\u201315 multiple-choice questions related to Data Science, focusing on probability, statistics, computer vision, and deep learning. Additionally, there were MCQs assessing knowledge of Data Structures and Algorithms. Qualifying this round was essential to proceed to the final interview round.\n\nFinal Interview Round:\n\nThe interview round primarily revolved around discussing the projects and internships mentioned in the resume. The interviewers delved into the details of representative internships or projects, seeking explanations about the motivation behind them, encountered challenges, and how they were overcome. Furthermore, a case-study test was conducted, where I was asked to provide solutions to a problem the company was facing with their current product. This round typically lasted around 30 minutes, emphasizing the need to present one\u2019s best project for discussion, as it played a significant role in shaping the final decision.\n\n3) How to prepare for them?\n\nI had mainly prepared for Data Roles in CDC. To prepare for the selection process, I followed a structured approach focusing on specific areas:\n\nData Structures and Algorithms (DSA):\n\nI solved a variety of coding problems from InterviewBit, ensuring I covered the majority of the practice questions. In the weeks leading up to the selection process, I revised the challenging questions to reinforce my understanding. Although DSA wasn\u2019t my primary focus, I made sure to cover the essential concepts necessary for success.\n\nMachine Learning (ML):\n\nI found Krish Naik\u2019s YouTube playlist on Complete Machine Learning to be an excellent resource for gaining in-depth knowledge of various ML algorithms. This playlist also provided coding examples to understand and implement the algorithms from scratch. Additionally, I discovered the StatQuest YouTube channel, which offers easy-to-follow explanations of fundamental concepts. This channel also has a playlist specifically covering Probability, which was helpful for strengthening my understanding. For practice questions, I utilized Analytics Vidya\u2019s top N questions for ML and Data Science interviews.\n\nProbability and Statistics (Prob Stats):\n\nI had previously taken a course on Probability and Statistics (MA20104), which provided a theoretical foundation. Alternatively, I recommend the Stat 110 course offered by Harvard University, which is available for free on Edx or YouTube. For practice, I used assignments from Stat 110 and questions from the book \u201cFifty Challenging Problems in Probability.\u201d If additional practice was needed, I referred to InterviewBit\u2019s DS and ML practice questions.\n\nCV Preparation:\n\nFor each section of my CV (projects, internships, positions of responsibility), I created a comprehensive list of potential interview questions and prepared answers in advance. I found it helpful to make concise notes for each heading, which I could quickly review the day before the interview.\n\nPlease refer to the following link for a Google Doc containing a collection of resources I used for preparation: [Resource Doc Link:\n\nhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/1YqjIMPHBfa_ioSsoaKN9R79xsUKQD3aIlIGo5SUGX_0/e dit]\n\n4) What difficulties did you face while preparing for this Company/Profile? How did you overcome this problem?\n\nDifficulties faced and tips to overcome them:\n\n- Comprehensive Data Topics: Data encompasses a wide range of topics, making it challenging to brush up and revise everything just a day before the interview. To overcome this difficulty, I maintained a Notion board or a similar tool to track the topics I had covered and those that still needed review. This helped me stay organized and focused during my preparation, ensuring I covered all essential areas over time.\n\n- Balancing CDC Preparation and Internship Work: I faced the difficulty of managing my CDC preparation alongside the responsibilities of my internship, particularly when I was visiting Canada. To address this challenge, I recommend starting the preparation process from mid-May if you are interning during the summer before CDC. Alternatively, if you have one month before the CDC process begins (typically in July), it is still feasible to prepare effectively, provided you have already been practicing Competitive Programming (CP) during the previous semester. Efficient time management and prioritization are key to maintaining a balance between internship work and CDC preparation.\n\n- Finding Practice Questions for ML Case Studies: I encountered difficulty in finding sufficient practice questions specifically focused on ML case studies. To overcome this challenge, I relied on reputable platforms such as Analytics Vidya, Interviewbit, and MLExpert. These platforms offer a wide range of questions that help build a strong conceptual and practical understanding of the concepts required for data roles. Exploring their resources and regularly practicing with their case study problems can enhance your preparation for ML-related interviews.\n\nBy implementing these tips, you can navigate the difficulties faced during the preparation process and optimize your chances of success in the selection process.\n\n5) According to you, who should ideally apply for this job?\n\nIdeally, individuals who have a genuine interest in the field of Machine Learning and Data Science should apply for this job. If you have a passion for Data Science and are seeking an opportunity to work in a fast-paced international startup environment, AWL Inc. would be the ideal place for you.\n\n6) Any specific advice you want to give to the junta sitting for internships this year?\n\n- Research Companies: Take the time to research and understand the companies you are interested in. Explore their products, services, and values to ensure they align with your career goals and interests.\n\n- Build a Strong Resume: Tailor your resume to highlight relevant skills, experiences, and projects. Focus on showcasing your achievements and the impact you made in previous roles or academic projects.\n\n- Practice Interview Skills: Brush up on common interview questions and practice your responses. Be prepared to discuss your experiences, projects, and technical knowledge. Mock interviews or interview preparation workshops can be helpful.\n\n- Stay Positive and Persistent: The internship application process can be competitive, and rejections are common. Stay positive, learn from each experience, and keep trying. Persistence is key to finding the right opportunity\n\n- Seek Guidance: Reach out to mentors, professors, or career counsellors for guidance and support throughout the application process. They can provide valuable insights and advice to help you succeed."

What was the selection procedure?\n\nQualcomm came on day-3 of CDC internship drive. The selection procedure was very straightforward. A test followed by a couple of interview rounds. The test contained 2 sections, aptitude and profile-specific. I applied for the Machine Learning profile. Aptitude section was not very difficult. In the Machine Learning section, there were some C/C++ questions and ML-DL algorithm based questions. There were two interview rounds: Technical and HR. Technical round was mostly CV based. There were some basic DSA questions and puzzles too.\n\n3) How to prepare for them?\n\nTo prepare for this profile in Qualcomm, one must be thorough with the basics: Data Structures and Algorithms and Machine Learning algorithms. Prob-stats usually help in any Data oriented profile and it is a must if you\u2019re targeting it. Solve standard puzzles and probability questions from books like 50 Challenging Problems and Heard on the Street etc. For ML-DL, Andrew NG courses are mostly sufficient. It\u2019s important to have a few good projects in ML as most of the questions in your interview are from your CV.\n\n4) What difficulties did you face while preparing for this Company/Profile? How did you overcome this problem?\n\nI had some difficulties in my technical interview. The interviewer started asking me some difficult CP level questions which I was not very comfortable with. I gently told him that my knowledge in DSA was limited and my core interest was in deep learning. So he started grilling me on ML/DL and python coding. I was able to answer most of the questions there. It\u2019s a good practice to be honest with the interviewer rather than wasting his time.\n\n5) According to you, who should ideally apply for this job?\n\nThough this role says Machine Learning intern, the work is mostly on the inference and development side. It\u2019s an ideal role for someone with interest in different ML frameworks like PyTorch, Tensorflow etc.\n\n6) Any specific advice you want to give to the junta sitting for internships this year.\n\nOne of the most important advice for people sitting in CDC: Be honest with your interviewer, try to interact. If you have doubts or confusions, ask. You\u2019re not expected to have all the knowledge. You should show your ability to learn anything very quickly."

        "content": "FORESIGHT(2023): Summer Internship at Qube Research & Technologies | Ashutosh Ghuge |\n\n--\n\nListen\n\n1) Brief Introduction\n\nHey everyone! I am Ashutosh Ghuge, a third year undergraduate student pursuing Instrumentation Engineering at IIT Kharagpur. As for my campus involvements, I was the Governor of Encore. I did my summer internship at Qube Research & Technologies, Mumbai, as a Quantitative Research Intern.\n\n2) How did you get into QRT? What was the selection procedure?\n\nIt was the first time QRT visited IIT Kharagpur, and other IITs as well, for internships last year. It was a Day 3 company. It offered two profiles Quantitative Researcher and Quantitative Technologist, and I had applied for both as I was primarily targeting Quant and SDE.\n\nThe company shortlisted around 15 people for the interviews. There was no preliminary test, so the shortlisting was mostly based on department (Circuitual + Economics) and CGPA. There were three rounds of interviews.\n\nThe first round started off with a casual conversation about my interests in Machine Learning, followed by a few questions on the methods and evaluation metrics of Regression. The second round was a follow-up on the topics discussed in the first round, some basic problems to test my coding skills, and a brief discussion about a project on my CV. The final round was supposed to be an HR round but was more of a semi-technical round where a mix of HR and Machine Learning questions were asked.\n\n3) How do I prepare for them?\n\nFor the Quantitative Research profile, a good grip on Machine Learning concepts would help, as the majority of the interview was based on that. This website (https://machinelearningmastery.com/) has a very exhaustive collection of blogs on almost all topics in machine learning and could be used as a good source for brushing up concepts.\n\nApart from this, from a general Quant preparation point of view, having a sound knowledge of probability and statistics will go a long way.\n\n(A few resources to exploit: 50 Challenging Problems in Probability, BrainStellar(website), Heard on the Street)\n\nHaving finance knowledge or prior experience in the same is not a necessity, nevertheless it will definitely give you an edge.\n\n4) What difficulties did you face while preparing for this Company/Profile? How did you overcome this problem?\n\nAs I mentioned earlier, QRT visited campuses for the first time for internships, so my preparation was not very company specific. I was primarily targeting SDE roles at first, but during my preparation I was inclined towards quant roles as well. While preparing for SDE roles, I used to spend hours doing DSA prep, which would get highly monotonous after a point, so brushing up on probability and doing a few brain teasers would strike a good balance. Thus, in my experience, preparing for SDE and Quant roles went quite hand-in-hand.\n\n5) According to you, who should ideally apply for this job?\n\nGenerally, quant companies do not have a very strong bias towards people with prior experience with finance, so do not hold back from applying for such roles if you aren\u2019t very well versed with finance jargon (neither was I). If you are looking for a job where you constantly have to kindle your brain and love to play around with statistics, this is definitely the place for you.\n\nThe application of deep learning in finance and quantitative trading is getting increasingly popular, so if you\u2019ve got a knack for it, feel welcome!\n\n6) Any specific advice you want to give to the junta sitting for internships this year.\n\nWell, CDC internships is quite an interesting phase. There will be times when you\u2019ll be questioning your life choices and wondering if you even like the field you are preparing for. Worry not; you are not alone! As good and attractive as a PPO is, internships are primarily meant for you to explore the industry a little and make clearer life choices ahead. So, as they say, it very much isn\u2019t the \u201cend of the road\u201d. Off-campus holds a ton of far better opportunities. It does come at the cost of a tad bit more struggle, however I\u2019ve seen people get the best out there.\n\nPrep as much as you can, target at least two profiles so that you have better chances, and trust your preparation. It\u2019ll be quite the roller-coaster so do not forget to have fun! All the best, y\u2019all!\n\n7) What are some of the major points you think would be valid to mention in your CV while targeting this profile?\n\nIt is good to have a few projects/internships and coursework regarding Machine Learning on your CV. Apart from this, some software development experience will also add value, especially for the Quantitative Technologist role.\n\nAs I mentioned earlier, finance experience is not a necessity; however, if you have any, do highlight it."

        "content": "FORESIGHT(2023): Summer Internship at Cisco | Gaurav Madkaikar |\n\n--\n\nListen\n\nBrief Introduction\n\nHey everyone! I\u2019m Gaurav Madkaikar, a final-year dual degree student from the Computer Science and Engineering Department. I received an opportunity to intern at Cisco via the CDC Internship Drive held last year, in 2022.\n\nHow did you get into Cisco? What was the selection procedure?\n\nThe selection procedure included an online screening test followed by three interview rounds\u2013 two technical rounds and an HR round.\n\nOnline test:\n\nThe test consisted of roughly 40 MCQs based on various CS concepts like OOPs, operating systems, computer networks and two coding questions. There was no negative marking for the MCQs. Both coding questions were based on graphs, with the first being an implementation of Floyd Warshall and the second having a DP-based solution. I solved the first one entirely and the second one partially and was shortlisted for the interviews.\n\nRound 1: After a brief introduction, the interviewer gave me a standard sliding window question which I explained and coded quickly. He then asked me multiple questions on OOPs\u2013 virtual functions, copy constructors, and singletons, to name a few. Given that I had mentioned OS and CN in my course curriculum, he went on to ask a lot of questions about these topics. Since I had already covered these topics in detail in my sixth semester, I was in a good position to answer all of them. He ended with an implementation question based on binary trees. The interview extended to an hour, and I was quickly called in for the second round.\n\nRound 2: The interviewer was a senior manager who asked me to share any previous project experiences and any challenges I faced. We then had a detailed discussion about the projects mentioned in my CV. The interview ended with me asking some questions about his experience in the company.\n\nHR Round: This was a very short round of roughly 10\u201315 minutes. He was pretty chill and enquired about my interactions in the previous rounds, following up with some standard HR questions like, why do you want to join Cisco, where I see myself in 5 years\u2019 time. The round ended with a discussion about the stipend and my preference for the work location.\n\nHow to prepare for them?\n\nIn general, you need to be thorough with your DSA problem solving skills for any software related position. Keep reading about the various algorithms through articles on geeksforgeeks and cp-algorithms.com (specially for graphs). Practicing them regularly via leetcode/interviewbit would help. I, personally, covered certain bookmarked questions on leetcode and focussed on solving interviewbit completely. I also gave contests conducted by Grimoire of Code(GOC), which helped me get a feel of what the CDC tests would look like. Although I didn\u2019t focus much on CP, I did have friends who gave contests on CF regularly, but I would recommend it only after you have covered considerable ground.\n\nApart from DSA, having knowledge of CS topics like OOPs/OS/DBMS/CN (descending order of importance) is always a bonus, especially OOPs is a must. These topics can be looked upon from learncpp.com (OOPs), geeksforgeeks and the corresponding course slides from the CS department. Make sure to check out previous interview experiences, the type of questions asked and some basic general knowledge corresponding to the company you\u2019d be interviewed for.\n\nWhat difficulties did you face while preparing for this company/profile? How did you overcome this problem?\n\nFrom my personal experience, I would suggest everyone not be overwhelmed with the amount of resources available for preparation. Choose your resources at the start and stick with them until completion before moving on to something else. Put a heavy focus on improving DSA, as it is the most important factor in getting interview shortlists. Other topics (like OOPs, OS) can be easily revised in the weeks closer to the tests/interviews. Focus on solving questions rather than just reading theory/code. In my case, I noted down those concepts/problems which were non-trivial and revised them at the end. Specifically, for this company, I expected questions from networks and OS and thus revised it the day before. Keeping contact with friends and family will surely help in calming down the stress levels as the tests approach.\n\nAccording to you, who should ideally apply for this job?\n\nAnyone who is interested in problem-solving, enjoys programming and is keen on developing software whilst aspiring for the best work-life balance can apply to Cisco. Any specific advice you wantto give to the junta sitting for internships this year The CDC phase will be challenging, competitive yet fun in its own manner. Try to target one or two profiles and prepare accordingly instead of applying to all. The earlier you start your preparation, the better it is. Get insights from seniors/friends who have gone through the process and prepare a resume that truly reflects your skills. DSA is the most important factor in getting interview shortlists, so put your maximum time and effort into mastering it. Try to give mock interviews in parallel so that you get used to the formal setting.\n\nDuring interviews, be confident and let your interviewer know about your thought process. Start with brute force and then proceed towards the optimal one. If you are stuck at any point, ask the interviewer for clarification and explain your current approach. Interviews can get really tiring, so make sure you sleep well and are hydrated throughout. Handling rejections is as important as any skill in your resume, so don\u2019t be disheartened and hope to give your best for the next opportunity. Believe in yourself, and the good days aren\u2019t far ahead!\n\nWhat are some ofthe major points you think would be valid to mention in your CV while targeting this profile? (any specific suggestions you would like to make)\n\nHaving good projects or previous internships on your CV help in initiating discussions around programming with your interviewer. They also indicate your ability to learn and develop on the go. You can create your own projects and/or collaborate with your friends and build projects over a common course or an idea. Highlight the most important features of your project and write them down as full statements. Try to fill out your CV as much as possible with the relevant information. Showcasing your performance in competitive programming, competitions will certainly stand out. While mentioning a POR for the software profile is not that important, it can help in giving your CV an all-around perspective. Refrain from mentioning anything you are not confident about, prepare your CV thoroughly and be ready to be grilled on anything mentioned."

I am from Ranchi, Jharkhand. I will be joining Honeywell as a software engineering intern from May\u201823.\n\nHow did you get into Honeywell(SWE)? What was the selection procedure?This role was open for all the pre-final students from all the departments. The screening test consisted of three coding questions with moderate difficulty levels. The test was conducted on the Hackerank platform.Question 1: It was on Graph Traversal, where we were presented with an undirected graph with N nodes and M edges and had to calculate the Connected Sum of each component and finally come to the final answer.Question 2: It was on Segment Tress, but O(n 2 ) approach passed all the test cases because of its weak nature. In this, we have given two arrays, one of which stores the indices of the items in the order they are placed in the queue, and the other stores the instantaneous position where the corresponding item is placed in the queue. It was mentioned that each time an item is inserted, all the following items are shifted toward the right by one position, and finally, we need need to find out the sequence of the item in the queue after all the items have been placed.Question 3: It was based on a map and some operations of it; I do not remember it exactly :)After the shortlisting based on CV and test, the next step involved a technical interview followed by an HR round. The technical round has some questions on sorting algorithms (as my project was a sorting visualizer), a couple of short coding questions followed by some basics on the OOPs concepts, and a brief discussion on all the projects I had mentioned in my CV and finally discussed all the technical expertise mentioned in my CV. The last round was the HR round, where standard HR questions like past experiences, what difference you can make if selected,and how you are a team player. HR would be particularly interested in extracurricular activities, your ability to express yourself, and, most significantly, whether or not you share the company\u2019s values. Going through the firm\u2019s page and checking out the current working domain of the organization is highly recommended for the HR round, as HR would want you to have some understanding of the company to which you are applying. Examine the company\u2019s values aswell.\n\nHow to prepare for them?\n\nTo prepare specifically for Honeywell, you should have an excellent grasp of Data Structures and Algorithms. There will be medium questions on the test, so clear all of the principles of conventional DSA, and concentrate more on Dynamic programming and graphs, as these topics are included in practically every company\u2019s test. In terms of coding examinations, you should solve questions for at least two months to gain a firm grasp. You could practice questions on sites such as Leetcode, InterviewBit, and GFG because the questions will be pretty similar. I personally used the AlgoZenith platform and InterviewBit mostly to solve the question.You should be familiar with the projects listed on your interview CV. Maintain your composure and avoid panicking throughout the interview. Never code in an interview as if you know everything about the problem; instead, try to interact with the interviewer, ask questions, and if you don\u2019t have any, tell him what you\u2019re doing to solve the problem and why you\u2019re doing it; only then will the interviewer be interested in you; ask for hints if you\u2019re stuck anywhere; the interviewer is there to help you; they just want to check your thought process. To prepare for the behavioral questions in the HR round, you should be familiar with the STAR (situation, task, action, and result) technique and look over the company\u2019s Leadership principles.\n\nWhat difficulties did you face while preparing for this Company/Profile? How did you overcome this problem?\n\nThe most challenging issue I encountered was thinking about the question with its optimal response in a certain period during the screening exam while under pressure to do better than others. To overcome this, you can give mock tests before the CDC test begins. Technical interviews are not the same as competitive programming. In interviews, you must gradually workyour way up to the most effective answer while being unaware of the limits. However, the limits determine the entire approach and mentality in a programming competition. Being a CP man might cause some issues during interviews. Occasionally not directly looking at the limitationsshould be sufficient to circumvent this difficulty.\n\nWhile studying for CDC, you may suffer rejections in coding exams, mainly due to CGPA on Day 1 or Day 2. During this time, you must be psychologically intense and trust in yourself.\n\nAccording to you, who should ideally apply for this job?\n\nAnyone interested in developing software, coding, or handling extensive data, in general, can apply for this role.

        "content": "FORESIGHT(2023): Summer Internship at American Express | Omkar Modi |\n\n--\n\nListen\n\nBrief Introduction\n\nHello everyone, embarking on my journey towards securing an internship at Amex (American Express) was a defining moment in my career. In this blog post, I will share my experience, detailing the selection procedure, preparation strategies, and overcoming challenges. Additionally, I will provide valuable advice for aspiring interns and highlight key points to consider while targeting this prestigious company.\n\nI am Omkar Modi, a 4th-year dual degree student from the Department of Electrical Engineering at IIT Kharagpur, with a current CGPA of 9.19 at the end of my 8th semester. I have delved into the fascinating world of machine learning and data science, exploring many opportunities. From engaging in research projects and implementing ML and Statistical models during corporate internships to participating in Data Science hackathons, I have been fortunate to gain invaluable experiences that have significantly enhanced my skills. Throughout this journey, I have come to understand the vital importance of balancing both knowledge and experience, recognizing that they are inseparable components for success, especially in the realm of Machine Learning enthusiasts like myself.\n\nHow did you get into Amex? What was the selection procedure?\n\nThe journey of securing an internship at Amex was both challenging and rewarding. The selection procedure comprised a test round followed by an interview round, which allowed me to showcase my skills and qualifications. Let\u2019s delve into the details of the selection procedure that led to my successful internship at Amex.\n\nThe application process began with a test round consisting of three sections: Quant, Machine Learning, and Business Case Study. The Quant section was compulsory, and I had the option to choose between the Machine Learning and Business Case Study questions. The Quant section, with its 20 aptitude questions, presented challenges involving puzzles and data inference based on pie charts and other plots. It required me to think critically and apply my quantitative skills effectively. Despite the difficulty, I managed to complete all the questions within the given time frame of 30 minutes. The Machine Learning and Case Study sections, on the other hand, were relatively easier. The Business Case Study was particularly intriguing, with a pool of about 130 unlockable questions covering various aspects of business such as marketing and financing. Selecting the right set of questions to answer a specific business question required a thorough understanding of the subject matter.\n\nUpon successfully clearing the test round, I advanced to the interview round. The first round of the interview involved a discussion with a senior manager from the marketing team, boasting 7\u20138 years of experience. During this round, the interviewer extensively examined my CV and asked questions based on its content. The questions assessed my knowledge, skills, and compatibility with Amex\u2019s values and objectives. I was also asked to articulate my motivation for wanting to join Amex. The interviewer\u2019s friendly demeanor created a comfortable environment for the conversation. It\u2019s worth mentioning that some of my friends who went through the interview process were presented with puzzles to solve during this round.\n\nFortunately, after successfully navigating the selection process, I received the news that I had secured the internship at Amex. Looking back, I attribute my success to being confident and well-prepared during the interview rounds. Attending the Amex presentation helped me gain a deeper understanding of the company, enabling me to answer questions more effectively.\n\nFor anyone aspiring to join Amex, my advice is to approach the interview rounds with confidence and be well-prepared. Take advantage of attending pre placement Amex presentations or gather information about the company beforehand. Understanding Amex\u2019s business model and demonstrating a genuine motivation to contribute to the company\u2019s success can significantly enhance your chances of securing an internship.\n\nHow to prepare for them?\n\nPreparing for an internship at Amex requires a focused and comprehensive approach. To excel in the selection process and increase your chances of securing the internship, consider the following strategies:\n\n1. Showcase Projects and Internships:\n\nProjects and internships play a significant role in the CV shortlisting process and form the basis for interview questions. Make sure to highlight relevant projects and internships on your CV, emphasizing the skills and experiences gained from them. Be prepared to discuss the results, challenges faced, and lessons learned during these endeavors. By showcasing your practical experiences, you demonstrate your ability to apply theoretical knowledge to real-world scenarios.\n\n2. Quantitative Aptitude and Probability Practice:\n\nTo excel in the quantitative aptitude section of the test round, regular practice is essential. Dedicate time to develop a strong understanding of probability and statistics, as these concepts are often tested. I gathered notes from my probability and statistics class and also concise notes from Stats110. Good knowledge of conditional probability, distributions, and expectations was required for ML interviews and tests. The Brainsteller website offers a curated collection of questions and puzzles in probability and related fields. Regularly practice solving problems from this platform to sharpen your quantitative aptitude, improve problem-solving skills, and deepen your understanding of probability concepts. Additionally, consider resources such as \u201c50 Challenging Problems in Probability\u201d by Frederick Mosteller for more challenging problem-solving practice.\n\n3. Master Machine Learning Concepts:\n\nProficiency in machine learning is highly valuable in today\u2019s data-driven world. Take the initiative to deepen your understanding of machine learning concepts, as it may be relevant to the internship position at Amex. Completing Andrew Ng\u2019s Machine Learning course is an excellent starting point for gaining foundational knowledge in the field. For studying statistical concepts I took help from the ML playlist by Krish Naik. Additionally, read blogs and articles on machine learning topics from reputable platforms such as Analytics Vidhya, Medium, and Towards Data Science. These resources provide insights, real-world applications, and the intuition behind ML algorithms, further enhancing your expertise.\n\n4. Strengthen Quantitative and Reasoning Abilities:\n\nDeveloping strong quantitative and reasoning abilities is crucial for success in finance-related roles. To enhance these skills, consider studying chapters 1 and 4 of \u201cHeard on the Street\u201d by Timothy Falcon Crack. These chapters cover probability and statistics topics and provide valuable practice questions and explanations. By working through these materials, you can improve your quantitative aptitude, reasoning abilities, and problem-solving techniques.\n\n5. Practice Data Interpretation and Inference:\n\nIn addition to probability, the ability to interpret data and make informed inferences is vital. Practice analyzing and drawing conclusions from charts, graphs, and other forms of data representation. This skill will come in handy during the test round and interview rounds, where you may encounter data-related questions. Strengthening your data interpretation skills will allow you to showcase your analytical abilities and make evidence-based decisions.\n\n6. Stay Updated and Engaged:\n\nKeep yourself informed about the latest industry trends, especially in the finance and technology sectors. Stay updated on advancements in data analytics, financial modeling, and relevant technologies. Engage in online forums, attend webinars, and participate in relevant communities to stay connected with professionals and gain insights into the industry. By staying actively engaged, you demonstrate your enthusiasm for the field and your commitment to ongoing learning and growth.\n\nRemember, preparation is key to success. Prioritize showcasing your projects and internships, practicing quantitative aptitude and probability, mastering machine learning concepts, and strengthening your quantitative and reasoning abilities. With a focused and comprehensive preparation strategy, you can position yourself as a strong candidate and increase your chances of securing an internship at Amex. Good luck!\n\nWhat difficulties did you face while preparing for this Company/Profile? How did you overcome this problem?\n\nWhile preparing for the Amex internship, I encountered a few challenges along the way. However, with perseverance and the right strategies, I was able to overcome these difficulties. Here are some of the challenges I faced and the steps I took to overcome them:\n\n1. Rigorous Selection Process:\n\nThe selection process at Amex is known for its rigor, which initially felt overwhelming. The competitive nature of the test round and the intense interviews posed a significant challenge. To overcome this, I focused on building a strong foundation of knowledge and skills in the relevant areas. I dedicated ample time to studying quantitative aptitude, probability, and machine learning concepts. Regular practice and solving a variety of problems helped me gain confidence and improved my problem-solving abilities.\n\n2. Managing Resources and Avoiding Confusion:\n\nI know by now you would have received a wealth of fundae from seniors and batchmates, causing confusion about what to prioritize. To overcome this, I strategically evaluated my strengths, researched the requirements of the Amex selection process, and created a personalized plan. I balanced coding skills, probabilities, and data analysis, integrating multiple resources. Regular self-assessment and adjustments ensured efficient use of time and increased confidence for the Amex challenges.\n\nThe interview rounds, particularly the intense CV grilling and the technical data problem statement, brought forth a new level of pressure. I felt the need to perform exceptionally well and effectively communicate my skills and experiences. To overcome this, I engaged in mock interviews with peers and sought feedback on my performance. I also conducted thorough research on Amex\u2019s business model, products, and services to confidently answer questions about the company. Practicing positive visualization, helped me remain calm and composed during the actual interviews.\n\n4. Staying Motivated:\n\nThe preparation process for such a highly sought-after internship can be demanding and prolonged, which can sometimes lead to a dip in motivation. To overcome this challenge, I set clear goals and reminded myself of the long-term benefits and the valuable learning opportunities the internship at Amex would provide. Seeking support from family, friends, and mentors also played a crucial role in keeping me motivated and focused on my preparations.\n\nAccording to you, who should ideally apply for this job?\n\nIn my opinion, individuals with a strong foundation in quantitative aptitude, data analysis, and problem-solving skills are ideally suited for the Amex internship. Candidates who have a passion for finance, technology, and data-driven decision-making will find the internship particularly rewarding. The ability to effectively communicate complex ideas, work well in teams, and demonstrate a drive for continuous learning and growth are also valued qualities at Amex.\n\nWhat are some of the major points you think would be valid to mention in your CV while targeting this profile?\n\nAs someone who has gone through the CDC process and experienced the pressure and uncertainty, I would like to offer some specific advice to candidates sitting for internships this year:\n\n1. Stay Calm and Confident: The CDC process can be overwhelming, and it\u2019s natural to feel anxious before interviews. However, it\u2019s crucial to remain calm and have confidence in your abilities. Keeping a calm mindset allows the interview process to flow smoothly, and self-confidence gives you the strength to perform at your best. Remember to trust in your preparation and believe in yourself.\n\n2. Don\u2019t Doubt Your Capabilities: If you don\u2019t get selected for a Day 1 or Week 1 internship, it does not define your skills or capabilities. The CDC process involves an element of luck, and there are numerous opportunities beyond the initial rounds. Keep in mind that every opportunity is a chance to showcase your potential, so give your best shot each time. Your dedication and effort matter more than the timing of the internship.\n\n3. Embrace the Learning Experience: Approach the internship search as an opportunity to learn and grow. Every interview, even if it doesn\u2019t result in an offer, provides valuable experience and feedback. Take note of areas for improvement and continue to develop your skills. The process itself is a valuable learning journey that can shape your future career path.\n\n4. Network and Seek Guidance: Engage with your seniors, mentors, and professionals in the industry. Seek advice, guidance, and insights from those who have been through similar experiences. Networking can provide valuable information about companies, interview strategies, and the industry as a whole. Don\u2019t hesitate to reach out to individuals who can offer support and share their knowledge.\n\n5. Persistence and Resilience: The internship search can be challenging, and setbacks may occur. However, it\u2019s important to remain persistent and resilient. Stay motivated and keep pushing forward, even in the face of rejections or delays. Your determination and ability to bounce back from setbacks will demonstrate your strength of character and resilience.\n\nRemember, the CDC process is just one part of your journey. It does not define your worth or potential. Focus on continuous improvement, maintain a positive mindset, and seize each opportunity with enthusiasm. Your hard work and dedication will ultimately lead you to the right internship opportunity and contribute to your personal and professional growth."

I am a fourth-year undergraduate student of the Department of Electrical Engineering enrolled in its Dual Degree program with a specialization in Machine Learning and Signal Processing. I will be joining Bajaj Auto as a summer intern in its R&D EEE Department for the summer of \u201823.\n\nHow did you get into Bajaj? What was the selection procedure?\n\nBajaj Auto came on Day 2 of the Internship drive and was opened for AE, ME, EE, EC and IM branches for CV submissions. After CV shortlisting, the selected candidates were invited for an MCQ test.\n\nThe MCQ Test consisted of 90 questions which had to be completed in a window of 90 minutes. The test comprised of 4 sections namely-\n\nThe shortlisted candidates were then invited for the interview rounds. There were 2 rounds- One Technical Round and one HR round.\n\nTechnical Round: Very Basic questions from Electrical circuits, Transient states were asked. Then, I had a project in my resume that used CNN to detect Covid-19 through cough samples. They asked me to explain the model architecture and subsequent questions followed where we discussed how we can deploy the project in real-time. This round typically lasted for around 20 minutes.\n\nHR Round: Thetion Technical Round was followed by an HR Round, where I was asked about my choice of MTech specialization. It was followed by a brief discussion on my projects and we again discussed how some of them can be improved and deployed to solve some of the existing challenges. Also, we had a small discussion regarding my PORs on campus. This lasted for another 20 minutes.\n\nAfter the HR round, within 15 minutes I was informed about my selection in Bajaj Auto.\n\nHow to prepare for them?\n\nFor the MCQ Test, English/comprehension questions are fairly intuitive and you don\u2019t need preparation for that. For Analytical and Statistical, knowledge of basic statistics, probability, Permutation and Combination is a must and you can practice additional questions from CAT's previous papers, solve puzzles from brainstellar.com and solve ample probability, analytical questions from the web.\n\nFor the technical questions, following the course curriculum of EE is enough. Special care must be given to studying some core EE courses like Power Electronics, Controls and Electrical Machines. Also, be thorough with the knowledge of Basic Electronics.\n\nQuestions asked are easy and don\u2019t involve lengthy calculations, having basic knowledge works for most cases.\n\nFor the interview rounds, be very thorough with your CV and you must be able to explain all your projects well. Confidence is key and they check your confidence and problem handling skills along with the generic technical skills.\n\nWhat difficulties did you face while preparing for this Company/Profile? How did you overcome this problem?\n\nThe MCQ test will require you to solve 90 questions in 90 minutes, so the test is heavily dependent on how quickly one can solve questions. If you are not thorough with the concepts, you won\u2019t be able to finish a considerable number of questions on time.\n\nSpend most time of your summer practicing analytical statistical questions as no matter which profile you sit for, these will come in handy. Additionally, revise all previous EE courses to perform well in the test.\n\nAccording to you, who should ideally apply for this job?\n\nStudents interested in core Electrical Engineering and having an interest in Automotive industry/ Electric Vehicles should apply for this internship.\n\nAny specific advice you want to give to the junta sitting for internships this year?\n\nWhat are some of the major points you think would be valid to mention in your CV while targeting this profile?\n\nHaving a project in the respective field often helps, but it\u2019s not a requirement. (I, personally, didn\u2019t have any core projects on my resume).\n\nHave a decent CG(preferably >8.00, it will be even better if >8.50).This should get you through most of the CG shortlisting.\n\nMention any coursework that you find relevant to the internship, this could be a great conversation starter if you don\u2019t have projects to mention in your CV."

        "content": "FORESIGHT(2023): Summer Internship at Bajaj | Venkata Sai Saran Grandhe |\n\n--\n\nListen\n\nIntroduction:\n\nHello everyone! I am Venkata Sai Saran Grandhe, a fourth-year undergraduate student ofthe Department of Mechanical Engineering. I am from Nehru Hall of Residence. For the last CDC session, I was focused on the core profile only, and I got my CDC internship in Bajaj for the research and development domain but then didn\u2019t take the internship because I got the research intern in France and I am currently doing that.\n\nHow did you get into Bajaj? What was the selection procedure?\n\nRegarding the selection process, first, there was a technical task which was total mechanical engineering questions which also included some syllabus from 3rd year by then I didn\u2019t complete my 3rd year but I just referred to some topics online by referring to some online synopsis but I wasn\u2019t that perfect on 3rd year so I totally focused on the mechanical topics of first year a little bit and 2nd year. So after the test, the people who are qualified in this test, so I don\u2019t know the criteria on which they shortlist us maybe a cut-off, after this there was a psychometric test, by this what I mean is they ask some real-life questions, eg;- what happens when you are leading a team and team members are not working how would you manage total things, how genuine are you, how you manage time, so these were the question asked and was roughly a 30\u201340 min test.\n\nI think there is no standard answer to this question; it\u2019s all about how genuine you are. So what I observed is, if you are trying to convince the examiner that you are a good guy then you will definitely miss some points in the first and last question, so my suggestion in this point is be yourself, don\u2019t try to impress the examiner.\n\nAfter this, there was a direct interview. The first round was the technical round, I was asked questions based on my project and academics and after this, I was shortlisted in the HR round, they asked my interest and why I wanted to pursue an internship in Bajaj and they discussed some points about how my work life would be and how my work would be as an intern.\n\nSo this is the brief process for the Bajaj intern.\n\nHow to prepare for them?\n\nOkay so, considering the online test was the initial core mechanical question so I had all my notes neatly written and organised so I just referred to my notes and it was kindly easy because I was the one writing them. In case anyone has not written notes, suppose we have much online material for GATE There is kind of short synopsis and important concepts, there is anyone doesn\u2019t have notes prepared they can use this, in my case I had notes written and for one or two topics I referred the online material. Many people plan to go through all the NPTEL lectures in each subject but this is a total waste of time because questions would be on the periphery level, and no one will ask you to derive. For this round, you don\u2019t need to stress more on the details. You just need to have a basic idea of what the chapter is, what are the different formulas and how you apply formulas.\n\nAnd for the interview round, one needs to be sure about the projects they have put in the CV from the point, even if the person has contributed, don\u2019t mention that you have done a total project in CV, mention the point you have done because the interviewer will surely see the bullet point and ask you questions. For example, my one project was a robotic arm, so I used a fibre mechanism so I mentioned that this is the work I was involved in. The interviewer asked for minute details of the project so I was able to explain. So when you are about to give the interview, be sure about every point of the project mentioned. And regarding the interview technical aspects the interviewer will ask you what are your courses in the curriculum the course you tell defines the question he gonna ask, he knows all the courses you have undergone in your last semester, which you should be mentioning in your CV, mention the 3 courses you are totally strong in order of strength because the first course you gonna mention will be the first question asked.\n\nFor these 3 or 2 courses I suggest everyone who is planning for core CDC go through every detail of these courses, even the derivation because even though it was not asked to me, it was asked to my friend to derive an equation. I would suggest that you have at least a structural idea of how things work in the courses you\u2019re gonna mention.\n\nWhat difficulties did you face while preparing for this Company/Profile? How did you overcome this problem?\n\nYeah so I want to specifically mention one point there is any person focusing on core CDC intern considering the number of opportunities and competition it is very difficult to ensure that person gets intern on the first day, maybe his friend from the same department who is focusing on software or data they will be getting intern on Day 1 or there would be more of the people getting intern in initial days. Bajaj was on the 2nd day so I had many friends from mechanical who were placed on Day 1. It was not for a longer duration but I felt I should have applied for these and I would be constantly comparing myself with my friend, so the thing is don\u2019t compare yourself with friends applying in other profiles so just be on your point and don\u2019t feel sad or don\u2019t feel disheartened when you didn\u2019t get selected\n\nOn Day 1 I got shortlisted into ITC but I was unable to make to the GD round so at that moment I was totally frustrated because I did not get the first company which selected me for the further round so just stay motivated and don\u2019t compare yourself with other, everyone life is unique and also preparation and also there is a small fraction of luck for CDC interview I don\u2019t say that it\u2019s totally luck but I would say 1% luck matter. Just be sure with your preparation and be confident. If you are confident you will definitely get one day or the other.\n\nAccording to you, who should ideally apply for this job?\n\nConsidering this automobile company, this company expects someone from mechanical who is totally motivated towards the core and who has a decent CGPA so at the time of applying I had a CGPA greater than 9 and I have heard that a CGPA greater than 8 or 8.5 is suitable for core interview because the company is looking for someone inclined towards mechanical and your CGPA reflects your academic, this is one the key aspects the company looks for so I think a decent CGPA is must, and considering the second aspect, they also need project inclined towards mechanical. These two are the main aspects regarding just profile.\n\nAny specific advice you want to give to the junta sitting for internships this year?\n\nI just want to add one point for the people who are focusing on core mechanical jobs, let the interviewer know how interested you are in working on the core side because you need to stand out from other people who are applying for this job by showing how motivated you are for working with machinery and how motivated you are in doing research it may be worth mentioning some point like in my case we didn\u2019t have IC engines when I was applying for the job, but in interview, I mentioned that I was highly fascinated that how engines worked and I studied some topics and I am free for questions in this way I expressed my interest that I want to stay in the core. I think this was the key factor that the interviewer selected because he saw the spark in me.\n\nThe second thing is even if there is someone who is interested but doesn\u2019t have enough project just contact your engineer because there would be a mechanical engineering design project which they can use in their CV and they can complete in a span of 10\u201315 days\n\nThe third piece of advice I wanna add is if someone is interested to apply in these jobs they should learn software related to mechanical engineering or some designing software like Solid work or some data analysis software because these are the tools you apply to analyse any mechanical engineering projects. If you already have skill in this it would be an additional thing the interviewer is going to look at and the probability of hiring you increases.\n\nWhat are some of the major points you think would be valid to mention in your CV while targeting this profile?\n\nAs I mentioned in the skills part add the software I just mentioned if you know about them and used them previously POR doesn\u2019t have that value in the case of core jobs but having the POR gives them the confidence that you are good in managing stuff on your own, you are good in leadership, try to include a POR but this is not mandatory like consultancy profile, but it is an add on to your CV.\n\nRegarding the courses you mention other than academic courses, suppose there are some CAD course and engineering simulation courses which you might have covered on other platforms, that would be attractive for the companies or there would be some computation course which you would have learnt from a YouTube playlist, you can mention that these are course or I have the basic idea. These all things will be sufficient.\n\nNote: Prepare your CV thoroughly before going to an interview."

        "content": "FORESIGHT(2023): Summer Internship at Nutanix | Nikhil Saraswat |\n\n--\n\nListen\n\nBrief Introduction:My name is Nikhil Saraswat, and I am currently pursuing my B.Tech in Computer Science and Engineering at IIT Kharagpur. I am a third-year undergraduate student.\n\nHow did you get into Nutanix? What was the selection procedure?I participated in the Internship season phase \u2013 1 by Career Development Center at IIT Kharagpur, and Nutanix visited on Day 1. I cleared the coding round and subsequent interviews and secured an internship at Nutanix.\n\nHow to prepare for them?I believe that one must focus on DSA (Data Structures and Algorithms) and prepare a good CV that highlights relevant projects and experiences. To prepare for DSA, one must practice problems based on various topics such as Graphs, Dynamic Programming, Binary Search, Two-Pointer, DSU, Trie, etc. It is also essential to develop soft skills. Specifically for Nutanix, they conduct a debugging round where they give you a Python code to debug and identify the bugs. In my interview, this round was merged with the technical round.\n\nWhat difficulties did you face while preparing for this Company/Profile? How did you overcome this problem?As I was preparing for the SDE (Software Development Engineer) profile, I faced challenges such as lack of confidence in weaker topics and time management. To overcome these, I joined an online course on DSA for placements and internships offered by AlgoZenith. I practiced a lot of problems on the platform and other coding platforms such as Codeforces, LeetCode, and InterviewBit. I also participated in coding contests on Codeforces and Codechef to improve my coding skills and handle pressure during coding rounds. To manage my time effectively, I allocated time for learning new concepts and problem-solving practice.\n\nAccording to you, who should ideally apply for this job?I believe that anyone who wants to secure a decent internship in the SDE profile should prepare and apply for this company.\n\nAny specific advice you want to give to the junta sitting for internships this year?My advice to anyone who wants to secure a decent internship in the SDE profile is to practice problems based on DSA, learn soft skills, and improve communication skills.\n\nWhat are some of the major points you think would be valid to mention in your CV while targeting this profile?(any specific suggestions you would like to make?)In a CV, it is important to include prior internships, experiences, and relevant projects. Ideally, one should limit it to 3-4 projects and highlight past achievements such as ranks in coding competitions and contests. It is also essential to format the CV in a fluent and professional language."

        "content": "FORESIGHT(2023): Summer Internship at Goldman Sachs | Vidushi Agarwal |\n\n--\n\nListen\n\n1) Brief Introduction\n\nHello, my name is Vidushi Agarwal. I am a pre-final year undergraduate student at IIT Kharagpur pursuing a Bachelor\u2019s degree in Electronics and Electrical Communication Engineering. I am interning at Goldman Sachs as a Summer Analyst in the Asset and Wealth Management division.\n\n2) How did you get into Goldman Sachs? What was the selection procedure?\n\nThe selection process consisted of one online round and two (for some it was three) interview rounds.\n\nThe online round consisted of 4 sections each with a specified time limit.\n\nThe first round of interview started with some CV grilling. As i was being interviewed for software profile the interviewer was interested in my projects and asked to explain one too. Afterwards he moved on to some basic linked list implementation questions where he even asked me to code it. The interview was quite interactive and engaging, and after it concluded, I was called back for the next round.\n\nThe second round started with ad-hoc questions, which I was expected to code on the spot. The interviewer then proceeded to add constraints to the problem, challenging my approach to the problem-solving process. The interviewer also posed a few puzzles, which I solved through brainstorming and careful analysis.\n\n3) How to prepare for them?\n\nTo excel in coding interviews, the first step is to master basic data structures and algorithms. Once you have a firm grasp of the fundamentals, you can strengthen your problem-solving skills and develop a fast thinking to crack the coding questions in the online test. I recommend practicing questions from popular platforms like GeeksforGeeks, LeetCode, and CSES. You can even go for questions module-wise on Algozenith too.\n\nAfter gaining proficiency in standard DSA questions, you can test your skills by participating in coding competitions on platforms like CodeChef and Codeforces.\n\nAlso I would strongly recommend participating in various coding competitions, as this can have a positive impact on your CV. Additionally, it is crucial to practice dynamic programming, graphs, and trees extensively. For DP problems, I suggest tackling the hard and medium level challenges on LeetCode, while for graph problems, I found the CSES problem set to be quite helpful.\n\nAs you approach the last two months of your preparation, I strongly recommend using InterviewBit, as their problem set covers all the concepts you need to know and are likely to encounter in coding interviews( i did get one). During this time, you should also focus on solving puzzles and probability questions. For puzzles, I suggest checking out resources like \u201cHeard on the Street\u201d and GeeksforGeeks. For probability, you can try the book \u201c50 Challenging Problems in Probability.\u201d\n\nFinally, for CS core concepts like DBMS, OOPS, and networks, I suggest setting aside the last 2\u20133 weeks of your preparation to review and gain a rough understanding of these topics. You can refer to short notes on websites like AlgoZenith or GeeksforGeeks to help you quickly review and reinforce these concepts.\n\nAn important pointer: Don\u2019t get overwhelmed by all the different learning resources out there. Try to stick to one or two that really work for you, so you don\u2019t end up spending too much time wading through a ton of different stuff.\n\n4) What difficulties did you face while preparing for this Company/Profile? How did you overcome this problem\n\nOne of the biggest challenges I faced during my CDC preparation was the daunting amount of material to cover in a limited amount of time. To combat this, I found it helpful to team up with a small group of 2 or 3 peers. By setting targets and discussing problems together, we were able to make steady progress while also maintaining our mental well-being. I mean, let\u2019s face it, CDC prep can be pretty exhausting, so it\u2019s nice to have some support along the way. This approach allowed us to tackle difficult topics more efficiently and effectively.\n\n5) According to you, who should ideally apply for this job?\n\nAnyone who is interested in problem-solving and software development can apply for the software profile.\n\n6) Any specific advice you want to give to the junta sitting for internships this year.\n\n7)What are some of the major points you think would be valid to mention in your CV while targeting this profile?(any specific suggestions you would like to make?)"

        "content": "FORESIGHT(2023): Summer Internship at Goldman Sachs | Vishal Kumar |\n\n--\n\nListen\n\nHey everyone! My name is Vishal Kumar, and I am currently a 4th-year undergraduate student pursuing a dual degree in Mining Engineering. I am from Muzaffarpur,Bihar. This summer, I will be interning at Goldman Sachs.\n\n2. How did you secure an internship at Goldman Sachs? What was the selection procedure like?\n\nGoldman Sachs offers software and quant intern roles on our campus, open to students from all departments with no CGPA cutoff. The selection procedure consisted of two stages:\n\nFirst, there was an online test conducted on the Hackerrank platform a week before the interview. It comprised four sections:\n\nSection 1) Two Coding Questions:\n\nParticipants had to solve two coding questions in 30 minutes. The first question involved rearranging a string, ranging from easy to medium difficulty. The second question focused on matrices and graphs, presenting a medium to hard level challenge. Due to the time constraint, I was only able to completely solve the first question, while managing to pass some basic test cases for the second.\n\nSection 2) English Writing Skills:\n\nCandidates were required to write short answers to two questions within a total of 15 minutes. The questions were:\n\nWhat did you learn in your recent project?\n\nHow would you handle a situation where a team member is unable to complete their task, impacting your own performance?\n\nSection 3) CS Fundamentals:\n\nThis section included around 10 multiple-choice questions on topics like Object-Oriented Programming, Operating Systems, and Database Management Systems. Ample time was provided for this segment.\n\nSection 4) Quantitative Aptitude:\n\nThis section consisted of approximately 20 questions to be answered within 45 minutes. Although a few questions posed some challenges, a solid grasp of probability and basic logical ability was sufficient to navigate through this section.\n\nInterview Day:\n\nRound 1:\n\nThe round commenced with introductions, followed by the interviewer inquiring about a project from my CV. I provided a satisfactory response, after which I was presented with a puzzle involving 100 tigers and 1 sheep on an island. Although I had come across the puzzle before, I took my time, asked clarifying questions, and answered accordingly. Next, I was given a coding question through a Hackerrank ID and asked to share my screen. The question involved converting a fraction into a decimal, which was of medium difficulty on the LeetCode scale. I followed an almost correct approach throughout the code, even performing a dry run. This round lasted for 40 minutes.\n\nRound 2:\n\nThe final question involved finding the square root of a given number between 0 and 10\u2079. I explained the logic of using binary search and proceeded to write the code. I wrote the code for 1 to 10\u2079 and then used reverse logic for 0 to 1, which could be further optimized. Nevertheless, the interviewer appeared happy and satisfied. Towards the end, there were also questions regarding the company, my role, and growth opportunities. This round lasted for 45 minutes.\n\nFor most students selected from our campus, there was no HR round this time. However, it is advisable to familiarize yourself with basic HR questions.\n\n3. How should one prepare for the Goldman Sachs selection process?\n\nTo prepare for the online test, continue practicing Competitive Programming (CP) until the end. In the month leading up to the tests, shift your focus to platforms like LeetCode and InterviewBit to enhance your grasp of Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) questions.\n\nIf you lack confidence in your writing skills, practice writing concise answers to the questions mentioned earlier.\n\nFor the interviews, concentrate on strengthening your DSA knowledge and reviewing the fundamentals of Object-Oriented Programming. Additionally, explore resources like BrainStellar and YouTube for commonly asked probability and puzzle questions, as these are often covered in the initial round. During interviews, expect in-depth discussions on your CV, so ensure you have a thorough understanding of its contents. Utilize this opportunity to showcase your achievements and experiences.\n\n4. What difficulties did you face while preparing for this Company/Profile? How did you overcome them?\n\nStuck at similar rating levels:\n\nAt some point, individuals engaged in Competitive Programming may find themselves plateauing at a certain rating level. It is crucial to persist through this phase by solving a variety of problems and maintaining patience. Everyone faces this challenge, and only those who persevere ultimately succeed.\n\nOverwhelming amount of preparation:\n\nSome students pursuing B.Tech may feel they have less time compared to those in dual degree programs, resulting in a perception of having to cover a lot of ground. To overcome this, form a peer group and engage in discussions revolving around potential coding questions. This not only exposes you to different perspectives but also enables you to articulate your own thoughts effectively.\n\n5. Who should ideally apply for this job?\n\nIn my opinion, individuals with even a slight interest in finance or a desire to explore the field should definitely consider applying. Based on your performance in tests and interviews, you may be assigned roles related to finance or software development.\n\n6. Any specific advice for aspirants applying for internships this year?\n\nIn the previous year (2022\u201323), the entire process was conducted online. However, this year there is a possibility of the process returning to an offline format, similar to pre-COVID times. It is crucial to carefully read the instructions provided before starting any tests, as some sections may allow switching between them, providing an advantage. Practice numerous mock interviews, and articulate your thoughts and ideas confidently to the interviewer. Remember, if you began your preparation late and are unable to secure a good company through the CDC, it does not imply that you are less competent than those who performed well. Treat it as a valuable learning experience that will contribute to your personal growth. Additionally, prioritize the development of an impressive CV, as it can significantly distinguish you from other candidates.\n\n7. What are some major points you believe should be mentioned in your CV when targeting this profile? (Any specific suggestions?)\n\nAll the best for the upcoming internship season! Stay positive, stay motivated and be patient throughout the process."

In this blog, I am going to share my journey of how I got an internship in Goldman Sachs and their selection procedure.\n\nHow did you secure an internship at Goldman Sachs? How did you prepare for the same?\n\nMy journey started during the summer of 2021, right after the end of the 4th semester. It was a difficult time due to the pandemic, and we had very little to do. As per the advice of my seniors, I started doing CP (Competitive Programming). I was also doing two online internships simultaneously, which were unpaid, so I didn\u2019t feel much pressure. However, I would not recommend doing two paid internships in parallel.\n\nMy main focus was on CP, although I wasn\u2019t good at it. As soon as the 5th semester started, I stopped doing CP. I resumed it during the December break but left it again when the 6th semester started. I had secured a Mitacs internship for the summers of 2022, which was one of my biggest achievements and challenges. At that time, I didn\u2019t want to pursue research and was worried about my preparation for the CDC internship. However, I took the offer for Mitacs for two reasons: the project was on statistics, which would boost my CV, and who doesn\u2019t want a foreign trip?\n\nLuckily, my Mitacs project was not overloaded, and with the CDC internship in mind, I allocated an hour daily for my CDC preparation in May and June. I started ramping up those minutes in July. I cut my Mitacs internship one week short because the CDC internship test started earlier than expected, but I still missed the tests of a few companies, including Microsoft software, while I was on the flight.\n\nMy preparation was for Quant and Data profiles, and I was targeting Goldman Sachs the whole time because my CG was 8.98 at that time, so HFTs were out of scope.\n\nWhat was the selection procedure like?\n\nOn Day 1, I got shortlisted for GS only, so I was laser-focused for the interview. They took two rounds of interviews. In the first round, they asked me to give my introduction, and in the intro only, I made it clear that I wanted to go on the quant side (not telling them explicitly but giving hints like I like betting, guessing, probability, etc.). Then, they asked me questions based on my Mitacs project, for which I was well-prepared as I had just recently finished it.\n\nThen some basic probability questions and 1 CP question in each round. Few of which I remember,\n\n(i) Fair coin, prob of heads, prob of 3 heads, unfair coin: make a fair game.\n\n(ii) ant on cube can go to vertices randomly, expected time to reach diagonally opposite corner\n\n(iii) ant inside/on cube\n\n(iv) Time complexity of sieve, how its log of log\n\n(v) modified question on binary search\n\n(vi) prob of 3 points being in a semicircle\n\nOverall, my interview felt satisfactory to me and turned out satisfactory for them as well.\n\nWho should ideally apply for this job?\n\nIf you have an interest in Probability/ Combinatorics/ Statistics, you should apply for the Quant role in GS.\n\nAny specific advice for aspirants applying for internships this year?\n\nHere is some advice that is limited to the Quant role only:\n\n(i) STAT 110 is a super helpful course. I watched till lec 20 and did their exercises (important) as well.\n\n(ii) Heard on the street, Brainstellar, 50 challenging problems of Probability (attempt in this order preferably). Repeat the sequence again.\n\n(iii) Easy/ moderate questions on the interview bit is compulsory. Can/ Can\u2019t attempt hard based on time available/ skill level.\n\n(iv) In the coursework section of CV, highlight probability and data science courses.\n\n(v) Having a project in statistics/ modeling/ probability is a huge boost.\n\nMost importantly, be calm during the whole process. I know it\u2019s easy to say and hard to do from my experience. But I had some awesome friends around to help me do that, and everything turned out to be well after a lot of overthinking (which you should avoid).\n\nAll the best Junta for the upcoming CDC internship drive.

I am a final year undergraduate student enrolled in the B.Tech course of Manufacturing Science and Engineering. I will be interning with JP Morgan Chase & Co. \u2014 CIB Research and Analytics.\n\n2) How did you get into JP Morgan Chase Co.? What was the selection procedure?\n\nI applied for this role through ERP,IIT Kharagpur during the CDC Internship drive.The role was open for all the departments. The selection procedure was as follows:\n\nScreening Test\n\nThe online test consisted of 3 different sections \u2014 one of aptitude test,quant questions & probability statistics, the other had questions related to finance(factual and theoretical) and the last one was a coding section (2\u20133 coding questions of medium level). Interview:\n\nThe interview had several technical rounds and one HR round. I was asked a few puzzles and a few theoretical and numericals on probability statistics. They asked concepts of DSA ,OOPS (mostly implementation on python). This role required some understanding of finance as well and I was questioned on fundamentals of economics and finance. Moreover,I was also grilled on ML concepts and data science projects on my CV. The HR questions were pretty standard.\n\n3) How to prepare for them?\n\nFor aptitude and quant section,brush up on Probability and Statistics courses, CAT questions, JEE level math. Basically, solving fast and accurately in a time-constraint is required.I would suggest going through puzzles and guesstimates(I did some on interviewbit and brainstellar), get some basic knowledge on the domain of finance (online resources), practice DSA and be thorough with ML algorithms & concepts. If you have mentioned any projects or internships on your CV, have a good understanding of them.\n\n4) What difficulties did you face while preparing for this Company/Profile? How did you overcome this problem\n\nI would like to discuss the problems that I faced in general during the CDC Internship. Firstly, finding the right profile and right resources posed difficulties. Moreover, I started preparing quite late and was not able to complete DSA which requires a lot of practice. One thing which I realized at the time I was looking for an\n\ninternship was, that even if you are preparing for non-SDE roles still you should have some grip over DSA and other CSE topics. And lastly, CDC is a truly strenuous process.\n\nTo overcome the problems I faced, I would suggest exploring different profiles and collecting different materials early(profile wise resources are available) .\n\n5) According to you, who should ideally apply for this job?\n\nAnyone interested in machine learning, mathematics, data analytics and have some interest in finance should apply for this job.\n\n6) Any specific advice you want to give to the junta sitting for internships this year.\n\nI would advise everyone to not get frustrated and keep trying. It will be helpful if you have few friends to discuss during preparation. Take good advantage of the summer break to prepare yourself better. Get your CV verified (preferably from seniors and batchmates). Also,one thing that helped me the most in the interview was talking to a senior who had interned previously in the same profile and understanding the job description a bit. This gave me an idea of the kind and level of questions asked for this profile.\n\n7) What are some of the major points you think would be valid to mention in your CV while targeting this profile?(any specific suggestions you would like to make?\n\nI am not quite sure of the exact shortlisting criteria.

I am a 3rd year UG student of the Department of EE enrolled in its B-Tech 4-year course. I got my summer internship at Jaguar Land Rover under EV powertrain profile through CDC.\n\n2)How did you get into JLR? What was the selection procedure?\n\nTest:\n\na. JLR opens for three profiles \u2014 software, EV (EE and EECE), Mechanical\n\nb. Any combination (SDE / EV / Mech or any two can be written (SDE + EV / SDE + Mech)\n\nc. I have written only for the EV profile\n\nd. The test consists of three parts \u2014 Aptitude, Technical and coding round.\n\ne. The marking scheme is in such a way that the difficulty increases as you write correct answers: Easy -1 mark, average \u2014 3 marks, difficult \u2014 5 marks. This applies to both Aptitude and Technical rounds. The coding part consists of three coding questions.\n\nInterview:\n\nIn the technical round, they will ask questions mostly from the CV \u2014 related to projects, your sem courses, and your experiences in that particular profile. They test you mostly on your fundamental understanding, your way of approaching the question, and your problem-solving skills. They may ask some basic coding questions as well. Mostly they concentrated on my CV. One has to be perfect with their CV.\n\n3)How did you prepare for them?I revised analog and digital circuits and machines which were taught in the 3rd and 4th semesters. And I have gone through some video lectures for better clarification of the topics \u2014 Razavi for analog circuits, NPTEL video lectures for both digital circuits and machines. Once reading and covering lectures is done, I started solving Previous papers and Interview Questions(very important).

How did you overcome this problem?6) Any specific advice you want to give to the junta sitting for internships this year?\n\nI wasted most of my time deciding between core and non-core. I have spoken to some of my seniors and taken their suggestions. If you are interested in the core and are confident then start your preparation with the core itself. Three months of summer duration is very peak time for CDC preparation. Dividing your daily tasks and managing the time for preparation is very important. Divide your work for the three months properly. If you have any doubts regarding any topics or you may not be able to solve any problems, ping your seniors or friends, and seek their guidance and help. Refer to some good suggested videos on youtube for better understanding. Talk to seniors or discuss with your friends who are preparing for the same profile so that you can learn more and you can build up your confidence as well. Practicing previous paper questions is very important. You will get a good amount of ideas on the depth of the questions and how to manage your time during the exams. For the aptitude section, it is better to practice some questions before the exams so that you would not spend much time on these questions\n\n5) According to you, who should ideally apply for this job?\n\nHaving a clear knowledge of a particular profile is very important before starting preparation. As there are limited core companies, students who are really interested in core and want to pursue a career in the core domain can apply for this profile. One has to dedicate a lot of their time to solving and preparing for the core.

        "content": "FORESIGHT(2023): Summer Internship at Jaguar Land Rover| Avinash Kumar |\n\n--\n\nListen\n\nBrief Introduction:\n\nHello, my name is Avinash Kumar. I am from the electrical department enrolled in its Instrumentation Engineering Course. I am from Nawada, Bihar.\n\nHow did you get into JLR? What was the selection procedure?\n\nThere were only 2 steps in total, 1st is the online examination and the 2nd is the interview round.\n\nJLR came for roles in our campus. One can choose any roles. I chose EV powertrain and the software profiles. In the examination there were 3 sections as I remember. 1st section consists of mental ability and basic mathematics questions and the difficulty of the questions was of self-adjusting in nature. In the 2nd section there were 15\u201320 (exact count don\u2019t remember) questions and most of the questions was from the Power related stuffs and based on the direct formulas.\n\nIt would be good if you could practice GATE questions related to this topic. Some of the same as of the GATE. In the 3rd section, there were 3 coding questions (I won\u2019t discuss about this).\n\nFor the interview round, JLR came on day 2. It started with a general introduction. Then asked me a question regarding the interests and what I have done in this regard. After he asked me about the project mentioned in very great detail. He asked me to implement the Alpha-Beta pruning and min-max algorithm (This algorithm was mentioned in the resume). After that he asked me question regarding the Digital electronics (as I already told them that I am interested in the digital electronics circuit). He asked me to code D flip-flop in Verilog. Finally, they asked some basic questions regarding analog electronics. The panel was very friendly and helpful whenever I got stuck and made some minor mistakes.\n\nHow to prepare for them?\n\nStart with revising the power related courses (if you are Electrical), digital and electronics circuit. Questions related to minimization of gate, multiplexer is frequently being asked. Once you are done with these topics and feel confident, learning time analysis and the basics of Verilog would be useful. When asked, I said these courses has not been covered in the course and it will be taught in the upcoming semesters. For Verilog you can refer to lecture series by Prof. Indranil Sen Gupta and do some assignments for programming in Verilog.\n\nWhat difficulties did you face while preparing for this Company/Profile? How did you overcome this problem.\n\nAs such I did not face any difficulties during the procedure. I would advise you to stay cool and confident during the exam. Don\u2019t panic during the interview. Questions being asked are logical and can be solved with the cool mindset and following the standard procedure if you face any difficulty in some of the questions. Most important do not forget to revise the basics as these are building blocks of your entire preparation.\n\nAccording to you, who should ideally apply for this job?\n\nAnyone who is interested in core or covered the curriculum in great detail during the semester if not sure about the profile can sit for the process.\n\nAny specific advice you want to give to the junta sitting for internships this year.\n\nYou need to understand the fact that CDC is very chaotic and random in nature. In some of the companies\u2019 test you might feel down but don\u2019t let it affect your health. Stay confident and believe on the process and yourself.\n\nDuring the interview answer the questions calmly, boldly and listen to the panel calmly and patiently. Ask them to clarify if you have any doubt regarding the questions. Always try to share your thought process with them, as they focus more on the thought process rather than the final answer. If you have something about yourself then mention it in the introduction only as this may drive the whole interview towards your interests and the field in which you are interested.\n\nWhat are some of the major points you think would be valid to mention in your CV while targeting this profile?\n\nThey focus much on the resume part at least in my case. So, mention those things or related stuffs in which you are very much confident. You can do some self-projects to mention."

        "content": "FORESIGHT(2023): Summer Internship at NVIDIA | Madhav Raju Nair |\n\n--\n\nListen\n\n1) Brief Introduction\n\nHello everyone! My name is Madhav Raju Nair, I am a fourth-year undergraduate student pursuing my major in electronics and electrical communication engineering along with a minor in computer science and a micro in embedded systems. I am currently working at NVIDIA, Bangalore as a summer intern in the Sys-Perf Verification team. I\u2019m from Thiruvananthapuram, Kerala.\n\nTo give a brief background about myself, I have been passionate about robotics and embedded electronics since my first year as I worked on projects at Technology Robotix Society(TRS) and Areal Robotics Kharagpur(ARK). By the end of third year, after completing the department coursework till then, I was majorly interested in the fields of computer architecture and hardware security. I have previously worked under Prof. S.K.Nandy, Department of Computation and Data Sciences, IISc Bangalore on the project \u201cFPGA simulation of a multi-core reconfigurable processor\u201d and Prof. Debdeep Mukhopadhyay, Department of Computer Science and Engineering , IIT Kharagpur on the project \u201cDeriving Security Constructs from Natural Language\u201d.\n\n2) How did you get into Nvidia? What was the selection procedure?\n\nThe selection process had 2 stages; a written exam followed by an online interview.\n\nWritten exam : To appear for the NVIDIA written exam there was a CG cut off of 8. The online exam was of one hour duration and had nearly 20 questions if I remember correctly. Needless to say, camera/microphone were to be kept on during the test and tab change/ window minimization was prevented; but luckily, navigation between sections was allowed which lets you complete easier ones first. Apart from the general aptitude questions, the test covered programming fundamentals,basic probability and statistics, and digital electronics. Most of the digital electronics questions could be answered using topics covered in the 2nd year courses + some timing/verilog.\n\nInterview : After shortlisting, one round of online interviews was conducted. I was interviewed by a panel of 3 people and all of them were very friendly in nature. First I was asked to introduce myself and go through my CV briefly. I had a relevant project on my CV so we spent a couple of minutes discussing it. Then they moved on to questions from digital electronics most of which required a good understanding of the basics. Then a few simple programming questions were asked (in my case, about trees) in which they evidently gave importance to your approach.In some of the questions, I did not know the answer directly, but was able to discuss my thought process with them and arrive at the final soln. At last, a bunch of HR questions, why do you want to join the company, what kind of work are you expecting to do etc. were also asked.\n\n3) How to prepare for them?\n\nThe most important step is revising all the topics covered in 2nd-year digital electronics course; questions can be asked from basic circuits, registers, flip flops, multiplexers, PLL etc. Further, it\u2019ll be helpful to have an understanding of computer architecture, fundamentals of Verilog and timing analysis.As for the core topics study material, I am not able to provide a centralised repo or anything; I have used kgp course material, NPTEL lectures, Open Courseware, easy-and-popular Youtube playlists for different topics.\n\nRevising first year PDS coursework and then completing any of the DSA courses available online will be more than sufficient for the coding questions. [Rigourous practice of CP is not necessary for NVIDIA at least]. Lastly, aptitude questions, reasoning, puzzles etc can be practised from many resources available online.\n\nAccording to me, for the interview prep, focusing on the basics is important as one tends to spend the most amount of time on HR prep and CV prep during those days. You just have to remember an overview of the projects and courses mentioned on your CV since most of the questions are on your understanding of the fundamentals and a detailed scrutiny of CV is not going to happen. On the other hand, if there\u2019s a relevant project mentioned on your CV that the panel may be interested in hearing about, be prepared to talk about it and steer the discussion in a way to emphasise your individual contribution and results.\n\n4) What difficulties did you face while preparing for this Company/Profile? How did you overcome this problem?\n\nAs I was targeting core profile since the beginning, NVIDIA was on top of my list. But when the CDC internship drive was nearing, I was getting a bit overwhelmed as I tried to revise a lot of the advanced concepts and memorise all the work I\u2019d put on my cv. At this point, talking to seniors who\u2019d previously cracked NVIDIA helped a lot as they advised me to rather focus on the basics and keep calm. Maintaining a good physical and mental condition to give the tests and interviews during/after the hectic CDC week is another challenge; it is important to not lose hope, as there\u2019s a good chance that you will end up with a good summer intern/research project.\n\n5) According to you, who should ideally apply for this job?\n\nThere\u2019s a misconception that NVIDIA is a company for core enthusiasts, and even while working here it is mentioned quite often that it isn\u2019t a pure core company, and they have a lot of roles where ug ece knowledge is not applicable, in addition to low-level software dev roles. If you have the slightest interest in digital design and satisfy the criteria to apply, definitely do so. NVIDIA is a world renowned company, they do offer a competitive salary and the additional perks are pretty good \u2014 so do give it a shot\n\n6) Any specific advice you want to give to the junta sitting for internships this year?\n\n\u2192 Do not ever not apply to a good company thinking you wouldn\u2019t get in. Sometimes they would just be looking for a person whose aptitude they like regardless of their no. of previous internships or PoRs\n\n\u2192 During the interview be honest while answering the questions, and do not try to fake answers. It\u2019s usually more rewarding to go through your real thought process than panicking.\n\n\u2192 Keep letting your interviewer know how you\u2019re approaching the problem in steps, continuous interaction eases the atmosphere and they even help you get to the final solution sometimes.\n\n\u2192 Do not let the pressure cloud your vision and judgment. As it happens, regardless of the #Day1 pressure, many amazing companies choose to come to the CDC drive later if that\u2019s what matches with their schedule.\n\n\u2192 KGP summers are sultry and tiring; it is important to keep yourself hydrated and maintain a proper diet.\n\nIf anyone would like to discuss any CDC related matter that you think I might be able to help with, you can reach out to me at \u2014 https://www.linkedin.com/in/madhav-raju-nair-339b8754/\n\n7) What are some of the major points you think would be valid to mention in your CV while targeting this profile?\n\n\u2192 Be it coursework, projects or internships write them in the order of how confident you are about them! highlight/bold sentences you\u2019d like recruiters to notice.\n\n\u2192 Any research/experience is good experience even if it isn\u2019t exactly matching with the job role. As I already mentioned, in case of NVIDIA, your knowledge in the subject is way more important than the density of your CV.\n\n\u2192 if there are relevant projects, prepare small 2 min paragraphs on them; you will mostly be asked to \u2018briefly\u2019 explain them. You should be able to give a good summary without getting lost in the details."

It was one of the consulting firms that recruited interns through an on-campus process for the year 2022.\n\nThe process was as follows :\n\n1. CV Shortlist: The initial round of screening was based on our resumes. I submitted my CV on the CDC portal post which I received a shortlist confirmation\n\n2. Buddy Rounds: The shortlisted people are then allocated buddies. A buddy is allocated to clarify doubts, provide suggestions and most importantly to practise cases with. NOTE that these rounds are non-evaluative and are not counted as official interview rounds but should be treated as mock interviews in order to be better prepared for the official rounds.\n\n3.

I am Rishit Singhania, a fourth year undergraduate from the Department of Mathematics, IIT Kharagpur. I am a boarder of JCB Hall of Residence. I will be interning at AlphaGrep Securities in the Summer of 2023 as a Quantitative Trading Intern.\n\nHow did you get into Alphagrep Securities? What was the selection procedure?\n\nI got my internship through the CDC Internship process.\n\nThe first step was a common coding round for both Quant and Software roles. The questions were pretty good. The test comprised 5 questions to be solved in 90 minutes. Implementation skills matter a lot in these rounds. Even if you get the logic correct, you may end up making silly mistakes in your implementation thus losing vital time debugging your code.I was shortlisted for both Quant and Software profiles. In the interview for the Quant role, I was asked questions on conditional probability, puzzles and linearity of expectation. I was also asked a few algorithmic questions.\n\nHow to prepare for them?\n\nI started Competitive Programming after my first year. I would recommend giving contests on Codeforces and Atcoder. You should regularly take part in Atcoder Beginner Contests (ABC), usually held every Saturday. I felt that I got to learn something new after every ABC I took part in. For the interviews, you should complete the problems present in Interviewbit as they are slightly different to the problems you encounter in contests.\n\nFor studying Probability and Statistics, I followed the Stats 110 course available on YouTube. If you are targeting Quant role, you can prepare puzzles from the following resources:\n\nI studied Object Oriented Programming from the course slides and GeekforGeeks. If you have mentioned other CS courses in your CV, be prepared to answer questions on those topics in the interviews.\n\nYou should also take part in Grimoire of Code CDC Series contests which are organized nearer to the start of coding rounds. These contests contain questions from previous year coding rounds and can thus can be of great help.\n\nWhat difficulties did you face while preparing for this Company/Profile? How did you overcome this problem?\n\nOne of the major problems that I faced was not being able to decide what to do during the last few days before the interviews. I used to waste a lot of time making changes to my CV.I would highly recommend having a group of at least 2\u20133 people having the same targets as you. This helps a lot during the preparation phase as it creates a healthy environment where you can learn from each other and even push each other to work harder.\n\nAccording to you, who should ideally apply for this job?\n\nIf you are interested in the Quant role, you can apply for this role. HFTs usually prefer to take people from circuital departments.You need to have a decent grasp of Competitive Programming and be good at solving puzzles.For the systems role, you need to be prepared with core CS concepts such as Object Oriented Programming.\n\nAny specific advice you want to give to the junta sitting for internships this year?\n\nDuring the internship process, there will be times when you are going to doubt yourself. You need to have faith in yourself. Whenever you feel anxious, talk to someone close to you. Taking care of your mental health is really important. Eat healthy food and get plenty of sleep. Also this is the worst time to compare yourself with others. Just focus on yourself. You are going to be fine, believe me.\n\nYou should also be aware that you get partial points in most of the coding rounds. So if you are stuck with a problem, you can submit a brute-force to pass a few test cases and get partial points. Do not panic and be calm because if you make mistakes in your implementation, you will lose crucial time debugging your code.\n\nWhat are some of the major points you think would be valid to mention in your CV while targeting this profile? (any specific suggestions you would like to make?)\n\nHaving a high rating on Codeforces is always a major plus. You can also mention the ranks that you obtained in popular coding contests such as Google Kickstart and Facebook HackerCup.\n\nIf you have taken part in ICPC, make sure to mention that too. Do not mention courses or skills just for increasing the content of your CV. If you are not able to answer questions on something mentioned in your CV, it leaves a bad impression on the interviewer.\n\nTry to keep your CGPA above 9.\n\nIf you have any doubts, you can always reach out to me on Facebook."

I will be interning at Graviton Research Capital in the summer of 2023.\n\nHow did you get into Graviton? What was the selection procedure?\n\nI got into Graviton via the CDC Internship Program. Initially there was a test on HackerEarth, consisting of 2 coding problems to be solved in 75 minutes. First one was a hard shortest path problem involving Edge Space Reduction by constructing Pseudo nodes. Second problem was easy-medium based on number theory & sieve. I submitted both problems 32 minutes before the end of the test. They shortlisted 10\u201312 people who solved both problems.\n\nHow to prepare for them?\n\nCP is the most important skill required to grab an internship through CDC in day 1\u20132 companies. The difficulty of problems in coding rounds is increasing year by year. Apart from regular contests on Codeforces, CodeChef & Atcoder, do participate in competitions like ICPC, CodeJam, Kickstart, HashCode, HackerCup, SnackDown, etc. Mentioning good ranks in these contests give a huge boost to one\u2019s CV.\n\nMake sure to upsolve at least one problem more than what you could solve during the contest otherwise you\u2019re practically not making any significant progress despite the rating changes . Also, check out editorial & discuss with friends to get to know about alternate approaches for a problem.\n\nAlso, prepare for OOPS & have a thorough knowledge of C++ STL containers as many companies ask questions regarding them during interviews. Additionally for dual-degree students, CS fundamentals like OS, Networks, DBMS, etc also plays an important role during interviews.\n\nWhat difficulties did you face while preparing for this Company/Profile? How did you overcome this problem?\n\nAs I was mainly targeting HFTs for which good CP ratings play a major role, the main difficulty for me was to improve my CP skills and increase my ratings on Codeforces and Codechef.\n\nFor that, I started participating in CF from my alt account [shuklaji1102] & made sure to upsolve & look at editorials as much as possible. I also started solving A2OJ div2D ladder & covered around 30 problems there. Meanwhile, I learnt Segment Tree from cp-algorithms.com and practised problems in the CF-Edu section. After this, I spent the complete month of May on DP covering Simple DP, DP on trees, DP with bitmasking, Digit DP \u2014 first watching the respective Kartik Arora\u2019s playlist & then solving problems mentioned in various CF blogs. I also solved & highly recommend everyone to completely solve all problems of AtCoder Educational DP round \u2014 it covers almost all types of DP problems which you would be encountering at least till reaching purple in CF. After this extensive practice, DP & tree became my strongest topics and I was even able to solve 2200\u20132300 rated CF problems sometimes during the contests. Besides, I participated in all GOC-CDC series contests and it helped me a lot to understand the type and difficulty of questions asked in coding rounds of last year.\n\nAccording to you, who should ideally apply for this job?\n\nAnyone having deep interest in problem-solving, willing to learn how HFTs work and is ready to spend enough time on a fast paced competitive environment should apply for this company.\n\nAny specific advice you want to give to the junta sitting for internships this year.\n\nDon\u2019t get demotivated if things are not going according to the way you thought. Be patient, have faith in God and keep working hard, eventually you\u2019ll reach there! Try to be in constant touch with family members or friends who can motivate you through this journey.\n\nSome points regarding Coding Rounds : Make sure you choose the language you want to code in at the beginning itself. Few platforms don\u2019t allow copy-paste & your entire hard work may go waste. Also, try completing all problems as early as possible as many companies consider time of submission while shortlisting candidates. Do read the instructions very carefully and understand the policy of switching between various sections. If you can\u2019t think of a complete solution or you\u2019re not sure about your complete solution & running out of time, prefer submitting a brute force solution first with an aim to pass as many test cases as possible.\n\nWhat are some of the major points you think would be valid to mention in your CV while targeting this profile?(any specific suggestions you would like to make?)\n\nCV, as such, doesn\u2019t play a crucial role for day 1\u20132 companies. For HFTs, it would be good if you mention ranks in various competitive programming competitions and also your ratings in platforms like Codeforces and Codechef. One of my interviewers explicitly asked me about my CP achievements towards the end of my interview. Projects and EAA do not matter much if you\u2019re targeting HFTs."

There were two questions in the coding section on Binary Search and Dynamic Programming, which were pretty straightforward.\n\nMorgan Stanley shortlisted ten students for the interviews. There were three rounds. In the first round, I was asked many questions on probability and puzzles. In the second round, I was again tested a bit on probability, and then he asked me two coding questions \u2014 binary search on a matrix and DFS on trees. The interviewer seemed to be in a hurry and was interested in the most optimal solution only. Lastly, in the HR round, we discussed my projects. She also asked me a few situational questions.\n\nFinally, two students were given the Internship offer.\n\n3) How to prepare for them?\n\nI had started giving contests on Codeforces and CodeChef in my second year and solved the programming questions on Interviewbit in the months leading to the internship tests. The online test can seem lengthy, and I recommend giving each section equal importance.\n\nFor the interviews, you should revise basic probability and statistics. You should solve the \u2018top 100 puzzles asked in interviews\u2019 from GFG as they are asked directly(in other companies\u2019 interviews as well). Interviewbit should be enough for the coding questions. Prepare your CV well; you can expect a lot of questions on it. For the situational questions, try to give cases and be as elaborate as possible. Regarding your project, you should know what you have done and present it confidently. The topic of the project doesn\u2019t matter much.\n\n4) What difficulties did you face while preparing for this Company/Profile? How did you overcome this problem?\n\nI hadn\u2019t prepared finance for the tests or the interviews, so I couldn\u2019t answer many questions in the test. Thankfully, it was not an issue during my interviews, as nothing was asked related to it. Companies often say that knowledge of finance is optional; however, having information about the basic concepts can be a plus.\n\nDuring my first round of interview, I was asked to solve a question on probability using a specific concept that I didn\u2019t know. It\u2019s okay to not know stuff. You are not expected to know everything. The interviewers are helpful. He explained it to me and gave me another question which I answered.\n\n5) According to you, who should ideally apply for this job?\n\nAnybody who likes coding and working with numbers should apply for this job. Interest in finance is not a must, and it shall come gradually.\n\n6) Any specific advice you want to give to the junta sitting for internships this year.\n\nMake the best use of the vacation. Plan accordingly to prepare your best. Give contests on sites like Codeforces to stay in the groove for your coding tests, as speed is a significant factor. Think out loud during the interviews so the interviewer may guide you if you\u2019re stuck. Be thorough with your CV to be able to explain anything written on it.\n\n7) Kindly attach your resume. What are some of the major points you think would be valid to mention in your CV while targeting this profile? (any specific suggestions you would like to make?)\n\nHaving a project on your CV definitely helps. It can become a great point of discussion. You can also mention your achievements in coding competitions like Kickstart, Hackerrank, etc.\n\nThe whole process can be hectic. Make sure you eat and sleep properly. You can always reach out to me for any queries.\n\nBest of Luck, guys!"

        "content": "FORESIGHT(2023): Summer Internship at Morgan Stanley| Jaya Kediya |\n\n--\n\nListen\n\nHello, I am Jaya Kediya. I am a fourth year undergraduate enrolled in the 5-year integrated M.Sc. Course of Mathematics and Computing. I was born and brought up in Varanasi and have done most of my schooling from a boarding school in Dehradun. I enjoy solving puzzles, debating, reading, and talking about a lot of things in general, so feel free to ping me anytime :))\n\n2)How did you get into Morgan Stanley? What was the selection procedure?\n\nThe selection procedure included one online test and then interviews on Day 1 itself.\n\nThe online test had four major sections. The first was aptitude+ quant- it mostly had questions based on probability, puzzles, logical reasoning and some basic trigonometry. The second section was English \u2014 it had comprehension-based questions, basic grammar questions and also tested one\u2019s listening and speaking skills. The third section was on finance and the fourth was coding. The coding section had two questions, which were different for every candidate. Usually one question was very easy and basic ( for eg. Finding GCD of an array ) and the other question was medium to hard (eg. Resource Allocation Problem, DP etc)\n\nDoing well in three out of four sections and having a good CGPA is enough to get one shortlisted for the interviews.\n\nThere were a total of three rounds for the interviews \u2014 2 technical and 1 HR.\n\nThe first round began with questions based on CV. Being well prepared about all projects / interns that you have done is necessary here. The interviewer asks some questions based on any one project / internship in detail. So, it\u2019s important to know what exactly you worked on and how it was impactful. After CV based questions, the interviewer asked a few CP questions \u2014 which ranged from medium to hard. Most of these were similar to leetcode and interviewbit questions. I was asked a few questions on trees, dynamic programming and arrays. After this, the interviewer asked a few puzzles and once he was satisfied with my performance, asked me to wait in the meeting for the second round.\n\nThe second round was slightly more tough and more quant focused. It was also a pressure test to see how one survives under pressure when asked multiple questions rapidly. There were around 8\u20139 questions asked in rapid fire format- as in, the interviewer wanted answers very quick. The questions ranged from probability questions to some hard puzzles. There were a lot of questions on distributions, expectations etc. I was also asked to prove a question based on geometric distributions and derive a result.\n\nAfter the second round was over, I was immediately sent to the HR round. Here, the HR asked some situational questions (eg, I was asked about a time where I have resolved a conflict in a group). The main focus is to judge whether you\u2019re someone who is comfortable working with teams and have a collaborative and amicable nature. At the same time, they also try and get an idea about your personality and ensure you\u2019ll be a good fit for the firm culture.\n\nSoon after the HR round ended, I received a call regarding the offer.\n\n3. How to prepare for them?\n\nFor the entire process, two things must be focused upon\n\n4) What difficulties did you face while preparing for this Company/Profile? How did you overcome this problem\n\nGiven that I hadn\u2019t done a lot of CP beforehand, the biggest challenge for me was to up my skills in that area in the summer before the CDC internship drive. One thing that helped get a quick and good grasp of concepts was Algozenith videos. They\u2019re structured in a way that makes it easier to do well in a shorter time frame, so I\u2019d definitely recommend that for those who haven\u2019t been doing CP for 6 months or so already.\n\nOther than that, other challenges are getting good at thinking through puzzles. Initially, approaches to some probability questions/ puzzles might not strike as quickly, but it\u2019s all about practice, so one should practice as many questions as possible.\n\nThe key is to be confident in your abilities and have a good set of friends who can help you get through the process.\n\n5) According to you, who should ideally apply for this job\n\nAnyone who is interested in coding, prob-stats and quant/math in general and has an inclination or interest in finance should apply for this internship. You don\u2019t necessarily need to have much finance knowledge since this is a more quant role than finance, so don\u2019t worry if you aren\u2019t preparing for finance profile. There was no finance asked in the interview rounds at all.\n\n6) Any specific advice you want to give to the junta sitting for internships this year\n\nAlso, remember that this is just one part of life, and don\u2019t be too harsh on yourself. Take care of your health, nothing is worth sacrificing on that, and give it your best shot. All the very best :))\n\n7) What are some of the major points you think would be valid to mention in your CV while targeting this profile?(any specific suggestions you would like tomake?)\n\nMention any accolades that you have academically and all projects and internships you have done in the past. Also make sure to be thorough with each of them, you should know what exactly your role was and what your work entailed in detail. Morgan Stanley also places some weightage on CGPA, so try and maintain a good CGPA. They also pay some importance to co-curriculars etc so it\u2019s good to mention a few on your CV since that helps them get an idea of your personality.\n\nDon\u2019t stress too much about the CV though, firms like MS have a stronger emphasis on getting to know your skills based on questions and the test, so CV doesn\u2019t become as important. Build your CV well, get it reviewed by seniors and focus more on the prep for tests and interviews."

        "content": "FORESIGHT(2023): Summer Internship at Sprinklr| Agnibha Sinha |\n\n--\n\nListen\n\nBrief Introduction\n\nHello everyone! My name is Agnibha Sinha. I am a third year B.Tech student of the Department of Electronics & Electrical Communication Engineering. I will be interning this summer as a product engineer at Sprinklr.\n\nHow did you get into Sprinklr? What was the selection procedure?\n\nThere was an online test followed by 3 rounds of interview.\n\nOnline Test: The test was held on HackerEarth and had 3 coding questions which were to be solved in 90 minutes. The questions were based on sliding windows, finding cycles in graphs and a variation of DFS to partition a tree. Overall it was a good mix of easy, medium and difficult problems.\n\nInterview Round 1: This round lasted around an hour. It started with an introduction followed by a couple of tricky questions on predicting the output. Then we moved on to standard interview questions involving binary trees and prefix sums. We were required to code on google docs and explain the solution including corner cases and optimize the space & time complexities.\n\nInterview Round 2: The second round lasted for another hour and followed similar logistics to the first round. The questions this time were more ad hoc and observation based. A few questions were also asked on the projects on my CV.\n\nInterview Round 3: The third round was a Culture & Talent round which lasted around 40 minutes and it included standard HR questions and brief discussion on my PORs and extracurriculars. The interviewer is really friendly and it is a fun round to talk in.\n\nHow to prepare for them?\n\nThe primary skill needed for such roles is DSA as it covers both the online test and major part of the interviews. Make sure you understand all the important algorithms in depth. For practice, there are multiple free resources available. Leetcode & Interviewbit are good for getting a grasp of the standard questions. Participating in contests on Codeforces and Codechef regularly helps in improving your speed and ability to solve new problems on the spot. You may also go for paid courses like Algozenith.\n\nIn the last few days, go through a few CS fundamentals like OOPs, DBMS (You may require more knowledge on CS fundamentals if you are a dual degree student). Brush up prob stats and look at a few puzzles from Brainstellar.\n\nFor the interviews, be prepared with your CV. Look up a bit about how the company functions and its objectives. Also prepare a few standard HR questions.\n\nDuring the interview, speak confidently and do not hesitate to ask the interviewer for hints. Think out loud and explain the solution as you are coding it. A few mock interviews will surely help you with this.\n\nWhat difficulties did you face while preparing for this Company/Profile? How did you overcome this problem\n\nThe major difficulty is that there are a lot of things to cover in very less time. For overcoming this, set achievable and realistic targets and prioritize important things. Another difficulty is forgetting specific topics which is where notes come in handy. Make notes yourself on topics you are not confident about and refer to them frequently. Losing focus and motivation are other issues faced which is where having a good peer group helps.\n\nAccording to you, who should ideally apply for this job?\n\nAnyone interested in the software profile can apply for this job. In case you are not specifically inclined towards any role and do not repel coding, I would suggest you to prepare DSA which is the requirement for majority of the opportunities in CDC including this role.\n\nAny specific advice you want to give to the junta sitting for internships this year\n\nThe entire CDC process requires you to be motivated at all times. You will find there are a lot of factors like CG, department and sometimes just luck which may go against you. Try not to worry about these things as you have no control over them. Just focus on what you have at hand and give your best. Keep in touch with your friends and family. Feel free to reach out to seniors for any advice. Do not take stress and accept things as they turn out. Above all enjoy the process!\n\nWhat are some of the major points you think would be valid to mention in your CV while targeting this profile? (any specific suggestions you would like to make?)\n\nBe honest about what you write in your CV and be ready to explain everything in it. Highlight your projects and internships if you have any. A good project makes your resume stand out and can lead your interview. If you do not have projects currently, try some self projects but only after you are confident with DSA. You can mention your ratings on competitive programming websites and ranks in different contests. PORs do not have much value in the software role but do mention them if you have them as it may be one of the talking points in the HR round. Get your CV reviewed by a few seniors and follow proper formatting. Have a draft of the content you would put on your CV before the ERP portal opens up. Making a CV on ERP directly is not the smoothest process."

        "content": "FORESIGHT(2023): Summer Internship at Sprinklr | Adarsh |\n\n--\n\nListen\n\n1) Brief Introduction\n\nI am Adarsh, a 4th year undergraduate from the department of E&ECE. I am from Jamshedpur, Jharkhand. I like to play computer games, watch web series and talk with my friends.\n\n2) How did you get into Sprinklr? What was the selection procedure?\n\nThe selection procedure consisted of multiple rounds. The initial round was a coding round, which included three questions. The first question was based on arrays and prefix sums, while the other two were related to trees, involving mathematical concepts and dp on trees. The first question was relatively easy, while the second and third questions were of medium difficulty. I was able to complete all the problems within 45 minutes, which made me hopeful of being shortlisted.\n\nThe initial shortlist included students who were able to solve all the problems. However, later on, the shortlist was extended to include the students who completed two problems completely and one problem partially. This expanded shortlist advanced to the next stage, which comprised three rounds: two technical interviews and one HR round.\n\nIn the first technical round, the interviewer began by asking whether JavaScript is pass-by-value or pass-by-reference. I honestly admitted that I could guess but did not know for sure. The interviewer acknowledged my response and then presented me with a dynamic programming problem. Although I initially struggled to grasp the problem, I provided a brute-force approach. When the interviewer requested an optimized solution (which I hadn\u2019t considered at that moment), I asked for clarification to better understand the question. Once I comprehended the problem, I presented the optimal solution. The interviewer then asked me to open a text editor of my choice and write the code. During this process, he cross-questioned me, exploring alternative scenarios by suggesting modifications to the code. I confidently answered all the queries, and the interviewer praised my performance. However, he inquired about my knowledge of data structures. When he asked if I was familiar with segment trees, I responded affirmatively. He then posed some simple range query problems, which I successfully solved. Additionally, he specifically asked me about lazy propagation, to which I explained the logic. He further asked if I could code it without using a template, and I assured him that I could, although it might take some time. He accepted my answer, and we proceeded with the discussion, during which he shared information about the technology stack used at Sprinklr, emphasizing their focus on new technologies rather than legacy code.\n\nIn the second technical round, the interviewer began by emphasizing that the internship would be my first major project. He then proceeded to ask a problem related to topological sorting in graphs. I quickly understood the logic before he finished presenting the question and immediately recognized it as a topological sort problem. I explained the method to him, and he instructed me to write the code in my text editor. While coding, he provided guidance and pointed out any mistakes I made, allowing me to correct them. After completing the question, he presented problems related to expectation value, which surprised me since the role was for a software development engineer (SDE). Nevertheless, the problems were relatively easy, and I promptly solved them.\n\n3) How to prepare for them?\n\nAs a dual degree student, I observed the internship phase of the B.Tech students. To gather insights, I approached a friend (Shobhit Gupta) who had received an internship offer from Sprinklr and asked about his preparation strategy. He simply said \u2014 \u201cCP karlo ho jayega\u201d. Taking his suggestion, I began practicing CP problems from the beginning of my third year, primarily on Codeforces. Additionally, I watched videos from AlgoZenith, a resource for learning algorithms.\n\nInitially, I faced difficulties in solving C-level problems. To address this, I decided to complete the A2OJ Div2 C ladder, which proved to be an effective way to enhance my problem-solving skills. I finished the ladder in November. Soon after, I started participating in Codeforces contests, and by December, I achieved the Expert rating (although I was fortunate since there were two Div3 rounds during that time since to become expert in second ID it took me much more time). After completing the Div2 C ladder, I moved on to the Div2 D ladder. This ladder introduced me to various new types of problems related to algorithms and data structures that I was unfamiliar with at the time. To learn these new concepts, I relied on resources such as the cpalgorithms website and blogs on Codeforces and practiced those on cses before proceeding to codeforces. I also studied the code of highly-rated coders to understand how to implement techniques efficiently.\n\nIn January, IIT Kharagpur announced an offline semester. Initially, I did not focus much on CP due to the offline activities. However, when the COVID-19 cases surged, I returned home and resumed my practice. During the offline part of semester, I gave my time to participating in contests(I had 2IDs and I used to give contests from the ID that was lower in rating this maintained the stability) , but I couldn\u2019t practice as intensively on campus. Once the exams were over, I returned home and began practicing more rigorously. I set a filter for problems in the range of 1800 to 2200 and worked on solving problems within that range. I continued using the strategy of two Codeforces accounts mentioned earlier, participating in contests from the account with the lower rating to maintain a stable overall rating.\n\nAround one month before the internship tests, I was able to solve four problems in Div2 contests. Additionally, I started practicing on InterviewBit, although I couldn\u2019t complete the platform (I had covered about half of the problems by the time the tests began). On Codeforces, my ratings were 1887 and 1869 on my first and second accounts, respectively, at the time of the tests. Overall, practicing on Codeforces significantly helped me since the platform exposes you to a wide range of problems, including those that may appear unexpectedly in tests or interviews.\n\n4) What difficulties did you face while preparing for this Company/Profile? How did you overcome this problem?\n\nI did not encounter any specific difficulties. However, I believe that if the third year had been conducted offline, it would have presented numerous challenges due to time constraints and other commitments in college.\n\n5) According to you, who should ideally apply for this job?\n\nI guess anyone who has an interest in software development and likes problem-solving.\n\n6) Any specific advice you want to give to the junta sitting for internships this year?\n\nSame advice as my friend gave to me \u2014 \u201cCP karlo ho jayega\u201d.\n\n7) What are some of the major points you think would be valid to mention in your CV while targeting this profile?(any specific suggestions you would like to make?)\n\nProjects are not very important. In my personal experience, the interviewer did not inquire about my projects. However, if you choose to include good projects in your CV, be prepared to be grilled on them."

I am a boarder of Azad Hall of Residence and I am from Jaipur, Rajasthan. I have my upcoming summer internship at Sprinklr as a product development intern.\n\n2) How did you get into Sprinklr? What was the selection procedure?\n\nThe selection process for Sprinklr involves a coding test with three questions, two of medium difficulty and one hard, followed by three rounds of interviews, including two technical and one HR. The coding questions covered topics such as Dynamic Programming, trees, and graphs, and those who successfully solved all three questions were invited to the interview stage.\n\nThe first technical interview focused solely on Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA), where I was presented with questions on bit manipulation, 0\u20131 BFS, Binary search, and Dynamic Programming. After explaining my solutions, I was asked to code them on a Google doc to ensure my understanding of the concepts.\n\nThe second round of technical interview centered around my CV, as I had previous experience in ML and Data Science, with Mitacs and other relevant internships and projects. I was asked to code an image classifier in a language of my choice, without using any external help. I mostly wrote a pseudo-code, and the interviewer focused on the order of operations and the correctness of function names and arguments. Additionally, they asked me various questions about why I was using certain techniques, such as AdaGrad, what other gradient descent algorithms were available, why I was using softmax activation in the last layer, and why activation functions were necessary. They also asked me a few questions about matrix algebra and probability. Many people who had a software CV were asked DSA in round 2 also.\n\nAfter this interview, we had a discussion about the projects and work-life at Sprinklr, which left me feeling confident about proceeding to the next round.\n\nThe third round of interviews aimed to assess my cultural fit with the company, and I had prepared by researching Sprinklr\u2019s core values, mission, and beliefs during the 10\u201315 minute break between the previous round and this one. During this interview, I was asked about my strengths and weaknesses and presented with situational tasks to evaluate how I would handle real corporate situations. They also asked me about my experiences with NSS work and Mitacs.\n\nI answered each question carefully, taking time to consider my responses, as I had been advised by seniors that Sprinklr was known for its selective HR process. After this final round, I felt confident about my chances of being offered a position, and shortly thereafter, I received a call from the CDC representative confirming my selection.\n\n3) How to prepare for them?\n\nIf you are interested in coding, I highly recommend dedicating significant time to practicing on Codeforces and LeetCode. Solving coding challenges within the given time frame is crucial for improving your speed and accuracy. Many of the questions on the coding tests I encountered were similar to those found on LeetCode. I personally solved around 400 questions from the well-known LeetCode sheet and also used InterviewBit in the final months of my preparation to reinforce my understanding of key concepts. To get the most out of Codeforces, I recommend\n\ntaking past contests as virtual contests. After a contest, it\u2019s important to dedicate time to \u201cupsolving\u201d, and I suggest trying to solve at least CF D-level problems. For topics that need more strengthening, I suggest using tags to find related questions. And lastly, I strongly recommend taking dynamic programming seriously, as it\u2019s an essential skill for any coding test.I will recommend Aditya Verma DP playlist on Youtube as well as Algozenith DP theory.\n\nFor those seeking to specialize in Machine Learning, I highly recommend reading the book \u201cHands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow\u201d. This resource provides an excellent overview of almost all ML and DL concepts, and I do not recall encountering a question on an interview that was not covered in the book. I do, however, advise that readers should have a foundational understanding of ML and DL concepts before reading this book. For example, taking Andrew Ng\u2019s ML course and the Deep Learning Specialization on Coursera (consisting of 5 courses) is highly recommended. I believe these resources cover most of the ML and DL questions one is likely to encounter in interviews.\n\n4) What difficulties did you face while preparing for this Company/Profile? How did you overcome this problem?\n\nOne of the biggest challenges I faced while preparing for a software role was maintaining a consistent coding practice during the summers. However, I was fortunate to have a supportive friend who helped me stay motivated by solving coding problems together. This mutual support system helped us both to improve our coding skills and perform well in coding contests. We would often discuss our approaches to coding problems for hours, which helped me to articulate my ideas more effectively during interviews.\n\nAdditionally, I was doing a MITACS internship at the same time, which left me with limited time to code compared to my peers. To overcome this, I recommend starting preparation early, ideally in December, to gain a competitive edge by the start of summer. In my preparation, I also studied fundamental concepts such as OOPs, SQL, and OS. These concepts helped me to have a better understanding of software development principles and apply them effectively during interviews.\n\n5) According to you, who should ideally apply for this job?\n\nIf you are confident with Competitive Programming and have a good understanding of Data Structures and Algorithms you must apply for this role. I think that is all Sprinklr wants and whatever additional skills you have like Web Dev or ML is just a bonus.\n\n6) Any specific advice you want to give to the junta sitting for internships this year.\n\nI suggest that applicants should not focus on a specific company but instead apply to several companies with similar backgrounds. Don\u2019t get discouraged if you don\u2019t receive an interview invitation from your dream company. Keep applying to other companies as you may end up in an even better one."

        "content": "FORESIGHT(2023): Summer Internship at Oracle | Gautam Singla |\n\n--\n\nListen\n\n1) Brief Introduction\n\nHello! I am Gautam Singla, a fourth-year undergraduate studying Mathematics and Computing at IIT Kharagpur. I will intern at Oracle in the Summer of 2023 as a Server Technology Intern. This blog is about my preparation and experience of coding rounds and interviews in the CDC Internship Process 2022\u201323.I was shortlisted for two companies on day 2 for interviews. These were Intuit and Oracle.\n\n2) How did you get into Oracle? What was the selection procedure?\n\nOracle conducts one online test consisting of many MCQs from every topic: Data structures, Mathematics, Reasoning, and English. It was a 2-hour long test. Questions were not too hard if you know about these topics (B-Tree, AVL Tree).\n\nSome students are shortlisted based on the above test, and CGPA plays a role in shortlisting for the interviews. After being shortlisted for interviews, they generally conduct three rounds, consisting of two technical rounds and one hr round. But I was one of the last students they interviewed, so there were three technical rounds for me. In the last round, the interviewer in the starting itself told me that they were expecting answers to all the questions.\n\n3) How to prepare for them?\n\nThe primary skill needed for someone sitting for an SDE role is Competitive Programming. I have done the Algozenith course AZ-201, which helped cover all the topics in detail.\n\nI have given leet code contests regularly. You must also upsolve problems that you were not able to solve during contests. Upsolving is important to improve your problem-solving skills. Don\u2019t just read the editorial; try to implement the solution yourself.\n\nSolving a lot of problems will improve your implementation skills which are important because if you write buggy codes during the coding rounds, you will not have enough time to debug your code even if your logic is correct. Also, if you have solved many problems, most coding round questions will seem familiar, and you will not have to spend much time thinking about the solution.\n\nAlso, keep giving contests organized by Google and Facebook, such as Kickstart and HackerCup. You can use the ranks obtained in these contests in your CV. I have also mentioned my Google Kickstart rank.\n\nI studied Object Oriented Programming from the course slides and GeekforGeeks. I have not studied Operating Systems or DBMS, and that will not be an issue, as you can tell the interviewer if you don\u2019t know these topics. If you have mentioned anything related to any other subject in your CV, you must know it.\n\n4) What difficulties did you face while preparing for this Company/Profile? How did you overcome this problem?\n\nInterviewer Rounds\n\nRound 1\n\nIt was an easy round which lasted for about 40 minutes. You will be asked to introduce yourself at the start of the round. You should prepare one short introduction which summarizes your profile. After the introduction, I was asked to explain one of my projects. You should prepare for the projects mentioned in your CV. If you are not able to explain things on your resume, it has a bad impact on you. One coding question was asked based on stacks, which was an easy question.\n\nRound 2\n\nIn this round, I was asked to introduce myself. In this round, my interviewer chose one of my projects written in my resume. So, you have to prepare for all the projects mentioned in your resume, as the interviewer can choose any random project from your resume. After that, I was asked a question from the Operating System, to which I replied that I had not studied this topic as of now. So, then they asked some questions on OOPS.\n\nRound 3\n\nGenerally, this was a hr round, but it was also a technical round for me. At the start of the interview, I was asked if they were expecting I will answer all the questions. They have asked me if I regret anything about two rounds before this round. After that, I was asked a simple question based on DFS in graphs. I was asked two puzzles at the end of the round. I was able to answer all the questions.\n\n5) According to you, who should ideally apply for this job?\n\nAnyone who has an experience in software profile and wants to have an experience in this domain should apply for this company.\n\n6) Any specific advice you want to give to the junta sitting for internships this year.\n\nCP is very important. Start as early as possible, and I recommend doing Competitive Programming over internships/projects in your free time.\n\n7) What are some of the major points you think would be valid to mention in your CV while targeting this profile?(any specific suggestions you would like to make?)\n\nYou should have three important things to write in your resume (2 projects, one internship, or three projects). Please be honest about whatever you write in your resume. The prior internship experience is good but not compulsory for grabbing an offer in CDC. I didn\u2019t have any internship experience before this."

        "content": "FORESIGHT(2023): Summer Internship at Oracle| Riddhiman Moulick|\n\n--\n\nListen\n\n1. Brief Introduction\n\nHi, I\u2019m Riddhiman Moulick, a final-year undergraduate in the Department of Electrical Engineering enrolled in its BTech Course.\n\n2. How did you get into Oracle? What was the selection procedure?\n\nSo, Oracle had a common test for its Applications Developer and Server Technology roles. The written test consisted of multiple timed sections. These sections consisted of MCQ/paragraph questions on General Aptitude, English, some fundamental CS concepts, and DSA (with a focus on AVL trees, different tree traversals, etc.)\n\nThe interview shortlists consisted of around 12\u201314 candidates for each role. I had 3 rounds of interviews.\n\nThe first round started off with a few questions on probability and PnC. Each answer had a short discussion on the approach as well. Then I was given a coding question on the HackerEarth platform based on the sliding window technique. I initially coded out the brute force solution and then moved on to the optimal solution but before I could complete it the time was almost over. So, I explained the approach I had thought of, to the interviewer with which he seemed to be happy. This round took around 50 minutes.\n\nThe next round first involved a detailed discussion of the projects in my CV followed by 1 coding question and an interesting puzzle over which we had a fairly long discussion. I was also asked whether I knew DBMS to which I replied that I was only familiar with the basics. The interviewer\n\nwas fine with this and instead asked me some questions on OOPs and Data Structures. This round went on for about 45 minutes.\n\nThe last round was mostly an HR round with standard behavioral questions and only 1 coding question on recursion and some basic mathematics. This round took about 30 minutes. The interviewers were very friendly which helped in having a sense of comfort during the interview.\n\n3. How to prepare for them?\n\nI personally started off a little late because of which I had to rush my preparation, so to get a good topic-wise understanding, I solved questions from InterviewBit and later on moved on to practice from Leetcode. But if you have sufficient time on your hands then definitely get as much practice as possible from CP/ regular contests as they will help you to improve your speed much more and reduce the need to think more on questions on the spot.\n\n4. What difficulties did you face while preparing for this Company/Profile? How did you overcome this problem?\n\nThe major difficulty I faced was due to my late start due to which I had less time in my hand (which was also majorly due to my dilemma as to which profiles I should focus more on). During my preparation, whenever I got stuck on a topic I used to solve more questions on the same topic for which I found the bucket-wise questions in InterviewBit to be very helpful. And specifically for this profile, it is helpful to have a working knowledge of other basic CS concepts as well, for both written and interview rounds for which I had to devote time towards the end.\n\n5. According to you, who should ideally apply for this job?\n\nAnyone who is interested in getting to know and working with new technologies, likes DSA, and wants to explore Software Development can apply for this role.\n\n6. Any specific advice you want to give to the junta sitting for internships this year?\n\nThe entire CDC phase is a long and mentally exhausting process. There are a lot of things that can go south even after a great preparation. Try not to get stressed out in such times and discuss whatever you feel, with whomever you are comfortable with, be it your friends or family. Keep in mind that a lot of things are beyond our control so just stay calm and give it your best!\n\n7. What are some of the major points you think would be valid to mention in your CV while targeting this profile? (any specific suggestions you would like to make?\n\nHaving previous projects or internships gives you control over the topic during the CV discussion with the interviewer so be sure to highlight such points in your CV. Be thorough with all the points in your CV and give it a look before the interview as you can be asked to describe specific parts of your projects too."

What was the selection procedure?\n\nA high CGPA, a well-prepared CV and a CS major played an important role in getting shortlisted for the interviews as Quadeye did not conduct any coding rounds. Selection involved 4\u20135 rounds of technical interviews which started with simple CP problems and basic CS concepts (OOPS) and moved onto complex CP problems and intermediate CS concepts involving Networks, Computer Architecture and Operating Systems (OS).\n\nHow to prepare for the role?\n\nPractice CP questions to hone your algorithmic skills since they ask such questions in every technical interview. Moreover, it is important to have in-depth knowledge about CS concepts. OOPS, Networks and OS are very important for Dual Degree students.\n\nB.Tech students need to focus on OOPS.

How did you overcome this problem?\n\nCP does not come easily to a lot of people, including me. Practice is the only way to get across this hurdle. There is no other way. CS concepts can get tricky at times. I cleared them using standard CS books (CLRS for algorithms, Hennessy-Patterson for Computer Organization) whenever necessary.

        "content": "FORESIGHT(2023): Summer Internship at Quadeye| Vishal Subramanyam|\n\n--\n\nListen\n\nBrief Introduction\n\nHey, I\u2019m Vishal Subramanyam, from the Department of Computer Science and Engineering, enrolled in its B.Tech. course. I interned at Quadeye in the summer of 2023 as a systems engineer. I\u2019m writing this post hoping my preparation strategy helps those sitting for CDC better understand my journey.\n\nHow did you get into Quadeye? What was the selection procedure?\n\nQuadeye had a direct CV-based shortlisting. Unlike most companies that held CP-based programming tests as a filter, Quadeye didn\u2019t conduct a coding round, and I was called for an interview directly.\n\nThe interview started with basic questions on common data structures like linked lists, heaps, etc. Later we progressed towards implementing basic algorithms such as binary search, where I had to write C++ code and discuss various edge cases. I then had to answer a few questions on object-oriented programming in C++ about how things like virtual functions are implemented in C++. I was also asked about modern revisions to the C++ standard and new features in recent versions. After that, there was an HR round that was simply a conversation about the company and the things I knew about it.\n\nHow to prepare for them?\n\nMy CS courses, such as Algorithms 1 and Software Engineering, were greatly helpful in setting the base. Apart from this, I studied C++ separately since that wasn\u2019t a skill one usually learns from competitive programming. I used textbooks like C++ Primer and Effective Modern C++ for this. I also used to spend time reading the source code of different open-source projects to get a feel for real-world code since this is not something that you usually get from coursework.\n\nApart from this, I did the usual CP preparation that everyone else did, using sites such as Codeforces and InterviewBit. Although this helped me attempt the coding tests for other companies, my competitive programming skills were not tested during the Quadeye interview. So how should an interested candidate prepare for Quadeye, assuming they\u2019re done hedging their bets by doing CP for other companies?\n\nAccording to you, who should ideally apply for this job?\n\nIf you have a deep fascination for the inner workings of computers and are constantly driven by curiosity to explore implementation-level intricacies, such as the internals of your operating system and how networking protocols function, consider applying.\n\nHFTs, in general, are a bit different in how they select interns compared to companies that usually come for software-related profiles. My company, Quadeye, cares a lot about one\u2019s CS fundamentals, and minimal emphasis is placed on competitive programming skills. As far as I\u2019ve seen, a student\u2019s Codeforces or Codechef rating is not even considered. I didn\u2019t do CP intensely; my low Codeforces rating backs that. This is not to say that other companies don\u2019t focus on CP ratings and tests. Anyone reading this post should take coding tests seriously and prepare for them using resources such as Leetcode, InterviewBit, CSES, Grimoire of Code contests, etc., since it is wiser to hedge your bets across multiple companies.\n\nSo what exactly do these companies want? They want students with high CGPAs from departments like CS, MnC, and ECE since they believe this is a good indicator of the intern\u2019s ability to perform well at the job. Having a CGPA above 9 is a must.\n\nThis might be disappointing to interested candidates from other departments who might be interested, but it is what it is. Assuming you\u2019ve passed this primary filter, the company then wants you to be someone who can muck around with low-level implementation details instead of only being able to import libraries and use high-level APIs and function calls since anyone can do that.\n\nAny specific advice you want to give to the junta sitting for internships this year?\n\nI won\u2019t be giving advice that is already common knowledge at this point. Instead, I will use this space to remind the readers that the CDC internship season shouldn\u2019t be a toxic rat race and a measure for determining your worth. I know how pervasive the culture of propping up those who get high-paying offers is and how it can affect the psyche and goals of those who don\u2019t get them. Companies hire and fire based on their needs, and it might not be an accurate measure of someone\u2019s skills. This season is meant to be an interface between the industry and the student population to get a taste of the real world, and it should be viewed as such."

How did you overcome this problem?\n\nOne of the major difficulties I faced while preparing was actually finding the clever and short method to solve the puzzles they ask. One is you go the long way to solve the problem and other is finding the critical observation which converts the daunting problem into an easy one. To overcome this, I mostly sat with my friend Kunal Singh and he helped me with taking lots of mock interviews where he would ask me a random puzzle and helped me reach the most optimal solution through well thought out hints by him.\n\n5) According to you, who should ideally apply for this job?\n\nAn ideal student for this role is the one who is not afraid of new problems thrown at him and loves to tackle challenges. The candidate should be quick in arriving at solutions mostly intuitively. He/she should have a very deep understanding of the concepts as the questions get more and more tricky and conceptual.\n\n6) Any specific advice you want to give to the junta sitting for internships this year?\n\nPrepare Object Oriented Programming as a first step along with the fundamentals of Operating Systems.

        "content": "FORESIGHT(2023): Summer Internship at Adobe | Raghav Aggarwal |\n\n--\n\nListen\n\n1) Brief Introduction.\n\nHi everyone! My name is Raghav Aggarwal. I am a final year undergrad from Electronics and Electrical Communications at IITKgp.\n\n2) How did you get into Adobe? What was the selection procedure?\n\nI applied to Adobe via the CDC internship program organized by CDC, IITKgp.\n\nThe first round was the coding test which contained pretty cliche questions in DSA with some alterations. I wouldn\u2019t say the test was easy but it wasn\u2019t on the too challenging side as well. The coding round was common to both Research and Product Development roles.\n\nThe first interview round was a pretty basic DSA round where they asked standard questions and then one hard difficulty question(grading the questions according to leetcode standards) before proceeding to the final interview stage.\n\nThe final interview was taken by a senior developer in the firm whose primary source of questions was my CV. He first went through all the projects and experiences and then selected a project to discuss in depth.\n\n3) How to prepare for them?\n\nFor the Coding round do interviewbit, leetcode and try timely practicing questions of DSA. One thing students get often confused between is Competitive Programming and DSA. They\u2019re not the same and hence if you\u2019re practicing on just Codeforces or Codechef start doing DSA practice as well. CP is good for timed practice and increasing analytical thinking but most of the companies in SDE are going to ask questions based on fundamental applications of DSA.\n\nFor the interview prep I\u2019d suggest making notes of your CV where you have pointers to explain each and every project/experience in both brief and detail. This will help you in a lot of interviews. Most of the interviewers I faced just asked me to skim through my projects and then asked detailed questions from a particular area in some project.\n\nAlso do remember to learn basics of computer memory organization (stack memory, etc.). It\u2019s not generally asked by any other firms but Adobe interviewers always ask questions from this area. You do not need to prepare thoroughly, a short 1\u20132 hour research on YouTube before the interview will suffice.\n\n4) According to you, who should ideally apply for this job?\n\nAs for the product development intern role, anyone who\u2019s interested in development and DevOps should definitely apply to this firm. The people around here are experts in their fields with a significant amount of experience. The guidance and learnings you will be provided here are unparalleled. Also the projects are based on Adobe\u2019s flagship products, hence you get to work on pretty fascinating and cutting edge tech. The code you\u2019ll be working on is going to be the production level code of the products and you get to learn a lot from the coding style itself used here.\n\n5) Any specific advice you want to give to the junta sitting for internships this year?\n\nDo talk to a senior in the same company before sitting for the interview. It always helps to know what the company might be expecting in the interview and provides you with an edge.\n\nDo not lie to the interviewer or give \u201cfundaes\u201d. These people are usually experts in their domain and know when someone is trying to fool them.\n\nDo let them know of your thought process while giving an answer in the DSA rounds, they might help you in the direction of the solution or warn you when you wander too far. They are more interested in your thought process than the final answer.\n\nAnd DON\u2019T GIVE UP! This might be the most important. You might be not shortlisted a lot of times or get rejected from an interview which went perfectly but sometimes things don\u2019t work in the way they should and misfortunes happen. Believe me there are plenty of better companies which come in the later days and it\u2019s going through the process itself which will make you learn a lot.\n\n6) What are some of the major points you think would be valid to mention in your CV while targeting this profile? (any specific suggestions you would like to make?)\n\nThe interviewer in my panel got fascinated by a simple C++ project (not DSA) because he had experience with similar kind of technology. One-third of my second interview went in just discussing that project which really made a good impression on my interviewer. Although the majority of us have works in Python, Machine Learning, etc. do remember to have a little diversity in the projects/experience section."

        "content": "FORESIGHT(2023): Summer Internship at Nomura| Anshul Jadhav|\n\n--\n\nListen\n\n1) Brief Introduction\n\nMy name is Anshul Jadhav. I\u2019m a pre-final year undergraduate student enrolled in the dual degree course of the Department of Metallurgy and material science with a specialization in the Financial Programme. I got an Internship at Nomura in the Global Markets division and will join them around May this year.\n\n2) How did you get into Nomura? What was the selection procedure?\n\nSo I was shortlisted for 2 Nomura analyst profiles(Global Markets and Wholesale Banking). Nomura Global markets had a CV screening round, after which we were directly called for Group Discussion. Both profiles had two interview rounds followed by an HR round. Across the two rounds, you meet with people with varied seniority ranging from 5 years to 15 years of experience. Usually, 1 or 2 of them are KGP alums. Each round was a mix of both domains and HR(convincing them why that particular profile mainly). Each round lasted from 30\u201340 mins. Then, the standard HR round at last after you clear previous rounds.\n\nBoth interviews had questions from my internship experience, probability, puzzles, basic finance, derivatives, bonds, pricing models, etc. The discussion can be finance-centric if you have relevant experience; otherwise, they check your problem-solving skills and how quickly you can learn and apply them. There were some questions from Python. Other rounds had questions from economics, various portfolio optimization techniques, investment strategies, and financial statements. A common question in all the rounds for both profiles was: Why do you want to go into finance? Why Global Markets? These were some of the most important questions in all the rounds, and hence you need to convince the interviewer absolutely, why you are the best fit for the role!\n\n3) How to prepare for them?\n\nOne should start company-specific preparation at least 4 to 5 days before day 1. For Nomura, I got the information about the shortlists two days before the interview for both profiles. I focussed specifically on my CV. I interned at a financial services company(Motilal Oswal Financial Services). So I kept in mind to go through all the concepts on my CV related to that. Revising economics and basic finance concepts, I couldn\u2019t do a lot because of time constraints. My specific focus was on getting the basics revised.\n\nI prepared for the HR round well on the last day as they played an essential role in non-tech or management trainee roles. You should know about the company\u2019s business to a good extent, what they do and how they make money. These questions are usually asked for such roles. Your interest and efforts in joining them are one of the most important aspects they evaluate apart from domain knowledge.\n\n4) What difficulties did you face while preparing for this Company/Profile? How did you overcome this problem\n\nFor pre-final year students, deciding on the profile you want to pursue is the first thing you should focus on. Talking specifically about Analytics, product, consulting, or finance, you have your specific preparation for each of them. I had decided in my 2nd year onwards that I would only try for a finance role as that is what I was interested in. There are some generic preparation materials for quant, like the 50 challenging problems in probability, Heard on the Street, and Brainstellar puzzles are a gem of resources. It would be best if you prepared them well. Most of the questions will be asked from them, specifically for quantitative, finance & analytics roles.\n\nFor finance, if you have done any certification or competition (CFA, FRM, etc.), those things are usually discussed in all rounds. Specific resources would involve CFA level 1 or the finance-related courses offered by VGSOM, IIT KHARAGPUR. Try getting research projects in this domain at VGSOM, ISB, IIMs, or other foreign universities. Internships in this domain will give you an edge in the CV screening round and a good amount of details to discuss during the interview. I can say for Nomura with certainty that having a finance background helps in CV screening rounds, but after that everyone(Finance and Non-finance background) stands an equal chance of getting through depending on how you take the interview ahead and convincing them why you should be there. You should try to capitalize on your strength that is relevant to the domain. There was a situation during one of the rounds where I mentioned I am pretty well-versed in current affairs related to macroeconomics, following which they asked me 5\u20136 rapid 3\u20134 digits multiplication questions, and they expected a quick correct response. Thus I would say being true to your preparation is very important.\n\n5) According to you, who should ideally apply for this job?\n\nThe role is one of the few roles which is focused majorly on finance, especially for the companies which come on day 1 of the CDC internship. So anyone firm about their decision to enter into a finance role should apply for this job.\n\n6) Any specific advice you want to give to the junta sitting for internships this year?\n\nThese 4 things should be in your mind:\n\n1)Always ask the interviewer for a hint if you are stuck. Solving a problem entirely new for you with hints can have a more significant impact than answering something you know directly without hints.\n\n2)Prepare for HR rounds properly if you are targeting Non-Tech roles, mainly defending why you decided to go for that role. Attend the PPTs for Non-Tech roles if you are targeting them and read their job descriptions thoroughly, it brings clarity to your answers.\n\n3)The Internship process is very random. People may get into roles they don\u2019t want or are not being paid according to their expectations. I have seen it with my seniors as well as my batchmates. You can apply for off-campus opportunities if you don\u2019t get into one of the roles of your preference. You have six or seven months before you join your company; there\u2019s sufficient time. Try to maintain your calm and schedule. It can be frustrating at times but trust your preparation. Believe in yourself and everything eventually, will go in the right direction\n\n4)Saying NO is always a better option than answering absolutely wrong answers, and it will not hurt your overall evaluation believe me. This is what I have experienced.\n\n7) Kindly attach your resume. What are some of the major points that would be valid to mention in your CV while targeting this profile? (any specific suggestions you would like to make?)\n\nMajor Points\n\n1) Corporate internship in a well-known Financial Services Company\n\n2) Research internship in one of the Top 10 Management schools in India\n\n3) Being a student with a specialization in Financial Program\n\n4) Participation in finance related Competitions"

I\u2019m a Computer Science and Engineering student enrolled in its dual degree course. I am a boarder of Rajendra Prasad Hall of Residence. I\u2019m from Kolkata and when I\u2019m not doing something productive (which is a lot of time), you\u2019ll probably find me watching anime or playing soccer. That\u2019s about it! Nice to meet you.\n\nHow did you get into Salesforce? What was the selection procedure?\n\nAfter resume shortlisting, the first round was a coding test. The next round for those shortlisted from the coding test was a technical interview round. For me, there was a personnel change halfway through, and the interview changed from a live coding round to a resume grilling and technical concept testing one. After some time, there was another personnel change, some non-technical questions were asked, and that was it. The entire interview lasted more than 1 and a half hours. The details of the interview are elaborated on below. After a few hours, I got a call about my selection.\n\nIn the first part of the interview, I was given a problem statement on a live coding platform. The interviewer was friendly, and he encouraged questions and clarified doubts, many of which were also hints in disguise. The problem was a practical one, and they mainly wanted to test the approach through which I arrived at the correct solution. It was based on an advanced implementation of binary search. The trick was figuring out which solution could be implemented practically with data sizes equal to any practical amount available in the real world.\n\nI started with a naive approach, discussed why it was not practical due to time-complexity issues and then arrived at binary search. After we agreed on the algorithm, I was asked to implement and run a full working code, taking my own inputs to check for all corner cases. Once they were satisfied with my code, there was a personnel change and they moved on to the resume grilling part.\n\nThey gave me the option to choose a project/internship from my resume and elaborate on every intricate detail. They listened to it carefully, understood everything fundamentally, and there were questions and counter-questions. Based on their understanding of my work in that project, they moved ahead with some basic OOPs design choice questions like inheritance, abstraction, encapsulation, which to use in which use cases, pros and cons of different design choices, and so on. They also asked for solutions if a code base is in a different language than what is to be used for a different purpose which uses that code base. Finally, they asked what happens if two programs try to access the same file at the same time and how to write code so as not to cause any conflicts.\n\nAfter the final personnel change, they asked some non-technical questions like, \u201cState an example from your previous experiences where there was a difference of opinion between team members and what part you played in resolving it.\u201d They also asked what the one thing was that I learned at my previous internships that I most definitely want to carry on in my future experiences. Overall, the entire interview process was enriching and enticing.\n\nHow to prepare for them?\n\nI revised my OS and OOPs concepts from my CS slides, which were all-encompassing. Geeksforgeeks also has some quick revision and common interview questions on the same, but I think the CS slides make the fundamentals much more stronger. For the coding test, CP is not needed as much as being able to solve leetcode and interviewbit hard questions. Although, CP does definitely add a certain level of confidence and ability boost.\n\nFor the live coding round, having clear DSA concepts and practising common interview questions should be enough, considering the person has enough skills to think, implement, debug, and reach the final solution of leetcode and interviewbit hard problems by himself. For the non-technical questions, just googling some common HR questions should do. All in all, a calm mind is necessary during the interview for your presence of mind to click in as that is most essential in dealing with all scenarios, even if they are unprecedented and unforeseen.\n\nWhat difficulties did you face while preparing for this Company/Profile? How did you overcome this problem?\n\nI was never a CP expert and hence I had a slow start in catching up. I talked to a bunch of my 4 year BTech friends who had their internships last year about how they dealt with this and gathered enough confidence that focussing just on mastering every topic from interviewbit and leetcode should give me a solid backbone.\n\nBeing from CS I had proper understanding of the algorithms and concepts from before so it was relatively easier to catch up on practicing enough to solve medium and hard problems by myself. Initially, when I struggled and wasted a lot of time and still couldn\u2019t solve the hard problems, my friends advised me to spend fixed amount of time in thinking, analyze the thought, read the editorial, try implementing it, use that idea in another problem, that\u2019s how I mastered the hard problems.\n\nAccording to you, who should ideally apply for this job?\n\nI think every single person should apply for this job, or at least aim to. Salesforce is a really versatile company and accepts interns from diverse backgrounds provided they satisfy their technical requirements.\n\nAny specific advice you want to give to the junta sitting for internships this year.\n\nIt\u2019s never too late to start coding, sit down, treat it like a game and keep levelling up non-stop.\n\nWhat are some of the major points you think would be valid to mention in your CV while targeting this profile?(any specific suggestions you would like to make?\n\nI don\u2019t know the metrics they use for resume shortlisting, I can only speculate. I think adding any projects or internships adds real value to the resume, no matter how small, even course projects work. Adding relevant coursework, languages, or toolkits most comfortable with is a must. Lastly, do feel free to reach out to me on LinkedIn/messenger/instagram for any further doubts you may have.

        "content": "FORESIGHT(2023): Summer Internship at Salesforce| Atulya Sharma|\n\n--\n\nListen\n\n1) Brief Introduction\n\nHi, I am Atulya Sharma, a 3rd Year student from the department of Computer Science and Engineering, enrolled in its BTech program.\n\n2) How did you get into Salesforce? What was the selection procedure?\n\nOnline Coding Round:\n\n3 Questions\n\n- 2 easy, 1 easy-medium (< Codeforces div 2C level)\n\n- Did all 3 to get shortlisted for interviews\n\nRound 1: Coding Interview\n\nI was asked a few easy string manipulation questions to solve on an online IDE. Did all of them. Round 2: HR\n\nA lot of questions were asked from my CV, especially from a course term project (Software Engineering Lab). I was also asked why I wanted to join Salesforce, what I knew about Salesforce, etc.\n\nOverall I wasn\u2019t asked anything hard. The standard of questions drop a lot after day 1 in my experience. Compared to day 1 companies I was shortlisted in, (NK Securities, Sprinklr, Nutanix), these rounds were way simpler.\n\n3) How to prepare for them?\n\nFor SDE profiles, one must be somewhat experienced with CP. I\u2019d say at least reach specialist on codeforces / 4 stars on codechef. Have few projects. Won\u2019t help with any coding rounds/ tech interviews, but could help in HR rounds if the interviewer finds them intriguing. Most of the time during the HR interview, I was just answering questions related to my project.\n\n4) What difficulties did you face while preparing for this Company/Profile? How did you overcome this problem?\n\nI wasn\u2019t actually preparing specifically for Salesforce. I was targeting systems roles in quant firms. But yes, SDE roles for product companies were on my cards. I faced a lot of difficulty in raising my rating on codeforces, since I started CP after 4th semester (2.5 months before coding rounds). I did have some knowledge of algorithms thanks to the 3rd semester\u2019s algorithms course. Could not really escape this problem. It just takes time. Do NOT expect to be an expert right away at CP or at anything. It takes time.\n\nI was also really short on time to cover all topics. The only solution I had was to trim advanced topics. I completely skipped segment trees, advanced dp, tries, etc, since those are rarely asked in intern tests. These topics are asked in some companies though. (Ex: Google, sometimes in Quant firms, etc). Instead of learning new things in the nick of time, it\u2019s better to become proficient at things one has already studied about.\n\nI was quite slow in problem solving. As the tests are timed, this is a huge problem. I usually practiced the whole day and gave whatever contests were held at night. Doing timed contests is a sure way to develop speed.\n\n5) According to you, who should ideally apply for this job?\n\nAnyone targeting SDE roles in product companies. Also if you want to chill in your final year; Salesforce usually offers PPO at a higher rate than most other product companies, although it selects less interns from a single place (7 from KGP).\n\n6) Any specific advice you want to give to the junta sitting for internships this year.\n\nThere is no vacation for you peeps :)\n\nKGP has a lot of students sitting for internships, which means a lot of competition. Study thoroughly instead of trying to do everything, but I\u2019m sure you are painfully aware of this after the recent end\n\ninstead of trying to do everything, but I\u2019m sure you are painfully aware of this after the recent end semester.\n\nGive contests regularly as mentioned before. Do interviewbit / leetcode properly to get practice. Also keep in mind that only doing CP won\u2019t help you, since you need to have proper practice in all topics. If you don\u2019t have any projects, it\u2019s fine. Your first priority should be to get good enough to first clear those coding rounds.\n\n7) Kindly attach your resume. What are some of the major points you think would be valid to mention in your CV while targeting this profile?(any specific suggestions you would like to make?\n\nMake profile specific CVs if targeting multiple profiles. Do not try to cram everything like many do (even I did).\n\nFor ex: if you have an SDE profile, there is no use trying to write every POR you have ever got, which is not even remotely related to software, although being a member of kdag/koss/cgs etc is different, those are very worth writing in the CV imho.\n\nDo NOT have anything on the CV which you are not sure about / not well acquainted with. In case you are asked the same thing from the CV and you are unable to answer, it is safe to assume that you will most probably be rejected. Not being able to answer something from your CV is a HUGE problem, just don\u2019t write it in the first place."

        "content": "FORESIGHT(2023): Summer Internship at BCG| Dipanki Mukherjee Pabreja|\n\n--\n\nListen\n\n1) Brief Introduction\n\nHi, I am Dipanki Mukherjee Pabreja, a pre-final year student from the Civil Engineering department, and I shall be Interning at Boston Consulting Group this summer.\n\n2) How did you get into BCG? What was the selection procedure?\n\nThe following procedure is followed:\n\nCV Selection is the most critical aspect, as it is during this round that most of the candidates are eliminated. Around 1 CV is shortlisted for every 20 candidates.\n\nAfter CV Shortlisting, during our selections, two rounds took place. A project manager took my 1st round of Interview. This round generally involves the interviewer asking a guesstimate or a case question followed by a few HR questions.\n\nI was asked a guesstimate based on a topic that aligned with my interest that the Interview and I had talked about while introducing myself, followed by that a few HR Questions were asked like \u201cWhat was the most challenging thing I have faced\u201d.\n\nIn the third and final round, a partner takes the Interview, which mainly involves a case question. I was asked about a profitability case.\n\n3) How to prepare for them?\n\nCV Making:\n\nThe first thing one needs to do to get a shortlist for the interview rounds is to create a stellar CV. Consult firms look for spikes ( high points) in your CV. This can range from having a POR to attending various conferences, being part of international events, case studies or Internships.\n\nIt is essential to utilise your summers properly so that you can get hold of imminent internships or even apply for certificates like FRM/CFA. This gives the interviewer an idea that you are an all-rounder with diversified interests and experience.\n\nA POR gives the understanding you have been accountable and have managed different works in the past and have excelled in most of them. One also needs to maintain a decent CGPA. On average, 2\u20133 spikes are enough to get a shortlist.\n\nPast work in areas similar to that in consulting also helps as it showcases that you have previous experience and have successfully implemented and showcased your work and understand how client-facing roles work.\n\nGuesstimates and Case Questions:\n\nVarious resources are available on the net for the guesstimate and case questions. I would suggest thoroughly going through the books \u201cCase Interview Cracked\u201d and \u201cDay 1.0: The Finance and Consulting Interview Guide\u201d. All the available cases must be practiced with another person rather than going through them alone.\n\nThis gives an understanding of how one needs to think while a person is asking a question and if you can communicate your solution as effectively as it has been chalked out inside your mind.\n\nThus, try to find peers interested in similar profiles and start practicing cases with them from various sources to become proficient in all existing cases.\n\nCV Review and HR Preparation:\n\nPrepare your CV well, as the interviewer might also ask to explain certain aspects of your CV. Many times guesstimates and case questions are asked based on the things written on the CV.\n\nIt is essential to prepare HR Questions beforehand as well. Consultants prefer a structured answer, so one must answer these questions accordingly. It is easier if one has already practiced early, so one is not surprised by the questions asked.\n\n4) What difficulties did you face while preparing for this Company/Profile? How did you overcome this problem\n\nTrying out guesstimates and case questions might become a bit daunting the first time. Various kinds of cases are there, and it gets difficult to understand how to structure them and solve such questions.\n\nHence it is essential that, alongside practicing with peers, you take constant help from seniors who have gone through the process so that they can point out the shortcomings and help you figure out a way to solve such questions.\n\nHave your CV Reviewed by multiple people to mitigate any errors; as stated before, CV Shortlisting is taken very seriously by consulting firms.\n\n5) According to you, who should ideally apply for this job?\n\nConsultants solve problems for firms; hence if you enjoy solving problems and chalking out practical solutions, this job is for you.\n\nConsulting is the way to go if a person wants to experience all different industries. It allows you to work out solutions for various firms and help them manage themselves better, giving an idea of numerous industries in a brief time period.\n\nConsulting also involves extensive working hours and travel, so one should choose accordingly.\n\n6) Any specific advice you want to give to the junta sitting for internships this year?\n\nTry to find where your interests lie and prepare for that profile accordingly. Various factors come into play during the internship season, so prepare your best and do not be disheartened by any setback.\n\nOne might feel uncomfortable even during the preparation hence try to be with like-minded people and have the support of everyone.\n\nTry to be optimistic; in the end, things will always go well. Best of luck."

        "content": "FORESIGHT(2023): Summer Internship at LEK Consulting| Diya Sarkar|\n\n--\n\nListen\n\n1) Brief Introduction\n\nHello! My name is Diya Sarkar. I am a 3rd-year undergraduate student from the Department of Chemical Engineering, enrolled in its BTech course. I\u2019m a boarder of Mother Teresa Hall of Residence. I am a debater and former governor at the Debating Society, and a former member of Kharagpur Data Analytics Group. I currently reside in Mumbai. I will be joining LEK Consulting as a Summer Associate this summer.\n\n2) How did you get into LEK? What was the selection procedure?\n\nThe selection procedure started off with CV shortlisting, followed by a buddy round, a few rounds of case interviews and finally a personal interview.\n\nFor the CV shortlisting, LEK (like other consulting profiles) generally looks for \u201cspikes\u201d in your CV \u2014 this looks like excellent PoRs, CGPA, extra-curriculars, internships or projects. The more spikes your CV has, the better the chances for getting shortlisted. It is not necessary to have prior consulting experience (I did not have any), however internships at well-known companies (brand names) are valued.\n\nAfter getting shortlisted, you are assigned a \u201cbuddy\u201d from LEK, with whom you collaboratively solve cases and learn how to prepare for the interviews.\n\nPost the buddy round, there are a few rounds of case interviews, where you\u2019ll generally be asked cases of three types \u2014 guesstimates, profitability or market entry. In my instance, my PI and case interview were combined \u2014 so I answered questions based on my previous work experience, why I wanted to join consulting (and LEK specifically) and other standard HR questions followed by a case problem. This is to say that these rounds can be flexible and are different for different people, so make sure you keep an open mind and are able to adapt accordingly.\n\n3) How to prepare for them?\n\nThere are two kinds of interviews you need to prepare for \u2014 case and personal interviews.\n\nPreparing for cases is similar to preparing for any technical role \u2014 you go through casebooks and solve cases and you watch videos of mock case interviews. The unique thing about solving cases is that it\u2019s important to solve cases with a partner \u2014 in this way, one of you can take the role of the interviewer and the other of the interviewee and you can get a better learning experience. You can refer to ISB, IITM or IIMA for their casebooks. Each casebook has a slightly different framework, so make sure you stick to what works best for you and become really well versed in that framework. Apart from that, you can refer to the Youtube channel Case Interviews Cracked to see how case interviews generally go. Another important aspect of case interviews is that the interviewer is testing your ability to think logically \u2014 so it\u2019s okay if you don\u2019t get to the final answer right away! You should be very communicative with your interviewer at every step through your case-solving process so that they know how you\u2019re thinking.\n\nFor personal interviews, you should be able to explain your past work and your interest in joining the firm/field very well. Consultants are expected to be good at communication, so make sure you\u2019re able to express yourself clearly and concisely when answering these questions. You can refer to the book \u201cHow to Answer the 64 Toughest Interview Questions\u201d (don\u2019t be intimidated by the name) for some standard HR questions.\n\n4) What difficulties did you face while preparing for this Company/Profile? How did you overcome this problem?\n\nI initially faced difficulties in properly communicating with my interviewer while solving cases. I think this was because I had a very results oriented approach \u2014 that I should somehow arrive at the right answer. This meant I rushed and was not always clear about my process and was even more so unable to communicate it. It\u2019s important to be very thorough and go step by step while solving cases. Treat your interviewer like your collaborator \u2014 they want to help you reach the right answer. When starting out, it\u2019s okay to take a lot of time to solve a case; if that means your fundamentals are clear. My main takeaways are: don\u2019t hesitate in asking for clarifications and don\u2019t rush to the final solution.\n\n5) According to you, who should ideally apply for this job?\n\nI don\u2019t think there\u2019s a specific \u201ctype\u201d of person who is ideal for consultancy. Broadly, you should be open to learning new things in various fields and be willing to take a lot of accountability and initiative. Apart from that, being expressive and good at communication are important. However, I think the latter skills can be learnt and anyone willing to do so should go ahead and apply.\n\n6) Any specific advice you want to give to the junta sitting for internships this year.\n\nMy main piece of advice would be to keep reaching out to seniors for professional as well as personal advice during the intern season. CDC is a difficult and confusing process and you don\u2019t want to lose out on any opportunity due to lack of information. Your seniors have probably gone through exactly what you\u2019re going through right now and have more perspective given they\u2019re now on the other side. Remember that it\u2019s always better to ask a silly doubt and clear it, than to keep having silly misconceptions. I personally aspired for and also did much better than I ever would have if I were on my own because of the guidance and encouragement given to me by some amazing seniors.\n\n7) What are some of the major points you think would be valid to mention in your CV while targeting this profile?(any specific suggestions you would like to make?)\n\nClearly explain your previous work experience such that even someone who doesn\u2019t necessarily have a lot of knowledge on the subject can understand what you did. The STAR framework is useful for figuring out a general structure for your CV. It\u2019s worth it to put in extra time to format your CV well \u2014 1 page long, minimum whitespace, no grammatical or spelling errors. This is especially true for non-tech roles such as consultancy, where the first step is generally a CV shortlist."

        "content": "FORESIGHT(2023): Summer Internship at Adobe| Shaurabh Tiwari|\n\n--\n\nListen\n\nIntroduction:\n\nHello everyone, I am Shaurabh Tiwari. I am a fourth-year student, pursuing a Dual Degree course in the Department of Mechanical Engineering with specialization in Manufacturing Science and Engineering. In the 2022 CDC Internship Drive, I got a Research Internship offer from Adobe Research for a duration of 12 weeks.\n\nHow did you get into Adobe? What was the selection procedure?\n\nThe selection procedure started with a written test followed by the Interview. The written test consisted of questions from Probability and Statistics, Basic OOPs, DBMS, some general Aptitude questions, and two Medium Level programming questions (Difficulty Level: 1300 to 1700) related to Data Structures and Algorithms.\n\nThere was one Interview round for the students who cleared the written round. In my case, the Interview started with the CV Discussion, In which I explained the projects mentioned in the CV. While discussing the projects the interviewer did ask some questions related to basic ML, DL, and basic mathematics behind them. After that, we had a 15-minute discussion on a research paper, which I had read in the past. The interview ended with some basic HR questions to test your teamwork skills.\n\nHow to prepare for them?\n\nYou need to have a good grasp of Machine Learning and Deep Learning, and for that, Coursera ML and DL specializations can be a good starter, also blogs at Towards Data Science will be good for those who prefer reading over watching videos. It will be preferred to have at least one good project/internship on your CV for a better understanding of the domain and also it\u2019ll help as a starter for discussion during the interview. If you have time I\u2019ll suggest looking into NLP or Computer Vision domain.\n\nFor the written round a good grasp of competitive programming will be required for that try solving problems on any competitive programming platform like Leetcode, Codeforces, Codechef, etc. Also, good knowledge of Probability and Statistics will be required, for this solving Heard on the Street or 50 Challenging Problems will be more than enough. Try to have some basic knowledge of OOPs.\n\nWhat difficulties did you face while preparing for this Profile? How did you overcome this problem?\n\nThe major issue here is you need to have knowledge of many different domains. To clear the written round a good knowledge of Data Structures Algorithms will be needed along with Probability and Statistics. For interviews, knowledge of Machine Learning and Deep Learning Algorithms will be required. Also, you need to have some good projects in this domain for your CV to stand out among the other candidates. Keeping a hand on all these things at once is very tough but not impossible. The strategy which worked for me is to divide the duration for each task and prepare for one task at a time while keeping a fixed revision schedule for the things which I\u2019ve already learned. In this way, things will not feel like a burden. Try to participate regularly in competitive programming contests on any platform.\n\nAccording to you, who should ideally apply for this job?\n\nFor anyone who likes brainstorming to find new and unresearched problems in the world and wants to explore the difference between academic and industrial research fields, this is an ideal opportunity for him. Also If you like working with the newest technologies and have a hunger for exploring the latest inventions and technology advancements, then you should apply for this.\n\nAny specific advice you want to give to the junta sitting for internships this year?\n\nPreparing for internships can be a stressful and competitive process, but it\u2019s important to keep a few things in mind. Firstly, remember that an internship is just a small part of your long and promising career ahead. Even if you don\u2019t secure your desired position, it doesn\u2019t define your capabilities or future success. Secondly, surround yourself with a supportive friend circle who can help you practice and conduct mock interviews. Their feedback and encouragement can be invaluable during this time. Additionally, luck can play a role in the selection process, so don\u2019t be disheartened if things don\u2019t go your way initially. Remember, there\u2019s no single right path to success, and each person\u2019s journey is unique. Be resilient, stay focused, and prioritize your happiness. Don\u2019t let the preparedness or success of others affect your self-confidence. Trust in your abilities, give your best, and success will come your way.\n\nWhat are some of the major points you think would be valid to mention in your CV while targeting this profile? (any specific suggestions you would like to make?)\n\nCV is an essential document that highlights your skills, experiences, and accomplishments. Here are some points which I think will help your cv to stand out:"

        "content": "FORESIGHT(2023): Summer Internship at Adobe| Divyansh Raghuwanshi|\n\n--\n\nListen\n\nIntroduction:\n\nI am Divyansh Raghuwanshi, a 3rd-year undergraduate student from the Department of Electronics and Electrical Communication Engineering at IIT Kharagpur. In the 2022 CDC Internship Drive I received a Research Internship offer from Adobe Research.\n\nHow did you get into Adobe? What was the selection procedure?\n\nThe selection process for Adobe Research consisted of one online test and one round of interview:\n\nOnline Test:\n\nThe online test was held on HackerRank and was around one and a half hours long. It was divided into five sections: the first four were MCQ-based and contained a total of 16 MCQs, including four each from Linear Algebra, Probability and Statistics, Computer Science Fundamentals, and Puzzles, the final section contained two coding questions (which were of an easy to medium difficulty). You needed to solve both coding questions correctly and perform well in MCQs in order to get through.\n\nInterview Round:\n\nThere was only one round of interview, which was around 45 minutes long. I was given a puzzle to solve at the beginning, followed by a probability question, and lastly one DSA question related to Multi-Source BFS was asked. You can expect questions from Data Structures and Algorithms, Linear Algebra, Probability and Statistics. Later on, the interview mainly revolved around my resume, there was a discussion about the projects mentioned in the resume, after this the interview concluded.\n\nHow to prepare for them?\n\nFor Coding Test Round:\n\nI would suggest to start practising DSA questions as early as possible, for practise you can use LeetCode or GeeeksforGeeks, and you should try to participate in contests regularly and upsolve, as this would really help you to solve questions in a timed environment, in the last one month to get the idea about interview questions you can practise questions on InterviewBit.\n\nPuzzles and probability problems were not very difficult, these can be prepared from GeeksforGeeks. Fifty Challenging Problems in Probability is another resource you can use to get a better understanding of the majority of probability problems. I didn\u2019t prepared much for CS fundamentals like OOPS, OS, DBMS, I just went through some of the blogs for these topics, though I would suggest you to prepare well for OOPS as it is being asked in many companies online test round and interviews as well.\n\nFor Interview Round:\n\nDuring the interview, try to be calm and composed and answer the questions honestly and confidently. Also, prepare a nice introduction beforehand to start well. You should try to find the most frequently asked interview questions before sitting for any company\u2019s interview, this will give you a decent idea of the questions you will be asked and will allow you to prepare for them appropriately. You should be very well prepared about all the points, especially the projects you put in your resume. It\u2019s better to avoid putting the things you are less confident about, as there may be cross-questions about anything they find interesting.\n\nHaving good technical projects is always desirable, as it boosts your chances. A good project related to NLP or Computer Vision would enhance your resume considerably for this profile, as most of the projects in Adobe Research are related to these fields. Most of the times, at the end of the interview, the interviewer might ask if you have any questions for him/her. So I would suggest to prepare some questions for the interviewer based on the company, as it would show your interest towards the company and that particular profile.\n\nWhat difficulties did you face while preparing for this Profile? How did you overcome this problem?\n\nAs I was preparing for both Software and Data profile, so there were too many things to prepare. To overcome this, I asked for advice from some of my friends and seniors which really helped me strategically plan my preparation, and working on it consistently throughout the summers helped me prepare well for the Internship process. I would advise, whenever you are having some difficulty regarding the preparation try to talk to your seniors or your batchmates who are also aiming for the same profile this will really help you overcome that problem.\n\nAccording to you, who should ideally apply for this job?\n\nAnyone who has a keen interest in the field of NLP or Computer Vision, and wants to innovate something in this field should apply for this internship.\n\nAny specific advice you want to give to the junta sitting for internships this year?\n\nIf you are preparing for Data profile don\u2019t neglect DSA part, as even for Data profile most companies ask a good level of DSA questions in both online test round and interviews. For the interviews it is very important that while thinking about the problem\u2019s solution you think out loud, try to have a good discussion with the interviewer as it would help you to think in the correct direction.\n\nAll the best, Everyone!\n\nWhat are some of the major points you think would be valid to mention in your CV while targeting this profile? (any specific suggestions you would like to make?)\n\nFor this profile the most important part of the CV is the Projects and Internships section. Try to present your projects very well, as having a 1\u20132 nice projects related to the profile will definitely increase your chances of selection.\n\nAs you would be asked many questions related to your projects, prepare well for whatever you write in your CV."

        "content": "FORESIGHT(2023): Summer Internship at NK Securities & Google| Shrinivas Khiste|\n\n--\n\nListen\n\n1) Brief IntroductionHi, my name is Shrinivas Khiste. I am a fourth year undergraduate student from the Department of Computer Science and Engineering enrolled in its Dual Degree Programme. I am from Aurangabad, Maharashtra. For my internship, I had prepared for ML and Software roles. I had received an offer from Google and NK Securities. I chose NK over Google because the opportunity to learn at NK would be much more and if I wanted to shift to software roles later, I could do that too. You can contact me if you are interested in ML opportunities too. In CDC, I think the best role is the one from Adobe for ML. Microsoft is good too but there is a gender bias there.\n\n2) How did you get into NK Securities / Google ? What was the selection procedure?NK Securities: First there was a coding round that consisted of 2 questions with medium level CP problems. First question was an application of STL and the other was on Tree DP. Then during CDC Day 1 there were 2 interiew rounds, each lasting for about an hour. Both the rounds consisted of questions on CP, C++ Concepts, Maths Puzzles (with questions on probability) with increased difficulty in the second round. There was no HR round.\n\nGoogle: Google also started with a coding round with 2 questions. They had a time duration between which you could give the test anytime. The questions are sampled from a question bank. One question was easy and the other one more difficult. Google generally asks questions on DP and graphs. Then there were 2 rounds of interview. Interview rounds of Google are generally very easy. Both the rounds had basic question of STL in my case. But they do ask DP and Graphs sometimes. There was no HR round.\n\n3) How to prepare for them?For CP, I had taken the Algozenith course and solved Interview Bit problems. If you do not wish to take any course, then you can solve leet code problems and complete the Interview ladder. Codeforces contests are helpful to increase speed and debugging skills but the type of questions asked in coding rounds and CF contests differ a lot. C++ concepts can be revised by referring to the OOPs, OS slides from the course taught in KGP. They have sufficient detail if not more. GFG blogs can also be useful if you do not understand any concepts. The Algozenith course also covers these concepts well.For maths puzzles, questions from Brainstellar (upto medium level) and Heard on the street should be enough. Questions on probability are generally based on Expected Value calculations, Bayes theorem, etc. (Not on probability distribution). Questions on these can be found on GFG ( and Algozenith again :P).\n\n4) What difficulties did you face while preparing for this Company/Profile? How did you overcome this problem? I think the major barrier is practising CP. It can be disheartening sometimes as you are unable to solve problems initially. A good peer group where you can discuss problems can help. CP is a skill that comes with practise and a lot of it. Do not give up, you will eventually get better at it.\n\n5) According to you, who should ideally apply for this job?NK: Someone interested in core computer science concepts can consider applying for the systems roles at HFTs. For quant roles, people interested in maths, probability, ML can apply. HFTs are a high effort, high reward kind of job. So you should be ready for this kind of work. If you are confused between Software and HFT roles you should try HFTs (except for maybe Glean, Rubrik) as you will be able to learn a lot more here and shifting to a software role later will be easier too. Google: After the top software startups (Glean, Rubrik), Google is the best choice for a software role.\n\n6) Any specific advice you want to give to the junta sitting for internships this year.Stay confident and believe in yourself. Try to be interactive during interviews and do not panic. You can take a short break, maybe drink some water if you loose your calm. Regarding tips during preparation, we all practise CP. But some companies ask some extra things like APT ask implementation of Data Structures you learnt in Algo 1, Nutanix asks questions on Binary Trees, Linked Lists, etc and some other companies do too. For Google prepare DP and Graph well. Keep some time just before the interviews to revise concepts specific to companies you will be interviewing for.\n\n7) What are some of the major points you think would be valid to mention in your CV while targeting this profile?(any specific suggestions you would like to make?)Some important things to mention in the CV are CF Ratings, Kickstart Ranks or any other coding competitions. I did not have very good ranks but these will matter during selections in other HFTs too. Apart from them you should have one project that you can talk about. CSE students can add their course projects too.\n\nHere is my resume (I was preparing for ML roles too hence this not how a typical software role resume will look like (you do not need such projects in your resume for software roles))."

I am a 3rd year undergraduate in the department of Electronics and Electrical Communication Engineering. I will be doing my internship at Texas Instruments in the summer of 2023. I got this opportunity through the on-campus CDC internship drive.\n\n2) What was the selection procedure?\n\nThe selection procedure consisted of a CV submission, an online test, and an interview.\n\nThe test had five sections: a compulsory aptitude section and sections for each of the profiles, Analog, Digital, Embedded software, and Signal processing. Each of the sections had a mix of MCQs and numerical questions. Each section had a specified time limit, and one could not navigate between sections. Questions in the \u201cDigital\u201d section mainly focussed on static timing analysis, logic design, and the behavior of a given logic design under various input conditions, such as the number of clock pulses.\n\nIn the interview round, I was mainly asked about the projects mentioned in my CV. I was asked to explain the sequence of steps that I followed in each of them. Later I was asked some simple questions based on a logic design using given logic blocks. Throughout the interview, always think aloud and let the interviewer know your thought process.\n\n3) How to prepare for them?\n\nI would highly recommend taking the Digital electronics course by Prof. Gautam Saha or going through his NPTEL lectures. It covers almost everything needed for the Digital profile. One can ace the selection tests by simply practicing the problems in the book by M. Morris Mano that is followed in the above course. I also recommend learning the basics of Verilog by following the lectures of Prof. Indranil Sengupta and the tutorial on asic-world.com. Using Verilog, one can implement and simulate all the digital logic elements designed in the digital electronics course. For the topics of static timing analysis, I recommend going through the second chapter on vlsi-expert.com.\n\nAlthough the topics of computer architecture are not much touched upon during the selection procedure, I recommend going through the lectures of Prof. Onur Motlu (for the sake of motivation) and the book that is followed in those lectures, Introduction to Computing Systems by Yale Patt and Sanjay Patel. Those interested can also go through free courses on computer architecture in Coursera and MITOCW.\n\n4) What are some of the major points you think would be valid to mention in your CV while targeting this profile?\n\nIn my CV, I mentioned my work in KRSSG and a self-project based on digital electronics. During my interview, I was asked to briefly explain the steps I followed in each of them. Hence it is important to mention only those projects in the CV that one clearly understands.\n\n5) According to you, who should ideally apply for this role?\n\nAnyone planning to pursue a career in core electronics can apply.\n\n6) Any specific advice you want to give to the junta sitting for internships this year.\n\nThe CV submission for the internship drive starts a month before the start of the autumn semester, so plan your CV preparation accordingly. During the interview, as I said before, it is essential to keep thinking out loud, i.e., letting the interviewer know your chain of thought. Remember, the interviewer is on your side! They are only trying to help you. Also, get enough rest, and stay hydrated.\n\nAll the best!"

        "content": "FORESIGHT(2023): Summer Internship at Texas Instruments| Tarang Sur Chaudhury|\n\n--\n\nListen\n\nBrief Introduction\n\nHello, I am Tarang Sur Chaudhury, a 3rd year Btech student from the Department of Electronics and Electrical Communication Engineering. I received an offer from Texas Instruments for a Digital Design internship last year.\n\nHow did you get into Texas Instruments? What was the selection procedure?\n\nI secured this internship opportunity through the CDC campus internship drive. The selection procedure involves a screening test followed by an interview. The screening test was objective type and tested the applicants broadly on topics corresponding to the roles offered \u2014 Analog Design, Digital Design, Signal Processing, and Embedded Systems, along with a mandatory section of Aptitude type questions. One gets shortlisted for the role-specific interviews depending on their performance in the corresponding sections (and aptitude section) only. If someone applies for more than one profile, they would simply have to attempt all the sections that they applied for \u2014 and may also get shortlisted for multiple profiles. I had applied for all of them and got shortlisted for both the Digital Design and Signal Processing roles. I was offered the Digital Design internship immediately after the interview, which is why I didn\u2019t get to appear for the Signal Processing interview. However, they might finalise the offers at the end of the day, which can result in multiple offers being made \u2014 however you may only choose a single role for your internship.\n\nHow to prepare for them?\n\nThe screening test primarily focuses on judging the strength of your fundamentals. Digital Electronic Circuits (4th sem EC course) is the definitive preparatory course one needs for the Digital Design profile \u2014 would also recommend Digital Design by M. Morris Mano. The questions were mostly based on logic gates, K-Maps, simple circuits like adders and ALUs. There were some basic questions from Computer Architecture related to cache and pipelining as well.I was not very good at Signals and Systems (getting shortlisted for the Signal Processing interview was a pleasant surprise), however the questions in the test were mostly based on fundamentals like Fourier analysis of signals and LTI systems.\n\nGuide to refer : CDC Guide for E&ECE Core companies\n\nThe interview experience was quite unique. It went on for 50 minutes, but didn\u2019t really feel that long, and definitely didn\u2019t feel like an \u201cinterview\u201d \u2014 it was more like a conversation about interesting problems and how to solve them. One key takeaway for me was that the interviewer is completely ok with you having no idea about a particular question \u2014 all they want to see is how you respond to being dropped into unknown territory, how you use your existing knowledge to try to decompose this new challenge into smaller problems that you know how to solve. Even if you\u2019re unable to make any sense of it, they provide crucial hints to steer you towards the solution, so do interact with your interviewer and illustrate your whole thought process.\n\nWhat difficulties did you face while preparing for this Company /Profile? How did you overcome this problem?\n\nI am reasonably comfortable with interviews. The screening test was actually the toughest part for me. DEC was a course I thoroughly enjoyed in my 4th semester, so the questions played to my strengths. The problem is that I am bad at test taking itself, I always seem to get my time management wrong, eventually end up rushing at the end and scoring well below what I should have. I was nervous beyond measure while taking this test as well, but somehow managed to hold my nerves and was able to answer most of the questions that I knew. I expect the average JEE-qualified reader to be better than I am at taking MCQ tests, which is why I should offer some advice for the interview, since it might be a first time experience for many.The golden rule is to not let the room plunge into awkward silence. The interviewer asks a question, and you really have no clue about the solution. Standing mute in front of them for five minutes and thinking about it is not really going to help \u2014 the interviewer is unsure of whether you\u2019re actually thinking about the problem, whether you\u2019re just too stunned to speak or if you are daydreaming. It is okay to take your time and think, but do let the room know what you are thinking about, what is your exact approach, because the interviewer cannot read your mind. They will eventually drop a hint and guide your analysis, and might even credit your unconventional approach. Communication is key. Again, as I said previously, they don\u2019t expect you to know everything, and they will judge you based on how you handle new challenges.\n\nAccording to you, who should ideally apply for this job?\n\nApplicants need to have a strong fundamental understanding of the domain they are applying for. Understandably, it is much easier for EC/EE people who already have completed relevant courses.\n\nAny specific advice you want to give to the junta sitting for internships this year.\n\nCompared to software, the number of opportunities in core is significantly less. A very lucrative option for many would be to prepare for a software profile during the summer break. However, it should not prevent anyone with a genuine love for their core subjects from applying to Texas Instruments, or even other core profiles. If I am being very honest, it does not even require one to prepare a lot in terms of actual content. All they have to do is back their strengths and be up to date with the relevant coursework.\n\nA very real challenge for some of the candidates would be if they decided to conduct in-person interviews this time around. I think I have already talked a lot about how to deal with an interview, it\u2019s all about having a good mindset when you walk into the room. Don\u2019t worry so much, you got this!\n\nWhat are some of the major points you think would be valid to mention in your CV while targeting this profile?\n\nMention relevant coursework. That\u2019s basically it \u2014 they really don\u2019t care about PoRs or projects (I didn\u2019t have any projects or PoRs to mention in my resume anyway \u2014 that should tell you how much they matter). Your CGPA might play a role, 8.5+ is always a bonus. You will mostly be judged on your interview performance and test results."

        "content": "FORESIGHT(2023): Summer Internship at Reliance-Jio| Susnata Biswas|\n\n--\n\nListen\n\n1) Brief Introduction\n\nHello everyone, I am Susnata Biswas, a final year undergraduate from the Department of Electrical Engineering, enrolled in its B.Tech course. I will be interning as a Software Developer at Reliance-Jio in the summer of 2023. This blog includes my CP background, preparation strategy, and experience in CDC codingrounds & interviews. I have been a huge follower of this CDC-blog series by SWG & I\u2019ll try to include all minor helpful details regarding the CDC internship drive at KGP, so yeah, this is going to be quite long!\n\n2) How did you get into Reliance? What was the selection procedure?\n\nReliance-Jio came for the first time to hire interns. Generally, they arrive for the Placement Session only. It was a Day-5 company. So,the selection process was easy and quite straightforward. It consisted of 1 coding round and 3 rounds of interviews. All the interview rounds were based on the CV and HR-related questions.In the coding round, 2 basic questions were asked. One was related to the Pascal triangle and the other was a basic implementation of a 2-pointer. The questions are at a level of CF div2 B in the sense implementation, but not as AdHoc as generally asked in Codechef or Codeforces. Anyone with 2\u20133 months of good practice in Interview Bit & Leetcode can handle this.\n\nAround 40\u201345 students got shortlisted for final interviews. I don\u2019t know why they kept 3 rounds of the same type of interviews. No coding questions were asked in any of the interviews. My CV had plenty of research projects and corporate internships related to Machine Learning and Deep Learning. They continuously asked for brief descriptions of each project in each round. In the second interview, HR was quite impressed by one of my projects mentioned in my CV related to UAV path optimization with the integration of the Bees Algorithm. They went deep into it, asking how Bees Algorithms work, their drawbacks, and how the traveling salesman problem (TSP) can be modified using this. At the end of the interview, they asked whether I am interested in further pursuing this project. They always expect an optimistic answer to such a question so, if your answer is NO, then also give a diplomatic answer. The interview went very well. In the last round, they asked some general HR questions like \u201cWhy should we hire you?\u201d, \u201cYour weakness?\u201d, \u201cWhat qualities do you have?\u201dand stuff like that. The last question they asked me was to name 5 products of Jio company that I was using.\n\n3) How to prepare for them?\n\nBe thorough with all your DSA problem-solving skills. Interview Bit and Leetcode are possibly the best resources out there to prepare for coding rounds. Apart from coding it is essential to be familiar with your CV. You should be well-versed with what you have written in your CV. Generally, they ask you from the highlighted technical terms in your CV. Mentioning something you haven\u2019t done yet in your CV, creates a very bad impression on the interviewer, probably resulting in exclusion from further rounds. Companies that come after day 3 generally prefer your CV and projects rather than asking tough DSA questions. Brushing up my CV helped me to\n\nscore some additional brownie points in Jio interviews. Also, I participated in CF and Atcoder contests regularly which certainly developed my problem-solving skills, but I didn\u2019t focus a lot on those contests. Please go through this blog written by Shivansh Shukla (Graviton), a very good friend of mine, to get brief info about all the Day 1 companies.\n\n4) What difficulties did you face while preparing for this Company/Profile? How did you overcome this problem?\n\nThe difficulty with preparing for a profile like SDE is not the lack of resources but it\u2019s quite the opposite. There are too many resources to make a beginner puzzled as to where to even start. The best solution will be to focus on just one particular resource and trust it blindly and unless you can solve a good chunk of the single resource you started with, don\u2019t look to anything else as it will confuse you more. That\u2019s the strategy I followed and I would recommend Leetcode and solving Interview Bit for revising later on.\n\n5) According to you, who should ideally apply for this job?\n\nAnyone having good problem-solving skills and the ability to grasp things quickly, as things change fast in the software field and would need to adapt and be flexible enough to adapt to these changes.\n\n6) Any specific advice you want to give to the junta sitting for internships this year.\n\nFor preparation:\n\n\u25cf Practice CP.\n\n\u25cf Try to learn the basics of OOPs, Computer Networks, OS, and DBMS (less important).\n\n\u25cf Dev-related projects may help.\n\n\u25cf POR(s) are not at all necessary.\n\nFor Interview:\n\n\u25cf The best advice would be to stay confident and believe in yourself.\n\n\u25cf The interviewer mainly wants to judge how well you think and approach a problem.\n\n\u25cf It is very important that while thinking about the problem\u2019s solution, you think out loud.\n\n\u25cf Keep talking with the interviewer about your approach so that even if you go wrong, he can give you a hint to get you back on track.\n\nAlong with focusing on DSA, do put a heavy emphasis on one specific thing I can think of as of writing this \u2014 For many Day 1/2 SDE profiles, be good at what you do. Know as much as algorithms,languages, computer science theory, as possible. If you are going to start into the CDC process you\u2019ll realize that it is so biased and the luck factor plays an important role here. You will not be shortlisted even after giving an overwhelming performance in the coding tests and your friend will be shortlisted easily. Just forget about all those negative thoughts and enjoy your CDC process junta. Always remember \u201cKARMA always WORKS.\u201d\n\n7) What are some of the major points you think would be valid to mention in your CV while targeting this profile?(any specific suggestions you would like to make?)\n\nThough I am preparing for SDE, Quant & Data profile simultaneously, I made a single CV. But you can make separate CVs for different profiles.\n\nFor Software & Quant roles, you can mention projects related to Development, core CS theoretical projects done under any professor, FT(many people do it), and Data Science. You can also mention Google Kickstart ranks (under 1000 preferable), ICPC ranks (qualified for regionals could be the golden word of your CV), in general, Codeforces (please mention you have at least >1350), and Codechef (> 4*).\n\nFor a Data profile, you can look at my CV. It is very well written. For this profile, they generally expect at least 1\u20132 research projects and you should have a good command of Python, DBMS, and SQL. Please mention Python libraries that you know, in your CV. Onsite foreign projects under 100 QS-ranked universities enlighten your CV for this profile especially.\n\nIn general, you can mention JEE ranks, Olympiad achievements, Skills & Expertise, PORs (must for Consultancy profile), and Extracurricular activities (must for consultancy profile) for all the profiles."

I\u2019m Sravani Gopi, a fourth year undergraduate student of the department of Industrial and Systems Engineering. I will be interning at Hindustan Unilever Limited this summer as a Supply Chain Intern .\n\n2) How did you get into Hindustan Unilever Limited? What was the selection procedure?\n\nWe had to go through 4 brief set of tests that filtered out people at each level . First was a psychometric test and the later was a form that contained questions related to past experiences and what leadership means to that person and how the company\u2019s values align with those of anyone attempting the test. Third test was a video case study round which had basic supply chain case questions and one has to answer them within the time frame and in a concise and punctual manner which was tough as in my case I had to answer 4 questions and each question has very limited time to be answered and solved. But since I had good practice of cases and had good knowledge of supply chain concepts I made it through the round . The last round was obviously a personal interview where in my case the interviewer was very tough on my project which was supply chain related and also on my coursework information. He kept digging more and more onto minute details that I mentioned related to subjects or any technical term that I\u2019ve used and expected me to dwell more on the details that he asked . He also gave me an instant case and asked me to solve it given that I knew supply chain basics . The interviewer tried to overwhelm me with more and more questions and details but one should try to keep their cool and maintain good communication with the interviewer which I felt were detrimental for me to pass the last round .\n\n3) How to prepare for them?\n\nPreparation included practising cases with seniors and batchmates and revising basic concepts of supply chain which were covered in the course Logistics and Supply Chain Management of Industrial department. Else one can also take a good look at the book : Supply chain Management by Chopra and Meindl.\n\n4) What difficulties did you face while preparing for this Company/Profile? How did you overcome this problem\n\nFor me the main difficulty I faced in the preparation process was chalking out a good solving strategy for the video case study round . As one would be given only a minute or two to read and solve the question and close to 4 or 5 minutes to speak and walk through the answer . This was the toughest part as while practising with few practice questions myself I felt the difficulty in winding up my answer within the given time and keeping my answer short and precise. But practice made my answers better and concise .\n\n5) According to you, who should ideally apply for this job?\n\nIf you are someone who is very intrigued by how supply chains work and If your values align with HUL you definitely have a good go . Ps : HUL values leadership a lot ! In terms of CGPA one should maintain a minimum CGPA of 8 or above .\n\n6) Any specific advice you want to give to the junta sitting for internships this year.\n\n7) What are some of the major points you think would be valid to mention in your CV while targeting this profile?(any specific suggestions you would like to make?)"

My name is Hari G, I am a 4th year undergraduate student in the Department of Ocean Engineering and Naval Architecture enrolled in its Dual Degree course. I am a boarder of the Nehru Hall of Residence. In the past, I have worked on various interns and projects related to the field of Machine Learning & Data Science.\n\nHow did you get into Hindustan Unilever Limited ? What was the selection procedure?\n\nThere are 3 stages to the selection process :\n\n1. Google Form\n\n2. HireVue Test\n\n3. Interview\n\n1. Google Form :\n\nOnce you have applied in ERP with your CV, you will get a Google Form from the company that needs to be filled. It will have 5 sections (Your Basic Info, Your Achievements, Your Hobbies, Psychometric Questions, Reviewers). The answers to the questions is given in a subjective format with word limit of 150 characters.\n\n2. HireVue Test\n\nOnce you get past 1st round, you will be sent a test link in the name of HireVue Test. Details of the HireVue Test:\n\nTest Duration : 15mins\n\nTest Window : ~ 1 day\n\nQuestions : 3\n\nBreakdown : 1 min (for question narration) + 1 min (for thinking through the solution ) + 3mins (for answering the question)\n\n3. Interview\n\nOnce you clear the HireVue test, you will be notified about the interview. There is only 1 interview which lasts for ~30\u201340mins. Here questions were of 3 types : Department-related, CV-related, HR.\n\nHow to prepare for them?\n\n1. Google Form :\n\nWith this form, they look out for your character and credibility. There is no time limit for the form. So you should take time and answer each question as best as possible. Answer each question as exhaustive as possible. Make sure your answers aligns with the company\u2019s values (which you should go through and consider while writing your answers).\n\nIn case of reviewers, you are required to submit contact details of people who know best about you from internships such as your manager, your faculty advisors etc.,.\n\n2. HireVue Test\n\nEach question was from different domain. One of the questions was strategy-related, other two were more industry-related. To prepare for this test, going through the role and trying to have a general knowledge on the technologies and procedures related will help. Also, doing a bit of case study will help when it comes to strategy related questions.\n\n3. Interview\n\nGoing through your department courses will be very necessary since the questions start from there. If your department isn\u2019t related to the role, then refer one of the Mechanical Department courses (such as Thermodynamics / Fluid Mechanics).\n\nFor supply chain, you can go through the Supply Chain Management course slides from Industrial Engineering Department (In my case, I wasn\u2019t questioned on these concepts)\n\nTo prepare for HR questions, refer to Divyam Sharma\u2019s Medium articles and some general HR questions. The questions covered there were exhaustive enough. I would recommend to write answers for those questions and have it prepared in case you are not sure of your performance. Again, for these questions try to go through the job description and answer based on the requirements for the role.\n\nLink : https://medium.com/@divyamsharma_iitkgp\n\nDuring the entire interview, the aim is to ensure that the interviewer is always focused towards the answers. Therefore you should be confident in the interview and provide answers calmly and clearly.\n\nWhat difficulties did you face while preparing for this Company/Profile? How did you overcome this problem?\n\nIn my case, my department and my CV (ML-oriented) is not related to the role. Therefore during my interview, I was questioned on my ability to perform well in the role. The key is to convince the interviewer that you are capable enough of molding yourself to this type of role given how you have done the same in past (with your real-life experience).\n\nAccording to you, who should ideally apply for this job?\n\nIf you have a flair for management and collaborating with multiple teams is something you are interested in, then this is ideal for your role. This role isn\u2019t more technical in terms of requirement for hard skills.\n\nAny specific advice you want to give to the junta sitting for internships this year?\n\nThere is no set of rules for getting selected in this role as the selection process is more subjective from the start. Supply Chain Management roles primarily intake students from the Circuital / Industrial / Chemical / Mechanical Department. So if you don\u2019t belong to these departments, then apply for this role only as backup.\n\nJust to give a perspective, this year (2022\u201323), the intake of HUL has increased to 5 people from 1 person last year.\n\nTherefore if you don\u2019t get selected for this role, don\u2019t worry. There are multiple other companies with other roles and good offers in subsequent days.\n\nWhat are some of the major points you think would be valid to mention in your CV while targeting this profile? (any specific suggestions you would like to make?)\n\nIn Hindustan Unilever Limited, the selection program is called Unilever Leadership Internship Programme (ULIP) . For this role, internships and Position of Responsibility are valued equally. If you can justify yourself with work you have done in your internships and societies from a leadership standpoint ( such as by giving real-life examples for your communication skills) , that will be enough."

Basic knowledge of financial matters, even if it\u2019s not deep, is all they need. They\u2019re not expecting much out of the college students, they expect them to learn first.\n\n6) Any specific advice you want to give to the junta sitting for internships this year?\n\nIt\u2019s a fairly randomly drawn process to get an internship. You shouldn\u2019t give up hope, and you should try to do your best.\n\n7) What are some of the major points you think would be valid to mention in your CV while targeting this profile?\n\nDB takes a holistic approach while recruiting.\n\nSo if you\u2019ve done anything other than the curriculum, this would be an added advantage."

        "content": "FORESIGHT(2023): Summer Internship at Amex| Sagar Kumar Karn|\n\n--\n\nListen\n\n1) Brief Introduction\n\nI\u2019m Sagar Kumar Karn, a final-year undergraduate student of Economics at IIT Kharagpur. I am currently working at American Express as an Analyst Intern. I am a boarder of Patel Hall of Residence.\n\n2) How did you get into Amex? What was the selection procedure?\n\nI started exploring Data Science in my second year and became quite interested in this field. I pursued two research internships in this domain in my third year. One of them was at the Insitute of Technology and Business, Czech Republic, and another at the Centre for Analytical Finance. These internships helped me to gain a further understanding of this field.\n\nNow coming to the selection procedure, the test comprised of three sections namely Aptitude, Machine Learning, and Case Study. The first section had 20 MCQ questions on aptitude and basic Prob stats and had to be solved in 40 minutes. The questions were of CAT level and included puzzles, probability and statistics, etc.\n\nThe second section had 10 questions on ML and had to be done in 20 minutes. To get through this section you need to have a clear understanding of various ML algorithms and models. The questions were centered around Decision Trees, XGBoost, black box models, k nearest neighbors, etc.\n\nThe third section is a case study section where you are given a case and you are required to give an answer to a question. To arrive at the answer you have 50 questions at your disposal and you can unlock at max 25 of them. The fewer questions you unlock to get to the correct answer, the better your score is. You can attempt either or both of the second and third sections. The best of the two is taken into account. The first section is compulsory.\n\nNow coming to the interview, there were two interview rounds. The first round was mostly based on my knowledge of machine learning and deep learning. One of the questions in the first round was on how I was asked about how XGBoost works and what is boosting. The second round basically revolved around my resume and my previous internships and projects. The interviewer asked me to explain one of my projects and then after I was done, asked various cross questions on the same. It is therefore important to be thorough with the internships and projects that you mention in your resume because they can easily see through if have just written it but you don\u2019t have a basic understanding of the project.\n\n3) How to prepare for them?\n\nTo prepare for Probability and Statistics, \u201c50 Challenging Problems in Probability\u201d and \u201cHeard on the Street\u201d are great books. You can practice for the aptitude section from Brainstellar.\n\nFor machine learning and deep learning, it is important to have a basic understanding of different algorithms and models. One of the best resources to start off with Machine Learning is the course by Andrew NG for machine learning. For deep learning, Deep Learning Specialization on Coursera is a good resource. Other than that Stanford University courses such as CS230(Deep Learning), CS231n(Computer Vision), CS224n(Natural Language Processing), etc are also great courses to follow.\n\nOnce you are done with the theory do some self-projects to test your understanding and practical implementation of what you have learned.\n\n4) What difficulties did you face while preparing for this Company/Profile? How did you overcome this problem?\n\nOne of the basic difficulties I faced was that I did not take enough time to revise all the stuff before the interviews. I was preparing for both SDE roles and Analytics roles and had devoted more time to DSA, so had quite less time to revise Data Science topics. My advice to people prepping for both profiles is to keep enough time for the revision of these topics.\n\n5) According to you, who should ideally apply for this job?\n\nIf you have an interest in Data Science and want to work on real-life problems involving data science in the credit card industry then this is one of the best places to work. Work that you do here would actually add value to the company. The work here is more on the implementation and analytical side so folks who are really interested in the implementation of ML algorithms should definitely go for it.\n\n6) Any specific advice you want to give to the junta sitting for internships this year?\n\nMy advice to my juniors would be to decide the roles that they prepare for according to their interests. Instead of following the rat race develop your skill set in the particular field you actually like and want to work on. Don\u2019t just get into coding if you don\u2019t actually like coding. Explore various fields and decide according.\n\nAnother piece of advice I want to give is to remain positive and confident throughout the process. It is a cruel process, a bit dependent of luck and a lot of other factors that you cannot control. But always remember CDC internship is just a way for you to get an internship. It is certainly not the end of the world. There are ample opportunities out there. If you are not getting an internship through CDC then you shouldn\u2019t feel disheartened. Keep working hard and expanding your skill set. Keep looking out for off-campus internships and competitions.\n\nLastly, I would reiterate that you should decide whether you \u201cwant to get an intern\u201d or you \u201cwant to get an intern in a field that you are interested in\u201d. Depending on what is your answer prepare accordingly. If you want to prepare for more than one profile then prioritize accordingly and manage time effectively. Also, be confident during the interviews, and if you don\u2019t know the answer to any question just politely say that you don\u2019t know instead of meandering here and there and wasting time. Be honest in the interview and don\u2019t mention something in your CV that you haven\u2019t actually done.\n\n7) What are some of the major points you think would be valid to mention in your CV while targeting this profile? (any specific suggestions you would like to make?)\n\nWhen preparing for interviews in Data Analytics, do include one or two projects in this domain. In interviews for Data profiles, your CV plays quite an important role. Having projects in ML or DL would surely be a plus point on your CV and you would be able to drive your interview around the projects you have done. Also when mentioning an intern or a self project in your CV, the impact created (if any) and the improvement from a previous approach(if any) should be written."

        "content": "FORESIGHT(2023): Summer Internship at Glean| Aryan Singh|\n\n--\n\nListen\n\nBrief Introduction\n\nAs a final year dual degree student from the department of Computer Science and Engineering, IIT KGP, I have always been passionate about software development and problem-solving. Therefore, I was thrilled to learn about the SWE intern role at Glean, a growing company that offers many new challenges in the field of software development. In this blog, I will share my experience of getting selected for the SWE intern role at Glean and provide some tips for aspiring students who are looking for internships in this field.\n\nHow did I get into Glean? What was the selection procedure?\n\nI got an internship at Glean through an on-campus drive. They were one of the Day-1 companies, and the selection process involved a CV shortlisting followed by two technical interview rounds. The interviews mainly focused on testing my problem-solving skills and involved questions about data structures and algorithms.\n\nHow did I prepare for the interviews?\n\nTo prepare for the interviews, I focused on improving my problem-solving skills by practicing on Interview Bit and LeetCode. However, I was not aware of the interview pattern for the SWE intern role at Glean, so I started watching mock interviews of Google, Meta, and other companies to learn how to structure my answers and handle follow-up questions.\n\nWhat difficulties did I face while preparing, and how did I overcome them?\n\nOne of the difficulties I faced while preparing for this profile was the lack of knowledge about the interview pattern. However, by watching mock interviews, I was able to overcome this problem and gain a better understanding of what to expect in the interviews.\n\nWho should ideally apply for this job?\n\nIn my opinion, students who are passionate about solving real-world problems through software development and have strong problem-solving skills would be ideal candidates for the SWE intern role at Glean. As a growing company that has built its first iteration of the product, Glean offers many new challenges, such as scalability, efficiency, and harnessing large language models (LLMs) to solve enterprise-level problems. Therefore, individuals who enjoy solving complex problems and want to gain experience in a fast-paced startup environment would be an ideal fit for this role.\n\nAny specific advice you want to give to the junta sitting for internships this year?\n\nIf you are starting from scratch, I would strongly recommend mastering the Standard Template Library (STL), watching videos, and practicing on Interview Bit and LeetCode. I would suggest avoiding contests for now and focusing on solving more questions on these websites. Once you have attained adequate knowledge, you will be in a good position for interviews. In the meantime, you should also brush up on your Object-Oriented Programming (OOPs), Operating Systems (OS), and Networks courses.\n\nWhat are some of the major points you think would be valid to mention in your CV while targeting this profile?\n\nWhile targeting the SWE intern profile at Glean, it is better to have a good full-stack project in your CV as it allows interviewers to ask many theoretical questions. For example, they can ask about the ACID properties of databases, the four pillars of OOPs, or why you used Flask instead of Django or MySQL instead of MongoDB. It is advisable to give sufficient time and importance to the projects that you mention on your CV. Therefore, I would suggest highlighting any relevant projects or experiences you have had in the software development domain and clearly mentioning the technologies and tools you have used. Additionally, it would be beneficial to mention any relevant coursework or certifications you have completed in the field of computer science.\n\nIn conclusion, I would like to wish all aspiring students the best of luck in their pursuit of internships and careers in the field of software development. I would like to thank my parents, God, and the Career Development Cell (CDC) for the internship that I got."

        "content": "FORESIGHT(2023): Summer Internship at Cisco | Dhruv Rathi|\n\n--\n\nListen\n\n1) Brief Introduction\n\nI am Dhruv Rathi, a 3rd-year undergraduate student from the Department of Electronics and Electrical Communication Engineering at IIT Kharagpur. I am from Durgapur, West Bengal. I was the Tech Head at the Student Welfare Group and General Secretary Technology of LLR Hall for the academic session 2022\u201323. I have an interest in problem-solving and development. I am currently doing my summer internship at Cisco Systems in the software developer profile.\n\n2) How did you get into Cisco? What was the selection procedure?\n\nThe selection process for Cisco Systems consisted of one online test and 3 rounds of interviews.\n\nThe online test consisted of 2 sections:\n\ni) DSA questions\n\nii) MCQs related to computer science fundamentals, which included OOPS, OS, and computer networks mainly.\n\nI was able to solve the DSA questions but found the MCQ part a bit difficult as I had not prepared for OS and computer networks at that time. Still, I was shortlisted for the interviews.\n\nOne night before the interviews, I searched for what type of questions Cisco asks in their interviews and found that they do focus on computer networks and OS. As I did not have much time, I went through some GFG blogs on TCP/IP and OSI models.\n\nThe interviews were scheduled through Cisco Webex.\n\nThe first interview was a technical one, and it lasted for around 45 minutes. In this interview I was asked some questions related to pointers in C. Then I was also asked one DSA question. The interviewer was very inclined to ask questions about OS and computer networks. So in cases like this, if you have not prepared the topic thoroughly, you should try to dodge the question by saying it was not in your coursework and try to direct the interview to the topics that you have prepared well. I did the same, but in this case, the interviewer was very strong-willed to know whatever I knew about CN. So, I told him whatever I could recollect from the blogs I read.\n\nThe 2nd round of interviews was technical + situation-based or managerial questions. This was also around 30 minutes.\n\nThere was a question in this interview where I was asked, \u201cIf there is a program for an elevator, then what are the test cases we should give to check the program, and what can be the edge cases?\u201d\n\nI was also asked questions related to the projects and internships on my CV.\n\nThe last interview was an HR round, which lasted for 7 minutes.\n\nIt started with my introduction, in which I also briefly included my internships and projects.\n\nThen I was asked questions about what Cisco does and why I wanted to join it. In questions like this, you should try to impress the interviewer by saying how the company impacts the world.\n\nAfter that, he asked about my location preferences, and the interview concluded.\n\n3) How to prepare for them?\n\nFor the online test rounds:\n\nPrepare DSA thoroughly (this is common for all software companies). I would also like to add that give as many coding competitions as possible. This would help you solve the questions fast in the coding rounds of companies.\n\nAlong with that, prepare topics like OOPS, as it is also asked in the coding tests of some companies. Specifically for Cisco, you can try to cover computer networks also through blogs of GFG and interviewbit.\n\nFor the technical interviews, you can practice saying your logic along with coding the problem. Some companies have their coding platforms where they will tell you to code and then check for test cases. For others, they can tell you to code on google docs or paper (in the case of offline interviews). One can practice for these with their friends. Also, try to give some mock interviews before the CDC interviews start.\n\nOne piece of advice from my side is that for whichever company you are shortlisted for interviews, search the net to see what questions or topics the company focuses on in interviews and prepare accordingly.\n\nFor HR rounds:\n\nThere are some fixed sets of questions that are asked by HR, and you should have an answer prepared for them beforehand. Many times, at the end of the interview, the interviewer might ask if you have any questions for him/her. So I would suggest preparing some questions for them as well. You can find the answers to these things online.\n\n4) What difficulties did you face while preparing for this Company/Profile? How did you overcome this problem?\n\nAs I mentioned earlier, I had not prepared the OS and computer networks, so that was a disadvantage for me. The thing I liked about Cisco Systems was that they took all three rounds of interviews for everyone who was shortlisted and then selected on the basis of the aggregate of the three rounds. As my 2nd and 3rd rounds went well, I was finally selected.\n\nIn CDC, it is very important that no matter how good/bad your previous interview went, it should not reflect on the next interview. On some days, you can have multiple interviews with different companies, and this becomes very important during that time. It can happen that you felt the interview went very well, but you are still not selected. So, you should be mentally prepared for situations like this. In situations like this, it will be good to talk with your seniors, as they must have gone through similar situations and can help you with your problems.\n\n5) According to you, who should ideally apply for this job?\n\nAnyone who is aiming for the software profile should apply to Cisco Systems.\n\n6) Any specific advice you want to give to the junta sitting for internships this year?\n\nIt is important that you focus on one profile and prepare for it thoroughly. There will be many distractions in your peer group, but you should be clear on what you should be doing.\n\nYou should never hesitate to talk to or take advice from any senior, but again, remember that even if you take advice from many people, the final decision on what should be done is yours. So prepare smartly, and in the end, everything will be sorted!\n\n7) What are some of the major points you think would be valid to mention in your CV while targeting this profile? (any specific suggestions you would like to make?)\n\nFor software roles, the most important part of the CV is the projects and internship section. So expect to get questions related to your projects. Prepare them properly, and you should be able to defend whatever you write in your CV."

I\u2019ll be interning at AlphaGrep Securities in the summer of 2023 as a Software Developer.\n\n2) How did you get into AlphaGrep? What was the selection procedure?\n\nThe role was open only for circuital departments like CS, MA, EC, EE, and IM. The selection procedure consists of an intense coding round followed by an interview or a series of interviews.\n\nThe coding round had 5 CP questions to be solved in 90 mins. They were from a varying range of difficulties. The first question was a typical linked list query. The second was an interactive problem based on finding a sink in the graph. Third was a medium ad-hoc question using priority queues and binary search operations like lower and upper bound. The fourth was based on bitmasking. Finally, the fifth one was on level order search in a binary tree.\n\nThe interview was a bit tough, with questions based on DSA and some concepts from C++, like virtual functions, dynamic polymorphism, and shared pointers. It is also recommended that you should know some basics of system design and memory management.\n\n3) How to prepare for them?\n\nMost of your preparation time will be involved around Data Structures and Algorithms. Apart from this, it would be best to know C++ OOPS concepts. AlphaGrep tests your C++ knowledge for the Software Development Role, as most work involves C++.\n\nThey also sometimes test your systems knowledge with questions from Operating Systems and Computer Networks. Therefore, it would be handy if you had some knowledge of them.\n\nKeep your CG as high as possible. As far as I can remember AlphaGrep doesn\u2019t specify any CG cutoff, but they shortlisted only those students with a CG \u2265 9.30.\n\n4) What difficulties did you face while preparing for this Company/Profile? How did you overcome this problem\n\nI was having a lot of problems initially with CP and DSA. I always struggled to solve medium-hard problems on coding platforms like Codeforces. My consistency and persistence in doing the DSA problems was the key to overcoming this, eventually leading to better results.\n\n5) According to you, who should ideally apply for this job?\n\nThe job is most suited for any individual who-\n\nHaving some suitable coursework, research projects, or open-source activities, ideally in C++, is a plus point.\n\n6) Any specific advice you want to give to the junta sitting for internships this year?\n\nIf you are preparing for SDE roles, try keeping DSA and CP skills as high as possible. Maintain your CG and accept to face rejection. Sometimes you may have performed well in a company interview but weren\u2019t selected, but on the other hand, you get selected for a company in which you had very little chance. Try to do as much as you can. Sometimes you won\u2019t get what you expected, but be consistent and keep confidence in yourself.\n\n7) What are some of the major points you think would be valid to mention in your CV while targeting this profile? (any specific suggestions you would like to make?)\n\nDay 1 companies like AlphaGrep and many other HFTs mostly overlook your CV. The only thing they are looking for in your CV is your Department and CG. It\u2019s highly preferred that you are from a circuital department with a CG > 9. Apart from this, these companies only need good programming and mathematical ability."

I am a third year undergraduate from the mechanical engineering department. As for my involvements on campus, I was the CDC Departmental Representative of the Mechanical Engineering department as well as a part of AGV and Encore.\n\n2) How did you get into ITC? What was the selection procedure?\n\n3) How to prepare for them?\n\nThe Google form basically collects your academic track record in addition to your motivation to join the company. I suggest writing concise and crisp answers, strongly highlighting why you want to work for ITC and how you shall be able to contribute to the same. It may come as a bummer to some but SGPA is also taken into account in addition to CGPA. Consistency is rewarded. The GD is there to test your communication skills as well as your ability to translate problems into smaller, more digestible bits. Linear thinking and simple case solving can be practiced to ensure a solid performance in the GD. The topics mentioned on your CV, especially from your core department, have to be prepared thoroughly as they might be asked in the interview. Ensure that you are thorough with at least 3 topics from your depth curriculum. The HR round is fairly straightforward and tests your quick thinking and reasoning ability. I was presented with the task of employing what I have done in my previous internship at IISc in a real life scenario in the final interview.\n\n4) What difficulties did you face while preparing for this Company/Profile? How did you overcome this problem\n\nAccording to me the most unpredictable part of the whole process is the first shortlist, that is after the Google Form. There is no specific criteria on which you are judged, so you can not necessarily predict if you\u2019ll be shortlisted or not. Having a decent CGPA helps a ton but giving solid answers for your motivation to work at the company will also be a major role. Ensure that you take advice from your mentors/ seniors.\n\n5) According to you, who should ideally apply for this job?\n\nITC offers interns the ability to work on large, real life problems which can offer an extremely enriching experience with a steep learning curve. It truly is an experience and I would suggest everyone who has the will to make a difference to consider applying to the job. The projects you get are based on your strengths and points highlighted in your interview/CV.\n\n6) Any specific advice you want to give to the junta sitting for internships this year.\n\nI would suggest having at least one project in core/field you want to work in. It greatly helps in driving the interview as well as ensures that the interviewer does not deviate too much and ask questions which are either too difficult or irrelevant. It also helps in covering up gaps in your preparation of core topics. In addition to this being confident, having a positive outlook as well as a no-nonsense approach to answers will get you a long way. All the very best, internships are just a very small step in the long journey that awaits you all. Don\u2019t fret, you got this.\n\n7) What are some of the major points you think would be valid to mention in your CV while targeting this profile?(any specific suggestions you would like to make?)\n\nAs I mentioned before, have some projects and prepare them thoroughly. Think of real life applications of the same so that you can tie that in during the interview. Mention academic courses very carefully as you can be grilled on the same.

        "content": "FORESIGHT(2023): Summer Internship at LEK | Ram Sundaram |\n\n--\n\n1\n\nListen\n\n1) Brief Introduction\n\nAhh, the familiar \u201cIntro De\u201d.\n\nI\u2019ll try to write this as frankly as possible and in the same spirit of honesty; I\u2019ll also disclose that I\u2019m also writing this in quite a hurry, aiming to finish this within the duration of a 2-hour flight, so please excuse me for grammar issues and anything else nonsensical.\n\nI\u2019m also unsure if I\u2019m allowed to swear in SWG articles, so I\u2019ll be creative here and there. Additionally, I will assume that the reader is familiar with the basic CDC profiles and their general requirements. If not, here they are:\n\nI\u2019ll start off, then, with the cookie-cutter KGP intro.\n\nMy name is Ram Sundaram. I\u2019m a 3rd year (as of the time of writing this) undergraduate student of the Department of Biotechnology enrolled in its BTech course. I am a boarder of Vidyasagar Hall of Residence. I am from Bangalore, Karnataka.\n\nWith that done, some other stuff about me are that I\u2019m currently the Head Finance at Business Club. I\u2019m interested in a bunch of stuff like data analytics, finance, economics, and machine learning, but I haven\u2019t really delved super deep into anything. I do quite like my core as well, but yeah, I ain\u2019t pursuing that shoot because opportunities are severely limited, and a Master\u2019s Degree is a minimum requirement, if not a PhD. I\u2019m a lazy human being, so that\u2019s not for me, for now, at least. I also did quite a bit of CP during my CDC prep and was actually focused on obtaining an analytics/SDE role, but as things would have it, I wouldn\u2019t end up with any of the Day 1 Tech shortlists I wanted (probably due to a combination of my highly non-circuital department and my own underperformance in tests) and ended up in the most non-CP role possible with LEK Consulting, which I am nonetheless extremely grateful for.\n\n2) How did you get into LEK? What was the selection procedure?\n\nHow did I get into LEK? Well, to be honest, I\u2019m still searching for the answer myself right now. I\u2019m still a bit gob smacked as to how it all happened. However, I\u2019ll do my best to summarize it here.\n\nSo, it all started off with my CV. Unbeknownst to me, I had a strong \u201cConsulting CV\u201d and ended up with two out of three big consulting shortlists. I\u2019ll elucidate the CV requirements in a later section.\n\nI then got a call from a PlaceComm around a week before Day 1 informing me of the same. Usually, companies release shortlists a day or two before Day 1, but consulting companies like to be extremely early and take their pick of the best. In fact, they actually fight amongst each other in quite a comical fashion to get the first pick, with BCG and Bain having quite the dramatic selections last year, fighting over individual candidates. If anything, LEK lost out in this battle last year. BCG and Bain were able to select their desired candidates almost a week before Day 1, while LEK was left holding the bag and had to wait until Day 1. This year, I fully expect LEK not to fall into this trap again and select their guys and gals well beforehand.\n\nShortly after the shortlist call, I got an email from the LEK HR representatives themselves assigning me a \u201cbuddy\u201d. All consulting companies use this buddy system. They assign you a buddy who\u2019s a full-time junior employee (usually fresh out of college themselves). You can talk to your buddy, ask them any questions you have, and do case prep with them. Maintain a good rapport with your buddy, and they may put in a strong word for you with their management (who finally decide whether to select you or not). However, interactions with your buddy generally are very chill and relaxed. You don\u2019t have to worry here. Your buddy is just here to help. My buddy was extremely helpful, did 2 or 3 cases with me over the phone, and helped me with all my questions about the interview procedure.\n\nSo, after this, we\u2019re supposed to have \u201cbuddy rounds\u201d, where we have a supposedly non-evaluative session with some of the more senior employees. Even though they say non-evaluative, believe me, these are very evaluative. They\u2019re effectively the actual interviews themselves. Now, for me, there was some colossal duck-up, and LEK actually completely forgot about my existence during these Day 0 rounds (Day 0 is any interview procedure before Day 1) So, I wasn\u2019t informed about these buddy rounds. So, I actually had a sped-up version of these buddy rounds on Day 1 itself. However, I\u2019ve heard from my fellow interns at LEK and went through a similar experience with my Bain shortlist as well (they ultimately rejected me), so I can still tell you what happens here.\n\nNow, you usually have 2\u20133 interview rounds. The first one is with a manager; if you make it to the second, it\u2019s with a partner at the firm. You can\u2019t get in without the partner approving you. Think of him/her as the final boss. The interviews themselves could involve anything. They usually have cases or guesstimates (I will explain these below), but it could even be an ordinary discussion regarding the most random shoot. Personally, here\u2019s how my interview rounds went:\n\nFor me, this entire interview process happened on Day 1, but usually, they conduct these a week before and informally extend offers by then. Then they make you sit for an interview on Day 1 as a technicality because they aren\u2019t supposed to give out offers beforehand. This is so they can nab the good candidates earlier and prevent them from sitting for any other company interviews.\n\nIn general, the above-listed buddy round and interview process is a shared interview procedure among all consulting firms.\n\n3) How to prepare for them?\n\nNow, the first and, honestly, the most crucial step is making a brilliant CV to even get that shortlist. Consulting shortlists are purely CV-based with no department biases (CG does matter, though, unfortunately). I\u2019ll talk about the actual things that make an excellent consulting CV in a later section, but one thing I\u2019ll emphasize here is that you need to put effort into getting that CV perfect, even if it means spending hours on end fixing minute formatting details on ERP\u2019s god-awful CV platform. Imagine being stuck in never-ending traffic on your way to the mall while your movie started 10 minutes ago in the theatre. That\u2019s how frustrating it feels to make CVs on ERP.\n\nNow, onto post-shortlist preparation. Before that, let me just quickly explain what cases and guesstimates are. These are the most popular types of questions in consulting interviews. Guesstimates make you answer a strange question like \u201cHow many cigarettes are sold in a day in India?\u201d and you have to walk the interviewer through your solution, segmenting things and coming up with a final answer. So, for example, in the above question, you could divide it into segments of the population that smoke, like college students, working professionals, etc. and break it down further to give a final number.\n\nCases are similar but are meant to emulate real-life consulting scenarios. Obviously, solving a real case takes months while you have a 20-minute interview, so they\u2019re far simpler. There are different types of cases that you\u2019ll learn about as you go through the prep materials, but they usually involve a vague question like \u201cAn electronics company has been facing losses recently. Figure out how to fix it.\u201d You\u2019ll then be expected to ask questions to the interviewer to find out more details about the company and drill down to the exact nature of the problem.\n\nAgain, if cases seem complicated, believe me, they are not, and you\u2019ll understand quickly after looking at a few samples in the resources I\u2019ll provide.\n\nAnyhow, back to the shoot you were here for. While it\u2019s advisable to learn the basics and understand how cases work beforehand, please do not spend a significant amount of time of your CDC prep on cases in the hope of a consult shortlist. Consult shortlists are few and far between and extremely variable. If you are even slightly inclined to any other role that could use some prep, I\u2019d advise you to focus on that until you get a consult shortlist. Once you get the shortlist, however, it\u2019s time to shift gears and chug cases!\n\nI\u2019ll first elucidate on the general strategy for preparing for consulting and then talk about my own personal preparation and the resources I used.\n\nI\u2019d divide consult prep into two broad steps:\n\nHonestly, with enough dedication, case prep can be completed in a week or two. Hence, I advise only starting after a shortlist and doing something like CP or anything else in the meantime. Do Step 1 beforehand if you\u2019re serious about consulting, but generally, wait until the shortlist to chug cases in Step 2.\n\nAlright, on to actual concrete things you can start right now and resources you can look at. While there are many routes for prepping, here\u2019s what I did:\n\n4) What are some of the major points you think would be valid to mention in your CV while targeting this profile?(any specific suggestions you would like to make?)\n\nAlright, now for the most critical part of this blog, in my opinion. Your CV is everything for consulting. You\u2019re in if you have the right CV. So, as I mentioned earlier, if you\u2019re serious about this, put a lot of effort into making an undeniably brilliant CV. Now, in general, consulting companies look for a sort of all-round CV that needs a \u201cspike\u201d in every section. Also, there\u2019s absolutely no department bias here; all are treated as equals. So, without any further ado, let\u2019s look at the various CV sections and the possible \u201cspikes\u201d:\n\nTo summarise, try to have an all-round CV with spikes in different sections that make you stand out from the crowd. Also, spend a lot of time perfecting your CV to avoid correctable grammar and formatting errors.\n\n5) What difficulties did you face while preparing for this Company/Profile? How did you overcome this problem?\n\nThe main problem I faced specifically with case prep was the frustration of being unable to solve cases. Initially, as with any new task, you will struggle, but seeing friends who had started prep earlier being able to solve cases quickly kinda sucked. It\u2019s especially hard when you know your future hangs in the balance and depends on your ability to solve cases. In the end, I just put my head down, tried to solve as many as I could and eventually got the hang of it.\n\nApart from this, there was the standard CDC mental trauma. CDC is a ducked-up time for one\u2019s mind, in my experience. You go to dark places, and all you really have to hang onto are your friends who are going through the same thing. But they\u2019re all you need anyways.\n\n6) According to you, who should ideally apply for this job?\n\nIn my opinion, unless you really detest consulting and don\u2019t want to \u201crisk\u201d getting offered an esteemed consulting job, apply. There\u2019s no harm in applying; if you get shortlisted, fantastic!\n\n7) Any specific advice you want to give to the junta sitting for internships this year?\n\nI think I\u2019ll use this medium to address two of the main talking points of CDC.\n\nFirst and foremost, as I mentioned earlier, your mind goes to dark places during this time. In KGP especially, there\u2019s this extreme pressure to get your summer sorted, and that has messed-up ramifications. I recall stressing out over not getting shortlists and just launching into obscenity-filled tirades against certain companies (some still reserve a special place of abhorrence in my heart). I remember being the most nervous I was before my first interview with Bain and even ended up vomiting just a few minutes before the interview out of stress. I also screwed up the interview, so that just piled on the pressure. But at the end of the day, I had my closest friends going through the same thing as me, and the beautiful 5-year people were always there to help out, forcing me to consume some form of nutrition on Day 1 when I had no energy remaining to give another interview. The RR sessions helped a lot too, especially once we were back on campus (Day 0 interviews were online). To summarise, everyone goes through shoot during CDC; it\u2019s perfectly normal. But, go through it together, please. Don\u2019t keep it to yourself. Get together and launch into tirades about annoying companies, have RR sessions about PlaceComms and the process itself, and scream away your woes; it all helps. The important thing is reaching out. On that note, if anyone has reached this far into the article and is going through something and wants to reach out to me for any questions or anything in general, feel free to mail me at rams.dude@gmail.com (don\u2019t ask for the backstory of the mail ID, please). I\u2019ll get in touch asap and try to help as much as I can.\n\nThe last thing I wanted to address is the \u201cTo CP or Not To CP\u201d question that crops up in everyone\u2019s mind. I\u2019ll try to keep my answer brief and lay down some facts beforehand. Generally, only a few Investment Bank roles (a lot like Goldman Sachs and JPMC still require a bit of CP in their tests), consulting roles, and the rare product roles don\u2019t require some form of programming knowledge or CP. And this year, the scenario with hiring in a lot of IBs is still up in the air. So, not doing CP is a risk. However, if you absolutely detest technical roles and do not see yourself in any sort of SDE or Analytics role, then I\u2019d say your time is best utilised elsewhere. However, if even a slight part of you doesn\u2019t mind this kind of a role, CP is a vast safety net if the other options don\u2019t work out. Also, always keep in mind that there\u2019s a substantial off-campus world out there, too, even larger than the on-campus world, to be honest. It just needs a little searching (both LinkedIn and soul searching).\n\nAll the best, guys!"

        "content": "FORESIGHT(2023): Summer Internship at Sprinklr | Gaurav Malakar |\n\n--\n\n2\n\nListen\n\n1) Brief Introduction\n\nHello everyone! My name is Gaurav Malakar, and I am currently a 3rd-year undergraduate student pursuing a BTech course in Computer Science and Engineering. I am excited to share that I recently secured an internship opportunity as a Product Engineering Intern at Sprinklr, a well-known IT company. In this blog, I will walk you through my journey and provide valuable insights into the steps I took to land this internship role.\n\n2) How did you get into Sprinklr? What was the selection procedure?\n\nCV Submission: To apply for the position, I had to submit my CV through the ERP system. Fortunately, Sprinklr did not have an explicit CGPA cutoff, allowing a wide range of students to apply and be selected for the coding round.\n\nCoding Test: The coding test at Sprinklr was relatively straightforward compared to other Day-1 companies. It consisted of three questions focused on Data Structures and Algorithms. Although I don\u2019t recall the exact questions, one of them was a simple array problem, while the other two were graph-based problems. Candidates who were able to solve at least two questions successfully moved on to the next round of selection.\n\nInterview Round-1: During this interview round, I had a pleasant experience with a friendly interviewer. After introducing myself, we moved on to the technical questions. The first question was challenging dynamic programming (DP) problem, which I tackled successfully due to my familiarity with such problems. Next, I was presented with a recursion-based question that involved implementing a JSON-like class in C++. The interviewer provided specific requirements and functions, and I was able to code them accordingly. Additionally, I faced an object-oriented programming (OOP) question where I had to design a company hierarchy using classes. The interviewer gave detailed requirements for the system and posed various questions while I worked on the solution. Throughout the interview, I maintained a continuous interaction with the interviewer and incorporated feedback into my code. All the coding in this round was done on google docs.\n\nInterview Round-2: This round was purely based on CP. I was asked 2 questions, both of which were moderately hard. The first question was based on multisource BFS, and the second question was based on the Level Order Traversal of the Binary tree but can be optimized for special cases. In this round, the interviewer allowed me to use any IDE of my choice. The round Lasted for 45 minutes.\n\nHR Round: The HR round was a real head-scratcher for me. The HR representative fired away with a series of questions that left me feeling like I was in the middle of a comedy skit. Here\u2019s a breakdown of the memorable moments:\n\n\u201cTell me about a hard situation in your life that you overcame.\u201d It felt like I was in a movie, searching for that one challenging moment that tested my resilience and determination.\n\n\u201cTell me what Sprinklr does.\u201d Oh, the infamous \u201cexplain the company\u201d question. Suddenly, my mind went blank, and I felt like I was trying to explain rocket science to a toddler. Somehow, I managed to fumble my way through it with a generous sprinkling of flattery for the tech team.\n\nAnd then came the dreaded question: \u201cWhich is your favorite company?\u201d I found myself in a tricky spot because I couldn\u2019t simply say \u201cSprinklr.\u201d This question seemed more daunting than all the complex DSA questions I faced earlier. It required me to tap into my inner politician and carefully navigate my way through the answer.\n\nDespite the twists and turns, I somehow managed to survive the HR round with a mix of creativity, quick thinking, and perhaps a touch of luck. Life has a way of throwing curveballs at us, but it\u2019s how we handle them that counts.\n\n3) How to prepare for them?\n\nThe things that you should prepare are DSA, Projects, and also OOP. Let\u2019s check out these topics in a little more detail:-\n\nDSA (Data Structures and Algorithms): This is the most important topic you need to prepare for. I was introduced to DSA during my Algorithms-1 course, and I also supplemented my learning with additional topics from YouTube. Many of my friends have taken the AlgoZenith course and found it very useful. However, if you already have prior knowledge of DSA, you can consider skipping AlgoZenith and learning from YouTube instead. During my preparation, I also solved problems from a website called InterviewBit, which I recommend starting around 1.5 months before coding rounds. Additionally, I regularly participated in coding contests on Codeforces.\n\nProjects: It is highly recommended to include at least one project on your CV. In my case, I included a term project and an assignment. If you are short on time, you can also include simpler projects. However, it is important to note that lying in the project description can be risky, as interviewers may ask questions about those topics. Luckily, I wasn\u2019t questioned about my project during my interview, but some of my friends faced extensive questioning regarding their projects. Therefore, it\u2019s crucial to choose your projects wisely.\n\nIf you have limited knowledge beyond C++, you can still work on simple projects using Python or JavaScript. These languages are beginner-friendly, and it\u2019s possible to complete a project in either of them within two weeks or less.\n\nOOP (Object-Oriented Programming): I was asked one question about OOP during my interview. To prepare for this topic, I studied articles from Geeks For Geeks (GFG) and watched YouTube videos. OOP is generally considered an easier topic, and it\u2019s common for Day-1 or Day-2 companies to ask questions about it.\n\nMiscellaneous: In addition to the aforementioned topics, I also dedicated some time to learning puzzles, although they didn\u2019t come in handy as much. However, some HFT (High-Frequency Trading) companies did ask puzzle questions in their interviews. To further prepare for interview rounds, I conducted mock interviews with my friends. We would select questions for each other and utilize Google Docs for coding.\n\n4) What difficulties did you face while preparing for this Company/Profile? How did you overcome this problem?\n\nI didn\u2019t focus my preparation on any specific company. The topics I learned were commonly asked in many companies. Throughout my preparation, I encountered some challenges, such as not having a clear direction and occasionally lacking motivation during the three-month period. Fortunately, people who choose AlgoZenith, probably won\u2019t face these issues. However, for others, I highly recommend creating a roadmap for each topic you plan to learn during your preparation. Having a roadmap was instrumental in overcoming the challenge of not having a clear path to follow.\n\n5) According to you, who should ideally apply for this job?\n\nAnyone with a passion for programming can apply for this opportunity. The company is experiencing rapid growth, making it an excellent starting point for individuals aspiring to pursue a career as a software developer.\n\n6) Any specific advice you want to give to the junta sitting for internships this year.\n\nA valuable piece of practical advice I would like to share is \u201cNever leave your fate in someone else\u2019s hands.\u201d If you believe that you can bag an internship solely through the help of a friend, remember that the chances of success are quite slim. Instead, invest your energy in thorough preparation. It\u2019s not necessary to work intensely for long hours. Instead, focus on maintaining consistency. Dedicate a moderate amount of time each day (around 5\u20138 hours) to studying rather than cramming for 12 hours on certain days.\n\n7) Kindly attach your resume. What are some of the major points you think would be valid to mention in your CV while targeting this profile?

I am a fourth year student of the department of Humanities and Social Sciences and a boarder of Patel Hall of Residence. In the past, I have worked at multiple organizations like Zomato, Invest India, Harvard Business School and now I am working as a Summer Associate at the Boston Consulting Group (BCG).\n\n2) How did you get into BCG? What was the selection procedure?Firstly, there are pre-placement talks, the shortlisting process started, which could depends on variety of factors such as CGPA, Position of Responsibilities, Past Experience, Extracurriculars and so on. After that, consulting firms generally have a buddy or case rounds. In my case, the first case round was taken by a Project Leader and the second by a Managing Director & Senior Partner at the firm. After multiple rounds, the candidates were selected on the basis of problem solving attitude, approach towards the case and communication and other skillset.\n\n3) How to prepare for them?You need to have a structured approach towards case preparation, alongside some good friends who can help you do extensive case practice.. Practice cases and guesstimates from books such as DayOne, Case Interviews Cracked and IIM-A Casebook. Those who prefer YouTube playlists can also refer to Victor Cheng\u2019s video lectures.\n\n4) What difficulties did you face while preparing for this Company/Profile? How did you overcome this problem?The timeline between the CV submission, shortlist release and buddy/caserounds is often varying and can be very short too. In order to ensure goodcase skills, I believe candidates should be farsighted and do the requiredpractice beforehand. In our case also, I had a few amazing friends who helped me prepare beforehand, to ensure peace of mind during the final weeks.\n\n5) According to you, who should ideally apply for this job?Consulting is a natural fit for people with structured thinking and attention to detail. It is also a great opportunity to get exposure on a diverse set ofindustries, projects and problem statements that can help an individual gain considerable experiences across domains. Those who love a fast-paced line with challenging problem statements, that can change the commercial or public sector as we know it, should put in a fight for consulting.\n\n6) Kindly attach your resume. What are some of the major points you think would be valid to mention in your CV while targeting this profile? (any specific suggestions you would like to make?)A good CGPA helps a lot in getting shortlists (Not just for consulting, but ingeneral for CDC). Good exposure in past internships with meaningful work, that might be from any domain, be it Strategy or Finance or Tech, wil surely help you shine out. Some entrepreneurial experience or acts of initiative might also help you boost your chances of getting shortlisted.\n\n7) Any specific advice you want to give to the junta sitting for internships this year?You\u2019ll hear a lot of competition, tips-tricks, rumors, toxicity and what not when it comes to preparation or shortlists or transparency of process. There might be a constant sense of insecurity about your preparation or what you deserve. But always remember: There is no right path to a particular role, for everyone has to pave their own journey. There will be a whole lot of random variables, but the right mindset will always take you places. Getting an internship is not the end of the world; being happy is."

        "content": "FORESIGHT(2023): Summer Internship at DE Shaw | Jothi Prakash |\n\n--\n\nListen\n\nIntroduction\n\nI am Jothi Prakash, pursuing my dual degree in Electronics and Electrical Communication Engineering with my specialization in Vision and Intelligent Systems.\n\nHow did you get into DE Shaw? What was the selection procedure?\n\nI got into DE Shaw through the CDC internship process that happens at the beginning of 4th year for dual and at the beginning of 3rd year for Btech students.\n\nDE Shaw consisted of 3 questions where each question was supposed to solved within the time limit provided and you could not carry forward the time from one question to the another. The questions were of moderate difficulty with the problems ranging between 1400 to 1700 rating on codeforces. The test included mostly adhoc, greedy and DP questions. People who solved all the 3 questions were only considered for the interviews.\n\nHow to prepare for them?\n\nPreparation for DE Shaw is similar to all the SDE companies that come on Day 1 / 2 on the campus. I mostly prepared using Codeforces and Codechef website, but I also recommend people to look at the CSES problem set as well as the Atcoder educational DP contest. Giving regular contests and up solving them after the contest does most of the preparation for the coding tests. Coming to proficiency in CP, I would say you should be someone who is able to solve ~1800 rated problems on Codeforces with minor help if you are targeting Day 1 companies.\n\nApart from CP you also need to have a good command over OOPS concepts as they are frequently asked during the interviews of companies. I mostly prepared for OOPs by reading blogs on GFG and also reading interview experience articles on GFG. Sometimes companies also tend to ask questions from OS, and therefore, I had prepared for OS as well, and it came in handy at DE Shaw as they asked a lot of OS in my interviews. But I would say if you are short on time you can skip the OS bit as it is not that important.\n\nWhat difficulties did you face while preparing for this Profile? How did you overcome this problem\n\nThe biggest problem that I, along with probably everyone that did CP faced was rating stagnation, where you continuously give contests and practice problems, but your rating does not improve or even worse, sometimes degrades. It is a very disheartening situation to be in, but you must realize that results and efforts don\u2019t follow a linear curve. In the beginning, you might not see any results, but all of a sudden, you might see all the results, and this is something you must believe in.\n\nYou must constantly back yourself up and keep your morale high, as in the end not giving up will make all the difference. I know it\u2019s easier said than done, but I guess that\u2019s the challenge.\n\nAccording to you, who should ideally apply for this job?\n\nAnyone who is interested in the field of software engineering, machine learning, or quant can apply for this job as there are profiles in DE Shaw that cater to these skill sets.\n\nAny specific advice you want to give to the junta sitting for internships this year?\n\nThe entire CDC internship process is a stressful time and many times you will feel like you have done nothing compared to others, but just have faith in your preparation. Remember that it is just a 2 months internship in your probably 25+ years of career ahead so it\u2019s not the end of the world if you don\u2019t get it. Also, make sure to have a good friend circle to practice together and conduct mock interviews with each other.\n\nRemember that luck is an important factor and sometimes you just can\u2019t help it, so don\u2019t necessarily think that not getting a Day 1 or Day 2 captures your capability. There are plenty of opportunities outside and believe in yourself and your abilities\n\nWhat are some of the major points you think would be valid to mention in your CV while targeting this profile?(any specific suggestions you would like to make?)\n\nYou can mention some software / ML related projects that you have completed, this becomes even more important in certain companies that purely do CV shortlisting for the interviews. The use of proper formatting and grammatical statements such as action words, etc. in a CV is very important. I would ask you to go through some reference CVs of seniors or on the Internet to get an idea of what needs to be done.\n\nParticularly for SDE companies, PORs don\u2019t matter so if you are targeting these roles I would say focusing your time on off-campus internships or projects is the way to go.\n\nLast but not least CGPA matters and so don\u2019t screw it up in any case, try to keep it as high as possible."

My professional interests lie in Data Science and Analytics including the development part and I often indulge in various extracurricular activities in my leisure time.\n\nHow did you get into Honeywell? What was the selection procedure?\n\nThere are three rounds of the selection process for Honeywell. The first round is a coding test that consists of 3 questions of medium difficulty level that could be easily solved if you have been practicing DSA for a decent time (here I mean at least 2 months of consistency).\n\nThe second round is the technical interview where they test your technical knowledge mainly using interview topics like oops, pseudo-code of basic CP questions, probability and statistics, and puzzles. You can also expect CV grilling in this round as in my case I was asked only on my CV [Past projects and experiences].\n\nThe third and final round is the cultural interview which is mostly just a formality and is taken by the HR of the company. It's just to check whether you are a good fit for the company\u2019s work environment. Before going to this round, it's better to prepare about the company a little bit [its recent projects, main domain of work, and latest company leaders and news.]\n\nHow to prepare for them?\n\nTo prepare for the coding test, you need to practice Data Structures and Algorithms thoroughly to cover all topics at a medium difficulty level at least. I prepared for it from Algozenith and then practiced questions on platforms like Interview Bit and Leetcode. This would give you a good grasp of mostly all types of questions asked in these kinds of coding tests.\n\nThere are some specific topics that you need to cater to for the technical interview part. Topics like OOPS, Time Complexities, Pseudo code of basic algorithms and problems. Apart from it, you should be very thorough with your CV as there are very high chances of the interviewer starting with your past projects and if you have a good grasp on them then there you go!\n\nYou could drive the interview towards your side as happened in my case. There is no such preparation required for the last or the cultural round which is taken by the HR of the company. For that you should be familiar with the domains the company works in, its recent projects, and the latest company news.\n\nWhat difficulties did you face while preparing for this Company/Profile? How did you overcome this problem?\n\nThe major problem I faced was getting acquainted with and maintaining consistency in competitive programming. I started it (sincerely) in the month of May and I had just the next 3 months to make it to a mark.\n\nThe only way I found to overcome this is to think of every question you do as a milestone and feel a sense of achievement after solving it. This way you will realize your progress day by day.\n\nTip: Cover theory in as less time as possible and try to practice as many questions as possible (majorly from Interview Bit)\n\nThe other problem could be seeing your friends preparing and learning at a very fast rate. Try to avoid such discussions and just focus on your preparation, and your pace of learning.\n\nAccording to you, who should ideally apply for this job?\n\nThis is a Software Development Engineer role, therefore the people who have a high inclination towards development as well as coding should prefer this role. Also, the people who are interested in AI/ML can also go for it as there is a good chance that your project is based on these domains as well.\n\nAny specific advice you want to give to the junta sitting for internships this year?\n\nOne specific piece of advice I would like to give is that don\u2019t be very specific with any company or role because there are not many companies for each and every role during CDC internships, hence in order to increase your chances to bag an internship through CDC, try to broaden your spectrum as much as possible.\n\nWhat are some of the major points you think would be valid to mention in your CV while targeting this profile?\n\nFor a software profile, there are as such no specific points to keep in mind but as a general opinion, try to have spikes in your CV by which I mean include projects, internships (if any), achievements, positions of responsibility (not of much importance in software profile) as well as extracurriculars. Prepare your CV thoroughly before going to an interview."

I am currently working at Trexquant as a Quantitative Research Intern.\n\n2) How did you get into Trexquant? What was the selection procedure?\n\nI got into Trexquant through the CDC Internship Program. Trexquant usually recruits interns only through their GAR program, but they visited our campus this time.\n\nThere were two rounds of selection after a usual CV shortlist. The first round was a short subjective test, followed by a personal interview ( two for some candidates).\n\nThe test was very unorthodox for two reasons - one, it was purely subjective and two, we were encouraged to use the internet during the test. It was designed to test two things: your understanding of financial markets and your approach to modelling a problem using Machine Learning.\n\nThe interview was purely technical. They grilled me on my CV, and then I was asked to code a simple CP problem live (Python was preferred).\n\n3) How to prepare for them?\n\nSince quant is essentially a combination of data and finance, you would be required to do both.\n\nFinance: Zerodha Varsity and Bloomberg Market Concepts are great resources. Open a Zerodha account and just play around with some money\n\nDSA: GeeksForGeeks or any random Youtube video for arrays, sorting and searching\n\nML: Andrew NG\u2019s is the go-to course. Do at least one project from scratch to be comfortable with implementation.\n\n4) What difficulties did you face while preparing for this Company/Profile? How did you overcome this problem\u00a0?\n\nI hadn\u2019t done any kind of CP before CDC. But most of the companies I applied for asked CP questions in some part of the selection process. Thanks to my friends, I made up for the lack of preparation by discussing problems with them over the last few days. Since I wasn\u2019t very comfortable in C++, I coded in Python during tests (which helped during my interview).\n\n5) According to you, who should ideally apply for this job?\n\nAnyone who, has an understanding of, or willing to learn the working of the global macroeconomy and markets enjoys playing with data\n\ncan work independently in an environment which is highly competitive as well as rewarding\n\nis a rapid learner, creative and comfortable with taking risks\n\n6) Any specific advice you want to give to the junta sitting for internships this year.\n\nAlthough CDC internships are a one-time chance, you should choose companies and roles wisely. Keep working on your interests and expand your skill set; you are bound to emerge victorious at the end!\n\nMake a group of friends targeting similar profiles and help out each other during the preparation. Always feel free to reach out to seniors or anyone else for queries.\n\nLastly, it is important not to succumb to peer pressure and other overwhelming stuff around. Remember that perseverance pays off, and remarkable opportunities await.\n\n7) What are some of the major points you think would be valid to mention in your CV while targeting this profile?(any specific suggestions you would like to make?)\n\nGenerally, it is quite hard to find a project or intern relevant to this field. So, it would be optimal to have a mix of points relating to finance and data in your CV. Additionally, try to explore different techniques like NLP in addition to traditional ML.\n\nI encourage students to intern somewhere (there are a ton of new quant-related startups) in the summer so that your CV stands out."

        "content": "FORESIGHT(2023): Summer Internship at JSW| Lalam Hari Prasad |\n\n--\n\nListen\n\nBrief Introduction:\n\nHello Everyone! I am Lalam Hari Prasad, a fourth-year undergraduate student in the Department of Metallurgical and Materials Engineering. I joined JSW as a Supply Chain & Logistics Intern (BPSL Plant Odisha) in the Summer of 2023 as part of their Summer Internship Program (SIP).\n\nHow did you get into JSW? What was the selection procedure?\n\nThere were three rounds in the selection procedure: an online assessment, a group discussion, and an interview.\n\na. Online Assessment: It consisted of two sections; one section primarily focuses on the psychometric & reasoning skills of the student and has straightforward questions, the only catch being that you get significantly less time. The other section focuses on the Core knowledge of your respective Department, and one can easily crack this section if they have the gist of the core Department Subjects.\n\nb. Group Discussion: This could be the crucial part of the assessment as a group consists of 6 to 8 students. Two topics were put forward by the panel one after the other:\n\n1. Tata Acquisition of Air India\n\n2. The current value of Paint Industries in India\n\nOne must feel free to express their views to the panel within 15 minutes, and the topics majorly revolve around current Industrial news and happenings.\n\nc. Interview: A Handful of students were shortlisted after the first two rounds, and a final call with the Company executive was held, where he majorly asked a few HR Questions, discussion on past projects and internships, CV grilling, and some tricky questions to test the student's alignment toward the core disciplines. This round lasted roughly 20 minutes.\n\nHow to prepare for them?\n\nOne has to be thorough with the concepts of their core discipline. For Metallurgy students, Basic Extractive Metallurgy, Iron and Steelmaking, and the fundamentals of thermodynamics are essential topics.\n\nSolving core Metallurgical engineering and aptitude questions for the Assessment round would be good enough to get through it.\n\nFor the GD round, one must know current Industrial news and a little company background. More than 50% of students get eliminated this round, and one must provide sound reasoning for their views and initiate the discussion.\n\nFor the interview, one should be able to explain everything mentioned in the CV. One should be clear with all aspects of the projects/internships they have done. The students should have a thorough idea of the company beforehand to quickly drive the interview and express their interests to the interviewer.\n\nResources I have followed: Resources for CDC Preparation (you can find the resources for every profile here)\n\nWhat difficulties did you face while preparing for this Company/Profile? How did you overcome this problem?\n\nBefore the start of CDC, I was a little uncertain about the profile as I have explored both the software and Management profiles and found interest in both. I prepared for both of them and kept SDE as my backup profile.\n\nDuring the CDC phase, I find it a little difficult to practice for both profiles and maintain consistency, so I suggest everyone better stick to one profile if possible, or if you are interested in multiple profiles, prioritize them and keep one as the backup because it's challenging to master multiple profiles within the short time, given you won\u2019t get enough time to practice for each profile.\n\nAccording to you, who should ideally apply for this job?\n\nAlthough JSW is a core company, the work here primarily revolves around many businesses like Sales & Marketing, Operations, CSR, Supply Chain Management, E-Commerce, and many more business verticals.\n\nOne must utilize Core domain knowledge and Problem-Solving skills to solve real-life Industrial Problems, significantly impacting the industrial turnout.\n\nPeople interested in the above-mentioned Techno-Managerial Domains are suitable for applying to this role.\n\nAny specific advice you want to give to the junta sitting for internships this year?\n\nCommonly, the companies visiting this target profile (Core/Management) are very few, and there is massive competition for these companies. Do not feel disheartened if you don't receive a shortlist or cannot make it through all the assessment rounds. There are many off-campus opportunities.\n\nStay in touch with your parents, friends and constantly seek their guidance if you feel like giving up.\n\nRemember, you possess unique skills and qualities that make you a strong candidate. Stay focused on your goals and maintain a positive mindset. It can be beneficial to seek guidance from seniors who have successfully gone through similar experiences. Their insights and advice can provide valuable perspectives and help you navigate the process more effectively. Keep pushing forward, stay determined, and believe in yourself; success is within reach.\n\nI recommend that everyone read the job description before applying or consult seniors who have worked in that particular company to know about the work culture beforehand, as you cannot apply to every company that has visited the campus.\n\nWhat are some of the major points you think would be valid to mention in your CV while targeting this profile?\n\nManagerial Companies usually look for an all-rounder personality who has many skills besides their academics. Some of the points to be mentioned in your CV are:\n\nProjects & Internships: Highlight significant projects you have completed, emphasizing your role and accomplishments.\n\nPublications or term papers: If applicable, include any research papers, articles, or presentations you have authored or delivered.\n\nPositions of Responsibility: Although very few companies look into these (unless you are from any cell or hold Gymkhana managerial post), it reflects your leadership skills, managerial techniques, and more.\n\nRemember to tailor your CV to the specific role you're applying for, highlighting the most relevant experiences and skills that align with the profile's requirements.\n\nHere\u2019s wishing all the very best to the CDC junta this year!

        "content": "FORESIGHT(2023): Summer Internship at Goldman Sachs | Himadri Pandya |\n\n--\n\nListen\n\n1) Brief Introduction\n\nHi Everyone! I am Himadri Pandya, a 4th-year undergraduate student of the Department of Mechanical Engineering. I am a boarder of Sarojini Naidu/Indira Gandhi Hall of residence. I sat for the CDC Internship drive last year and have joined Goldman Sachs as a Summer Analyst for the summer of 2023.\n\n2) How did you get into GS? What was the selection procedure?\n\nIt\u2019s fair to say that Goldman Sachs was my highest preferred company throughout my CDC preparation, after the shortlists and during the interviews. I focused my preparation around GS all throughout the summers and started solely preparing for the interviews once I was certain that I had performed well in the test and was expecting to get shortlisted for the interviews.\n\nThe selection procedure consisted of:\n\na. Test (for shortlisting): The test had 4 sections which were timed separately:\n\nb. Coding Section: This section had two medium to hard coding questions to be attempted in C++\n\nc. Probability, Statistics and Puzzles: This section had 25 questions on probability and statistics including a few easy puzzles\n\nd. Essay Question: This section was for language fluency in which we had to write a short paragraph on a given topic\n\ne. Computer Architecture: This section had around 20 questions on core CS topics including operating systems and algorithms\n\nf. Personal Interviews: I had two rounds of technical interviews (some people had three rounds) on Zoom where I was asked logic-based puzzles and questions on probability and statistics. They asked me the logic I would use to implement certain coding questions but I wasn\u2019t asked to explicitly code anything. It started off with easy questions and progressed towards more difficult questions. I was called to a meet after these two rounds to confirm the offer.\n\n3) How to prepare for them?\n\n4) What difficulties did you face while preparing for this Company/ Profile? How did you overcome this problem?\n\nThe difficulties that I faced were primarily centered around the time that I was able to give to the preparation because of my extra-curricular involvements in KGP and the fact that I started my preparation a bit later than others. You shouldn\u2019t face any of these problems for this particular role if you\u2019ve been consistent and disciplined throughout your preparation\n\nOther than that, I\u2019d suggest you contact seniors who have prepared for similar roles that you are interested in and get insights from them. Being connected will give you a more channeled approach and will also be a constant mental support when you need it.\n\n5) According to you, who should ideally apply for this job?\n\nThe selection procedure revolves around problem solving abilities so folks with a natural knack for coding and logic-based puzzles have a slight edge in the entire process. However, one can conveniently prepare for all the sections by planning out their preparation well and following the deadlines they set for themselves. The internship majorly involves coding so if you\u2019re someone who hates programming then this possibly isn\u2019t the best option out there.\n\nRegardless, it\u2019s a sought-after day 1 role and a great option for those opting for tech profiles.\n\n6) Any specific advice you want to give to the junta sitting for internships this year.\n\nIn general for tech roles, coding is very important and should ideally take up at least 80% of your prep time. It is very important to plan how much time you will be devoting to each question during the tests. Try to gauge if you will be able to solve the question immediately after reading it or if you\u2019ll have to go for a partial solution and thus a partial score.\n\nYour performance in the test is an essential data point both before and during your interview and has a role on how they perceive you throughout given the limited information they are given. So it is preferable to try to perform exceedingly well in the tests to have a good pre-impression on the interviewer. In fact, it is practically improbable to interview for more than two companies on a given day so your focus should not be to get multiple shortlists but to get preferable shortlists in the companies you\u2019re genuinely interested in. It is better to perform \u201cvery well\u201d in a few tests and disastrously in the others and getting 2 shortlists than performing \u201cdecently\u201d in multiple companies and getting multiple inconvertible shortlists.\n\nAs for the interviews, be very clear about your preferences in case you have multiple shortlists. By the end of the tests you should be able to get a fair idea of whether or not you have a chance of getting shortlisted for a given company. Once you\u2019re ready with your preferences your sole focus should be to prepare for interviews and contact as many seniors as possible to understand what type of questions are asked and be certain about evaluations metrics for various companies. For example, I was shortlisted to interview for LEK but was fairly certain about getting a shortlist at GS and since I was clear about my preferences I devoted all my time to prepare for GS while skipping any and all case prep.\n\nOther than that, once you are certain about a shortlist in a few of your highly preferred companies you can consider skipping a few tests to prepare for the interviews of your preferred companies. It can be somewhat categorized as a gamble but if done correctly it can give you a very sharp edge during interview preparation since you\u2019ll have to draw a line for preferences at some point anyway. Better sooner, than later.\n\n7) What are some of the major points you think would be valid to mention in your CV while targeting this profile?(any specific suggestions you would like to make?)"

What was the selection procedure?\n\nAfter applying through ERP, we had to apply for the role in the company\u2019s portal as well. The first step of the selection procedure comprises online gamified assessments which consist of various types of challenges such as grid challenge, digit challenge, switch challenge, etc. There are unlimited levels and you need to get as many correct as possible. If you clear this round, you\u2019ll get another link for an assessment that consists of behavioral and situational-type questions.\n\nFinally, they released a shortlist of around 20 students for Group Interviews ( 3 candidates in each panel) followed by a HR round on Day 1 with further shortlisted candidates.\n\nHow to prepare for them?\n\nThe psychometric test consists of general aptitude-based questions and so there isn\u2019t much you can do to specifically prepare for them. You can have a look at basic puzzles, practice quick math, etc. My suggestion would be to attempt the test in a quiet and focused environment free from distractions. The second test consists of situational and behavioral type questions in which you have to stick to your ideology while keeping in mind the values of the company and answering the questions. I would suggest you to go through the company\u2019s website and understand its principles and values.\n\nThe group interview consists of questions where you would be asked to cite some situations from your previous experiences( be it your internships, POR\u2019s or academic achievements) and how you went about solving the problem at hand. The key here is to answer in a concise manner keeping in mind the CAR( Context, Action, Response) framework. The other type of questions is where they\u2019ll ask you to assume yourselves in a particular situation and then try to find possible solutions. Remember to never cut off your fellow interviewees while they are speaking and listen carefully to their responses as well.\n\nHR round consists of basic questions on your introduction and is a chance to interact with the interviewer on his experience in the company and also telling him about your motivation for the internship. You should always ask some questions to the interviewer here, which could be about the role, the company, or the industry in general.\n\nWhat difficulties did you face while preparing for this Company/Profile? How did you overcome this problem?\n\nThe preparation for this profile varies from company to company. My interview at P&G did not focus on core engineering knowledge but was more inclined towards evaluating my decision-making abilities in various situations with a focus on cultural fit as well. However, the same is not true for other FMCG companies like HUL and ITC. My suggestion here would be to prepare some basic concepts of your engineering discipline and familiarise yourselves with a bit of supply chain knowledge in order to prepare for the profile and reach out to seniors who have interned in these companies in the past for relevant preparation advice.\n\nAccording to you, who should ideally apply for this job?\n\nThe role of Product Supply offered by P&G is super diverse and typically pertains to working on various innovation-driven optimization opportunities within the company spreading across functions. The role involves techno-managerial work with an understanding of the technicalities of the industry and coming up with solutions to various challenges. Anyone who enjoys solving problems at scale, and optimizing various technicalities of the industry would be a good fit.\n\nAny specific advice you want to give to the junta sitting for internships this year?\n\nOne of the most important things is to keep believing in yourself throughout the process. You must be clear about what you want out of this process and be specific about the roles you are targeting. Always stay connected with relevant seniors for resources/mock interviews and a group of friends preparing for similar profiles for collaborative preparation. The process of CDC can sometimes be unpredictable and uncertain, but always keep your cool and keep working.\n\nWhat are some of the major points you think would be valid to mention in your CV while targeting this profile?(any specific suggestions you would like)\n\nProjects or internships related to supply chain or industrial optimization are a plus. Also, they prefer previous techno-managerial experiences, so mentioning your POR\u2019s on campus will give you an upper edge. Projects or competitions on environmental sustainability are also worth mentioning.\n\nHere\u2019s wishing all the very best to the CDC junta this year!

        "content": "FORESIGHT(2023): Summer Internship at Honeywell |Rithick Prabakar|\n\n--\n\nListen\n\nBrief Introduction\n\nHello folks! I am Rithick Prabakar, a third-year undergraduate student in the Department of Mechanical Engineering. I will join Honeywell as an SDE intern in the summer of 2023.\n\nHow did you get into Honeywell? What was the selection procedure?\n\nThe first round was the preliminary coding round. It was conducted on Hackerrank and consisted of 3 questions. All three were pretty easy if one has had a decent amount of practice. Then I had my technical interview and HR round. At first, a straightforward question was asked. After answering it, the question was modified into a more complex one. After solving that one, I was asked to explain my ongoing research project. Next, I was called for the HR round. It was concluded with a \"Do you have any questions for us?\" and a call from CDC confirming the offer.\n\nHow to prepare for them?\n\nThe first step for a software profile is a good grasp of data structures and algorithms. Here are some of the great resources I found: -\n\nIntroduction to Algorithms MIT OCW (This is gold! Make sure to follow the latest playlist for updated algorithms)\n\nIntroduction to Algorithms book by Thomas H Cormen et al. (This is an excellent book for theory. You know, for the people who love to read the book after the lecture. Amazing if you read it. If you have no motivation for a giant book, not much loss.)\n\nYou have the gist of all the algorithms and data structures by now. Now the next best thing is to focus on relevant topics rather than learning everything in detail. If you program in Python, that's good, but learning CPP would be significant. The reason is that it's a low-level language than Python and is excellent for coding the answers (STL is paradise). But always go with your most confident programming language. To learn CPP, I'd suggest the following videos:\n\nComplete CPP (This course covers everything, including OOPs concepts, implementing them, and all advanced CPP)\n\nShorter CPP(If you are overwhelmed by 31 hours, then these 4 hours cover all the core concepts needed for you to build your skills)\n\nSTL Video (This guy explains complete STL and implements them in C++. Awesome!)\n\nSTL\u00a0(Don't feel like watching too many videos? Then use this to learn the ultimate power of CPP)\n\nFrom the above resources, you covered everything needed to indulge in specific topics. The above would equip you from a complete starter to writing your code. The important topics are Dynamic Programming or DP, Graphs, Bit manipulation, Trees, and Heaps.\n\nDynamic Programming (Common DP questions with code)\n\nGraphs (Common Graph questions with code)\n\nBit Manipulation (It pretty much covers all the necessary tactics for bit manipulation needed for coding tests)\n\nAnd finally, read about code readability. It would greatly help while coding to keep track. With these, you have all the necessary knowledge of DSA. And while doing all this, you can do either of the two things. Suppose you have a lot of time (more than 5 months). In that case, giving contests in CodeForces is an excellent way to acquaint yourself with solving questions in time constraints.\n\nYou will also gain a ton of confidence to solve questions. But if you start preparing during the summers for interns, it would be challenging to solve more than 3 questions in Div. 2. And of course, if you can, keep going. Else it would kill the confidence. Rather than giving contests, focus on solving them from the archive with ratings sorted. This would provide a lot of confidence (confidence does wonders). To get habituated to solving questions under time constraints, Grimoire of Code does weekly contests with previous year CDC questions (kudos!). On top of it, a time-to-time contest from Codeforces/CodeChef for the time-constraint practice.\n\nLastly, Interviewbit bucket questions. Leetcode substitutes too. They have the previous year's questions appropriately sorted and only a handful. While doing theory, coding them simultaneously dramatically helps when wholly dedicated to solving questions. Some extra resources are given below:\n\nCP Algorithms (All CP things in sorted manner)\n\nNumber Theory(Number theory)\n\nCracking the coding interview by McDowell (For interview questions + HR questions)\n\nTips and Tricks for Interview (Most interview tips and tricks are compiled into one post)\n\nWhatever you do, be very consistent. Consistency is the key. Also, don't neglect core cs concepts like Operating Systems and Database Management Systems. OOPS too. There are a good number of resources available for them.\n\nWhat difficulties did you face while preparing for this Company/Profile? How did you overcome this problem?\n\nI had no problems with the algorithm's theory part. I have been involved in them since my high school. But the major problem was that I had no programming practice. I had a fantastic grip on CPP, so the only problem was implementing the algorithms. Even with plenty of time, I didn't show consistency in CodeForces or CodeChef (5 or 6 contests). When CDC arrived, I realized I had wasted a lot of opportunities. The only programming practice I had was in HackerRank. To overcome this, I totally focused on interviewbit and GoC contests. This gave me the base to code my paper-written algorithms. In conclusion, code what you learn simultaneously.\n\nAccording to you, who should ideally apply for this job?\n\nI haven't yet done my internship, so I wouldn't specify anything. But on a gist, it's for people interested in software, programming, and problem-solving.\n\nAny specific advice you want to give to the junta sitting for internships this year.\n\nDon't be overwhelmed by the entire CDC process. A lot of factors might demotivate you. You might have tests late at night and interviews in the early morning. To refresh, hang out with friends, do a 2.2, and take a chill pill. If you face any issues, reach out to your friends and seniors. Stay away from Facebook and LinkedIn, if possible.\n\nDon't lose heart if you are rejected. Face it. For all the work you have done, for all the efforts you have put in, you will definitely get what you deserve. Remember that CDC is just another phase and will eventually pass. It is not the end.\n\nWhat are some of the major points you think would be valid to mention in your CV while targeting this profile? (any specific suggestions you would like to make?)\n\nRelevant projects for the profile are always a great point. That also includes your self-projects and internships. If they are relevant to SDE, then adding them is good. Adding your CF/CC rating is always a plus. That also includes your code jam/hash code/Hackercup highest ranks. Group projects show you are a good team player. Relevant hackathons also offer your competitive skill. Remember, you might be questioned about whatever is written on your curriculum vitae. Get your CV reviewed by seniors to improve them."

I\u2019m a boarder of Nehru Hall and currently live in Gurgaon.\n\nHow did you get into APT? What was the selection procedure?\n\nThe first stage was a 2-hour online coding test. The test comprised 6 coding questions, no MCQs or anything else. I would estimate the question complexity to span 1400\u20131800 Codeforces rating or so, the questions were definitely of a slightly higher level than the average CDC coding test that season. I did quite well in the test \u2014 in the ballpark of 3 or 4 fully correct questions and the remaining having between 60 and 80% test cases passing, and was moderately confident about expecting a shortlist.\n\nShortlists were announced based on test performance (possibly including some contribution from the resume, I have no information about that). I had filled APT as my priority so had my first round of interviews at 8 am. The first interview was on Google Meet with a shared Hackerrank link, where I had to run my code to demonstrate correctness. There were no formal test cases, the interviewer verbally described some to me or asked me to come up with them myself and write some minimal boilerplate code to run my solution against them. The round was entirely based on trees. I was first asked about the different traversals and had to implement one. Then, I was asked to write an algorithm to edit the tree so that the in-order traversal of the new tree was equal to the pre-order traversal of the original, or something similar. I developed a solution using an external stack which the interviewer was surprised to find out. After I demonstrated correctness and implemented his test case, he asked me to optimize away this space usage by reusing pointers within the tree. I took some time here but with some hints, I was able to implement a solution. I was asked one final modification to this question which I only verbally described as we were out of time. The interview overran the timeslot and lasted 65 minutes, immediately after which I was asked to join the next round.\n\nThe next round was a change of pace as it did not involve CP at all \u2014 it was entirely based on logic puzzles such as those on Brainstellar and math questions. I was able to do most questions well, but one of the math questions was proving a theorem about the subsets of a set of numbers and I took a lot of hints and time to reach the end of it. This single question probably took 30+ minutes in the interview. I was quite disheartened during this, and I think my saving grace was that I was constantly thinking out loud so the interviewer could see that I was trying many different approaches (which might have been incorrect but were something). Toward the end of the interview, I was asked a singular non-technical question about \u201cWhy Quant?\u201d I responded by saying it lay at the intersection of my interests in Machine Learning, Algorithms, and Securities Markets. This round also lasted ~one hour, and within 5\u201310 minutes of it ending, I was called back for a third round.\n\nThe third round had a mix of small CP questions that I was asked to verbally describe my approach to (along with time/space complexity analysis), along with some more puzzles and math questions. One of the math questions again involved a multi-stage proof about coloring points on a 2D plane and I was able to solve all versions of it, with some hints. The interview also ended with the same question about \u201cWhy Quant?\u201d and I was told at the end to expect a decision within an hour. Around 40 minutes later I was called by the Placecomm member who was coordinating interviews at APT and informed of my offer.\n\nHow to prepare for them?\n\nI think preparation for this role at APT should revolve around Competitive Programming. As I\u2019ve mentioned, CP was crucial for both the coding round as well as two out of three interviews I had. In general, my experience was that quant roles or even SDE roles at quant firms had higher levels of questions in their online coding rounds so practicing questions around the 1600\u20131800 level would be my recommendation.\n\nThe interview puzzles were largely standard ones and preparing from Brainstellar and Heard on the Street should be sufficient. In my opinion, one quick round of these resources can be done before test season and major prep can be done in parallel with the tests or as part of targeted interview prep for this role (more on this approach in the specific advise section). TED-Ed\u2019s riddles videos are also a great resource for these questions.\n\nWhat difficulties did you face while preparing for this Company/Profile? How did you overcome this problem?\n\nDifficulties arose from my not being clear on whether to target Quant or SDE profiles early on. I was preparing for both and only at the very end did I decide to put the Quant firms higher on my priority list. Owing to this, I spent less time on puzzles than I probably should have, but it worked out in the end. I was also limited in the number of Quant opportunities available for my branch, which reduced the margin of error I was allowed in the coding tests.\n\nAside from this, I ramped up my preparation late as I was (for some reason) expecting the CDC timeline to be a month or so later than it was. Due to this, I was still polishing my CP skills during the tests instead of targeted interview prep which that time should ideally be reserved for.\n\nAccording to you, who should ideally apply for this job?\n\nThe selection procedure is tilted towards CP so people with experience and who find coding fun have an edge. The puzzles asked in the interview can be conveniently prepared for but I\u2019m not sure how one would prepare for the ad-hoc math questions. To that extent, the procedure is more kind to people who might have a natural knack for logical or game-based puzzles, and so on.\n\nThe actual work is likely to involve a mix of Machine Learning/Data-based systems, designing and implementing algorithms, and possibly some amount of knowledge in Securities/Derivatives markets. People who find these fields interesting and have some prior experience or at least basic knowledge are likely to be more suited.\n\nRegardless, it\u2019s a fairly coveted day 1 role and a lot of people targeting tech roles might find it interesting and enriching to apply for.\n\nAny specific advice you want to give to the junta sitting for internships this year?\n\nThis is advice geared toward tech roles.\n\nFor coding rounds: Go for partial solutions. Especially for the harder tests (quant companies in general), try and determine as soon as you read the problem if you can solve it fully or will have to go for a partial score. You mustn\u2019t waste a lot of time on the full solution of a particular question at the expense of submitting partials to multiple questions which would\u2019ve net you a higher score. If you have a good sense of this early, you can do the full solutions you\u2019re comfortable with along with partials for the rest of the questions in the first pass, and then return to the question you have the fewest passing test cases or the question where you might have the highest chance of improving to a full or even a better-partial solution.\n\nAside from this, one more learning is that doing \u201cdecent\u201d/\u201cgood\u201d in all tests is not a useful goal. Even if you get shortlisted for everything, you can only seriously interview for only one or two (at most 3) companies/roles on a particular Day. To this end, having 2\u20133 really good tests and disastrous performance on the rest is far better than having \u201cgood\u201d performance on all tests.\n\nFor interviews: By the time you\u2019re towards the end of the test season, you should have some idea of how well you\u2019ve done in each test and have a list of expected shortlists. Some brutal honesty would be good here and I would recommend dividing the roles into \u201chighly likely\u201d, \u201cmaybe\u201d, and \u201chighly unlikely\u201d in terms of shortlist probability. Of course, these are based on others\u2019 performance and as well so some idea of the baseline difficulty of the test vs your performance needs to be sought. These lists should be made on a rolling basis as tests happen and once you have a few companies which are \u201cmaybe\u201d or better, you should start laser-focused interview prep for the 2\u20133 companies you aspire for and are hoping for shortlists at. I highly recommend contacting seniors who interned at these firms via Facebook and asking them in as much detail as possible about what was asked in their interviews. For example, I was very confident of a DE Shaw shortlist so I reached out to seniors and prepared OOPS in that last week just for their interview. I did not end up interviewing with them finally, but if I had walked in with only CP prep I likely would\u2019ve been well out of my depth.\n\nI also think towards the end, if you have a few of your highest-priority companies in the \u201chighly likely\u201d list, it might be useful to stop giving the online tests and dedicate this time to interview prep. This is something I did at the very end and probably should have done a little sooner.\n\nWhat are some of the major points you think would be valid to mention in your CV while targeting this profile? (any specific suggestions you would like to make?)\n\nNot sure how relevant the CV is for this profile. It wasn\u2019t brought up even once across all 3 interviews and I wasn\u2019t asked to talk about any prior experience in my introduction. I think general tech CV advice should hold \u2014 prioritize technical experience/work at the expense of co-curricular on the CV, more relevant technologies to the role are better so try and customize CVs between quant-data and SDE roles, etc. Additionally, try to include ratings on Codeforces/other CP websites, it may not be that impactful for this role but is for other tech ones."

        "content": "FORESIGHT(2023): Summer Internship at Google | Rashi Patil |\n\n--\n\nListen\n\n1) Brief Introduction\n\nHello everyone! I\u2019m Rashi Patil, a third-year undergraduate student from the Department of Electronics and Electrical Communication Engineering enrolled in its B.Tech course. I am a Boarder of SN/IG Hall of Residence. I got an internship offer from Google through the on-campus CDC drive last year (2022\u201323).\n\n2) How did you get into Google? What was the selection procedure?\n\nGoogle opens only for Students with Majors in Circuital departments (CS, ECE, EE, MnC, and IM) \u201cand/or\u201d Minors in Circuital departments \u201cand/or\u201d Micro specializations in Circuital courses. The selection process involved one coding round followed by two technical interview rounds. The coding test was conducted on the HackerEarth platform in which two questions were given to solve in 60 mins. Later, based on your score on the test and your CV, shortlisted people are allotted some panels for interviews.\n\nRound-1 (45 min): The interview started with an introduction. After this, I was given a medium-level 2-pointer problem. I quickly explained my logic and then jumped to the implementation. After this, the interviewer asked me a follow-up question about a K-pointer scenario. I went on to extend my 2-pointer solution to a k-pointer problem while discussing it with the interviewer and came up with a solution. Although, due to time constraints, I couldn\u2019t implement the solution completely, the interviewer seemed happy and satisfied with my logic.\n\nRound-2 (45 min): The interview started with an introduction. After this, I was given a medium-level Dynamic Programming problem. I quickly explained my logic and then jumped to the implementation. The interviewer went on to ask a few tricky questions related to the STLs I was using in my implementation. After completing the implementation, the interviewer asked me a follow-up question, to which we discussed a few approaches and came up with a greedy solution. He didn\u2019t ask me to code it.\n\nBoth the interviewers were quite friendly and helpful.\n\n3) How to prepare for them?\n\nA thorough understanding of algorithms and data structures is required for software engineering-based profiles. Once the basics of DSA are clear, there are many sources to practice problem-solving. If you are a beginner, then refer to Leetcode and InterviewBit. Once you feel confident in standard DSA, you can participate in competitive programming contests on codeforces to boost your problem-solving ability.\n\nFor Google, much importance is given to the candidate\u2019s resume, especially past Kickstart/Codejam performances. So, make sure to participate in these contests.\n\nCS core concepts like OOPS, DBMS, OS, etc., are also recommended if you are aiming for Day-1 or Day-2 companies. If you have a rough idea about them, you can just keep these for the end and prepare them two weeks before the interviews. Although Google doesn\u2019t ask these in any round but some companies do.\n\n4) What difficulties did you face while preparing for this Company/Profile? How did you overcome this problem\n\nToo much to prepare in less time, I overcame this problem by carefully designing my study plan for the entire summer vacation before CDC. Also, there were times when I felt stuck and demotivated; maintaining consistency at such times was very challenging. In fact, I used to read such blogs of students who got internships through the CDC to keep myself motivated. I didn\u2019t feel very confident in the dynamic programming-related problems. So, to overcome this, I moved to leetcode and solved enough questions until I felt confident in it.\n\n5) According to you, who should ideally apply for this job?\n\nThis profile is recommended for anyone who is good at problem-solving and enjoys coding and software development. There is a lot of scope for learning new technologies and skills during the internship.\n\n6) Any specific advice you want to give to the junta sitting for internships this year?\n\nStart preparing a bit early on, and be consistent throughout your preparation journey. Try to solve as many problems as you can while understanding the logic deeply to the roots of every problem. Give more contests on codeforces/CodeChef and get a hold of CP. The journey will be challenging, fun, and sometimes stressful. There will be times when you will feel demotivated. Don\u2019t give up, and keep pushing forward. Make a group and practice; this will help with motivation. Plan your journey well so that you can utilize your time to the fullest. Keep revising the concepts you study.\n\nTry to stay confident and happy in the interviews. The interviewer mainly wants to judge how well you think and approach a problem. It is very important that while thinking about the problem\u2019s solution, you think out loud.\n\nKeep talking with the interviewer about your approach so that even if you go wrong, he can give you a hint to get you back on track.\n\nAll the best, Everyone!\n\n7) What are some of the major points you think would be valid to mention in your CV while targeting this profile? (Any specific suggestions you would like to make?)\n\nProjects and internships indicate hands-on experience, which interviewers generally take good note of. Projects can be anything from self-projects to course projects. Try to participate in as many programming contests as possible and write those ranks/ratings that will be useful during shortlisting. PoRs aren\u2019t really required for this profile.\n\nBe honest with what you represent in your CV. Be ready to be grilled upon anything you write on the CV."

        "content": "FORESIGHT(2023): Summer Internship at Morgan Stanley| Priyansha Gupta |\n\n--\n\nListen\n\nMy name is Priyansha Gupta. I am a pre-final undergraduate student of the Department of Humanities and Social Sciences enrolled in its 5-year Integrated M.Sc. Economics program. I am also pursuing a minor in Mathematics and Computing. I am a boarder of Mother Teresa Hall of Residence. I am from Jabalpur, Madhya Pradesh. Talking about my previous experience, I have previously interned at Godrej Capital on a research project in the Unsecured Business Loans division. I also did an internship at ISB at the Centre of Analytical Finance. I held the position of UG Department Representative for the session 2022-23.\n\n2. How did you get into Morgan Stanley? What was the selection procedure?\n\nI was interested in going into my core. So, the best option for me was Investment Banking or finance, as we call it in KGP. But broadly, I applied for Consult, Finance and Analytics.\n\nTalking about the selection procedure, there was a test. The test had 7 sections, as I remember. The test duration was around two and a half hours. The sections were Mental Ability, Mathematics or Probability and Statistics, English, Finance, Speaking, Listening and Coding. Mental Ability and Maths questions were of easy level. English could be a little difficult as they asked for Synonyms, Antonyms and those kinds of things, but the paragraph-based questions can be solved easily. In finance, there were 15 questions in 15 minutes, so it was more about speed. Speaking test is like we must read some sentences in a given time with proper pronunciation, and in 1 question, I had to talk about a given topic for 45 seconds. They gave me 10 seconds to think about it, so it was just about quick thinking and speaking properly. In the Listening test, there will be an audio clip and then questions based on them, so we must listen properly and remember because the audio cannot be played again. Coding questions were implementation based and of easy level; if we practice DSA properly, they can be solved. Coding questions might help increase the overall score but are not counted in Sales in Trading profile as such. For shortlisting, they consider the test score, CG and CV as well. They shortlisted people with CG above 9 and who had some background in finance (related interns or projects). The interview consisted of 3 rounds. The first 2 were technical; they asked a lot of questions related to interns and projects and specific finance questions related to them. They asked some general finance questions as well. Be updated on the latest finance and business news around the world. You should also be thorough with any finance concept included in your CV related to any intern or project. The HR round is also quite crucial, in my opinion. Quick thinking is required if any situation-based question is asked, and instead of one-way answering, interacting with the HR helps.\n\n3. How to prepare for them?\n\nFor Mathematics/Probability and Statistics, practice from 50 Challenging problems in Probability, heard on the Street and Brainstellar might also help. For finance, they asked questions about many concepts, so brushing up on basic concepts by reading from Investopedia, Zerodha and CFA materials will help. Obviously, all of the finance cannot be covered, so at least remembering the basics and the basic formulas will help. As far as I remember, most of the questions were about financial ratios. For the speaking and listening test, no preparation is required as such, but watching some English movies without subtitles could be a good practice, XD. Doing basic to intermediate-level DSA problems from GFG or Leetcode should be enough for Coding questions. CP per se is not required. Guesstimates were not asked in my interview, but they could be asked, so it would be better to practice a few of them. For the interview rounds, thorough knowledge of everything in the CV is necessary. The interviewers were very friendly, so if you get stuck somewhere, you can discuss it with them. The interview goes very smoothly if we keep talking to the interviewer instead of doing it as a Q&A. Being updated with the business and financial news is required, so reading financial news one month beforehand will help.\n\n4. What difficulties did you face while preparing for this company/profile? How did you overcome this problem?\n\nOne of the biggest difficulties for me was that I did not have any PORs required for both finance and consulting. Morgan Stanley came for intern for the first time this year to campus. It never came before, so there was no company-specific preparation. I could not just go and get a POR in 3 months while preparing for CDC, so I kept some backup options like Analytics or ML and prepared for them also. Also, maintaining a high CG helps. And I had a relevant finance background through interns and projects, so that helped too.\n\n5. According to you, who should ideally apply for this internship?\n\nThe Sales and Trading role is purely based on fixed-income financial instruments, so people interested in hard-core finance and investment banking should apply.\n\n6. Any specific advice you want to give to the junta sitting for placements this year?\n\nI want to advise my juniors that it is better not to make CDC intern too big of a deal. I admit that is very important, but you will not get anything out of it if you are not actually learning anything or building a skill set. If you keep learning and exploring things, you will end up in a good place. It is just a very good opportunity given to us. But it is not the end of the world too. Your learnings and skill set are the only things that will help you in the long run. Good preparation will help you in bagging an intern. But even apart from CDC, there are tons of opportunities out there. You just have to keep exploring to find the role which excites you. Also, it is better to apply for roles you are actually interested in, instead of just running to get an internship anywhere.\n\nPrepare well for your internship. Be confident in yourself; having the appropriate know-how helps in building up confidence. Do smart-work instead of hard work; goal-oriented preparation always helps as long as you are learning and enjoying the process. Like I said before, keeping a high CG will always help in any profile you sit for. Finance companies take people from all departments, so the department is not a barrier. Having some relevant PORs might also help, but running for PORs just for the sake of getting an internship will only be a waste of time. Just keep an open mind and prepare well. I wish you all the very best for your upcoming internship season. You can reach out for any more queries. I would be more than happy to help."

I am from the Department of Electrical Engineering enrolled in its B. Tech course. During the CDC Internship drive, I received an internship from Bain and Co. at their New Delhi (Gurugram) office.\n\n2) How did you get into Bain & Company? What was the selection procedure?\n\nSo this was the first time Bain and Co. came to campus to offer the ACI role (Associate Consultant Intern). The selection process comprised 3 major segments. The first was CV shortlisting; this is where all your past experiences, extracurriculars, PORs and achievements are evaluated. Next up, after CVs were shortlisted, we had the Buddy Sessions wherein a Buddy (i.e. a person working in Bain) is allotted to you, with whom you can prepare for the upcoming interviews; this involves case prep and guesstimate prep. Post the buddy round, we had a manager interview and then finally a partner round which mainly included questions from your CV and general HR questions and one case or guesstimate.\n\n3) How to prepare for them?\n\nIn order to prepare for the interview process at Bain, there are two things that one must prepare for: Guesstimates and Business Cases. There is no such extensive preparation that is required for consulting interviews. You just have to be very articulate, clear and have good quantitative abilities. So to prepare for these, I used majorly two books during the last 2 weeks before my interviews: Case Interviews Cracked (CIC \u2014 IIT Bombay) and Day 1 (IIT Madras). Guesstimates can also be practised from the same books. However, more than just the \u201cbook\u201d oriented prep, it is more important to have an overall case prep in groups. So it is always advised to make a small group of people who would sit together daily and prepare for these cases and guesstimates. This is a process where one person is the interviewer and asks the other (interviewee) to proceed with the case or the guesstimate.\n\n4) What difficulties did you face while preparing for this Company/Profile? How did you overcome this problem?\n\nMajorly the problems I faced while preparing for interviews at Bain was that this was the first time it was coming to campus, so there were no seniors to talk to about what the process is actually like and what all happens during the process, so I had to contact ACIs from other IITs and talk to them about how the process proceeds further. Secondly, finding a case group is a challenging task, where everyone is motivated enough for consulting case prep and wants to take time out.\n\n5) According to you, who should ideally apply for this job?\n\nThis job is basically for people who like to solve business problems, have business acumen and have a slight analytical background. Also, no specific skill set is required for a management consulting job, so nothing as such is needed like other roles of finance, quant or SDE.\n\n6) Any specific advice you want to give to the junta sitting for internships this year.\n\nAdvice from my end would be that CDC is a very challenging and long process that takes a lot of toll on one\u2019s mental and emotional health. I just want everyone to be part of groups, prepare together and stay in touch with seniors and mentors throughout the process. Also, it is essential to understand that a particular company might always be the right fit for you, and that can be grounds for rejection as well, and you never have to take rejections personally.\n\n7) Kindly attach your resume. What are some of the major points you think would be valid to mention in your CV while targeting this profile?(any specific suggestions you would like to make?)\n\nSo CV is one of the most important aspects of the selection process at Bain. They would generally look for peaks in order to shortlist CVs."

        "content": "FORESIGHT(2023): Summer Internship at AWL | Shubham Kulkarni |\n\n--\n\nListen\n\n1 : Brief Introduction\n\nHello everyone, My name is Shubham Kulkarni and I am a third year undergraduate student in the department of Electronics and Electrical Communication Engineering enrolled in its BTech course.\n\nI am interning as an AI engineer at AWL, Inc. this summer of 2023, which I received via CDC internships 2022\u201323.\n\n2 : How did you get into AWL ? What was the selection procedure?\n\nAWL visited our campus on day 3 and there were a total of 2 rounds.\n\nThe test was two hours long and had quite a few sections covering questions across various domains such as probability and statistics, aptitude and machine learning. Along with these there were 4 programming questions of intermediate level based mostly on topics like graphs and dynamic programming.\n\n2. Interview Round -\n\n3 : How to prepare for them?\n\nFrom my experience, your CV is rather important for this profile. You should have a few internships or projects or competitions on your CV showcasing that you have some previous experience in ML. If you don\u2019t have any internships or projects, you can opt for some good self-projects or some competitions such as on kaggle or other platforms. Competitions such as General Championship, OpenIIT or some other inter-college competition will also work.\n\nYou also need to do DSA and practice competitive programming as almost all of the companies for data/ML profile ask coding questions in their test rounds. A lot of students opt for the Algozenith course which is pretty good. But I personally did it by watching different YouTube videos and reading articles such as on GFG. For practicing your coding skills Inteviewbit is a good platform.\n\nFor the ML concepts, if you are just starting with ML you can do a few good courses on Coursera and Udemy. Some recommendations will be the Andrew NG ML and DL courses on coursera and ML A-Z course on Udemy. However, it will be much more effective if you do some projects using different ML algorithms. This will give you a better understanding of the algorithms and preprocessing methods (and another point for your CV). You should be aware of the mathematics behind the most common ML algorithms, as a company will be more interested in your understanding rather than your ability to copy paste a code. A YouTube channel named Statquest will be quite helpful for this. You should also have a good grasp of linear algebra for everything to make sense.\n\nProbability and Statistics and puzzles is another important part of the process. For Probability and Statistics, one can refer to the lectures of the MA20205 course provided by the Mathematics department (Khare sir specifically) or the Stats110 playlist. For practice one can refer to the books \u201950 challenging problems in probability\u2019 and \u2018Heard on the street\u2019. You can practice puzzles on GFG puzzles or brainstellar.\n\nApart from all of these technical skills you should have good communication skills and confidence for your interview rounds.\n\n4 : What difficulties did you face while preparing for this Company/Profile? How did you overcome this problem\n\nDuring my CDC preparation I wanted to get an intern in a Data/ML role and didn\u2019t bother much about SDE. As a result, I didn\u2019t focus much on competitive programming and studied mostly ML, DL and mathematics. This foolishness cost me as I couldn\u2019t clear test rounds for some of the good data companies on day 1 and 2. To overcome this I simply practiced more and more CP even after the CDC process had started. So definitely learn from my mistake and do not ignore CP for this profile. The coding questions asked in the tests might not be as difficult as for a software company but you should have a good grasp on complete DSA.\n\n5 : According to you, who should ideally apply for this job?\n\nAnyone who is interested in Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Computer Vision or software and wants to work under a friendly environment should definitely apply here. Other than that, anyone who wants a chance to work in Japan should apply :)\n\n6 : Any specific advice you want to give to the junta sitting for internships this year\n\n7 : What are some of the major points you think would be valid to mention in your CV while targeting this profile? (any specific suggestions you would like to make?)\n\nHave multiple internships, projects, or competitions you have done in this field mentioned in your CV. These projects will help you steer the interview to your advantage. The interviewers also look at your technical skills so be sure to mention them. e.g., pytorch, keras, tensorflow, sklearn, etc.\n\nAll the best everyone. Machake!!"

I am about to intern at Honeywell in the summer of 2023. I offer my experience in this blog in the hope that it would be useful to someone going through the CDC process.\n\n2) How did you get into Honeywell? What was the selection procedure?\n\nApplying on ERP and CV preparation: The CDC process officially began in June end when we had to start preparing our CVs. This requires a lot of time and patience. Preparing a CV in a rush is not at all recommended. Reaching out to some seniors who sat for similar profiles and getting your CV verified by them is a must. I followed the same and incorporated their advice. Including necessary keywords in your resume, highlighting points of importance such as numbers, ranks and scores in your CV, etc are some of the points to be kept in mind.\n\nTests: Once the CV preparation window is closed, different companies start taking their tests. I primarily sat for the tests of companies which were offering SDE or Quant roles and sometimes, for analytics roles. The tests were all conducted online on different platforms like HireVue, HackerRank, Codility,etc. Since the process is hectic with multiple tests being conducted every day (even at strange hours), I would suggest to only apply and appear for those tests in which one is ardently interested. Although mostly the tests for SDE roles consist of 2\u20133 Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) questions to be solved in 1\u20131.5 hours, some tests also have MCQ questions from core CSE topics such as DBMS, OOPS and OS. Quant Tests include problems from probability, aptitude and puzzles as well. Keeping in mind the time constraint, a thorough practice of all these topics is suggested.\n\nThere are tests that have certain behavioral questions which are subjective in nature. Since they can be similar to what is often asked in interviews, it is a good practice to keep them ready well before the tests.\n\nAs far as the test for Honeywell is concerned, it was conducted on HackerRank, and it consisted of 3 DSA questions to be solved in 1 hour. While 1 question was from \u2018Graph\u2019, the remaining questions were of logic or sorting, mostly based on the CP pattern.\n\nInterviews: Once shortlisted, most of the companies take 2\u20133 rounds of interviews before final selection of the candidate. The first and foremost thing would be to prepare your introduction well; A mess-up on introduction would be the last thing one would want to do.\n\nThe next thing would be to prepare your CV well enough in depth, so that you are able to defend every possible question that the interviewer would ask. Once the introduction and CV discussion is over, the interviewer moves on to testing the coding skills. The coding questions are often based on topics like linked lists, trees, DP and graphs. Sometimes, they also include questions pertaining to searching and sorting algorithms. Practicing with mock interviews is a good way to go for overall preparation of the interview rounds.\n\nMy interview at Honeywell had 2 rounds, which were both conducted in online mode. The first was the technical round. The interviewer discussed my resume after a brief introduction of myself. I gave the interviewer an overview of all of my projects in a nutshell before being questioned in-depth about one of my development projects. Moving ahead, he asked me a few DSA questions, primarily about trees, including how to declare a tree data structure, how to traverse a tree, and the codes for the same. He continued by asking me for a puzzle. Towards the end of the interview, he asked questions about development concepts that mostly pertained to my projects. The second round which was the HR round was more of a behavioral question round. It included some of the most frequently asked questions \u201cWhy this company?\u201d and \u201cWhy interested in this role?\u201d among several others. Once he finished with the questions, he asked me if I had any queries. As I was ready for this, I asked him what changes I should make to myself and what advice he would want to give me. I also inquired about the projects I would be working on if I was chosen. After giving a thorough explanation, he concluded the interview. After around 30 minutes, I learned that I had been chosen.\n\n3) How to prepare for them?\n\nI had prior knowledge of C (which I learnt in the first-year course PDS) and C++ (which I continued after learning C). I had attempted some CodeChef contests and was acquainted with the contest environment. Once in my fourth semester, I began studying DSA topics, starting off with some fundamental mathematical ideas before progressively going on to data structures like linked lists, trees, and graphs. By the end of the fourth semester, my CGPA was 9.31. This gave me an edge in the shortlisting process as many companies prefer a high CGPA; Some even have a minimum CG criterion for appearing in the tests. My projects included two web-development (mainly front-end) projects, a Do-It-YourSelf course project and a Work-System-Design Lab project.\n\nMay mark the onset of the main preparation phase, during which I first devised a schedule and work plan for the topics to be covered. I practiced topic-specific questions on leetcode after going over the concepts for the topics I had not yet studied and after reviewing the ones I had previously gone through. The goal was to finish all of the topics by the end of July. For DSA concepts, I referred to a YouTube playlist and the DSA course by GFG. Depending on the amount of content, I intended to give each topic a specific length of time and made an effort to finish each one by the due date. I tried to practice 9 to 10 questions on Leetcode every day. However, it was a demanding task, and I occasionally faltered.\n\nContests on platforms like CodeChef, CodeForces, and others assist one become accustomed with the testing environment. This enables them to manage the time pressure and do well on the actual test. I participated in a relatively small number of contests. I\u2019d advise taking this seriously and upsolving the questions after the competitions. In addition to this, one must prepare for some fundamental CSE topics, such as OOPS, Operating systems, etc, which I did around the middle of July. GFG can be used as a resource for puzzles. There are a number of online publications, books as well as sites that one can use to practice probability and statistics, and aptitude problems.\n\n4) What difficulties did you face while preparing for this Company/Profile? How did you overcome this problem\n\nThe first and foremost issue was a lack of appropriate guidance. Since we spent our first four semesters in an online mode, it wasn\u2019t until our fourth semester that I learned about the apt requirements and reading materials needed for the CDC process. I faced the toughest obstacle in the form of consistency while preparing in the months of May-July. Setting unrealistic goals will cause one to stray from their plan of action, which I would strongly advise against. I sometimes strayed from my objective and had to make up the missed ground in the days that were left. In the end, you must push yourself to achieve the goal you have set. During the process, you might want to give up at certain times. Thus, being in a supportive environment where your parents, friends, seniors and loved ones provide you with constant encouragement is therefore essential.\n\n5) According to you, who should ideally apply for this job?\n\nA person who enjoys working with software, develops technologies that can be applied to a variety of jobs, and has a captivating enthusiasm for finding solutions to complex real-world challenges is just the right candidate for this job. On a broader perspective, the ideal candidate for this position is someone who is eager to progress both vertically and horizontally inside an organization, that is, to sustainably return to the organization by advancing its most recent technological or commercial advancements. Some of the attributes one must have to be fervently engaged in this job include developing and contributing to something that makes a significant difference in the world of technology and inspiring others to engage in engineering with a humanitarian attitude.\n\n6) Any specific advice you want to give to the junta sitting for internships this year.\n\nDuring the process, you might experience frustration and feel impatient quite a few times. It\u2019s possible that less deserving individuals receive offers prior to you. You can find yourself being shortlisted yet struggling in numerous interviews. It thus becomes imperative to stay in contact with seniors, friends and family who would provide you with constant support and motivation throughout this journey. Having said that, nothing can replace a sincere attempt. So, try to make the most of your preparation window. Failures are an inevitable aspect of life, and we have all faced them. What sets us apart from others is how we view failure. So even if the progress is gradual, we must strive to elevate ourselves every day. Prepare well, practice questions and give mock interviews. Best of luck to all.\n\n7) Kindly attach your resume. What are some of the major points you think would be valid to mention in your CV while targeting this profile? (any specific suggestions you would like to make?)\n\nIt is ideal to have a decent cg of 8 or greater. Highlight all of your accomplishments and contributions to the various events or competitions. Make advantage of statistics to highlight your accomplishments, such as rankings, scores, etc. A few development projects (web or app) would strengthen your resume. It might be beneficial to take courses offered by the mathematics and computer science departments."

I am from Hyderabad, Telangana.\n\n2 : How did you get into Nvidia? What was the selection procedure?\n\nThe first round was a written test that had 21 questions, and it had to be submitted in an hour. The first 7 questions were on Digital Electronics, focusing mainly on counters and flip-flops. The next 7 questions covered the basics of programming, and the last 7 questions were on aptitude.\n\nThe paper was logical and straightforward. Navigation was allowed in the exam, so you could choose which section to attempt first according to your strengths.\n\nThe second stage was an interview. Mine was the first interview. There were 3 interviewers and all of them were very friendly. It started with a general introduction, and they asked me about the topics I was comfortable with. The first interviewer asked 2 very basic questions on combinational logic and multiplexers. Then they asked me 2 questions about aptitude, one of which I already knew. The last question was a simple programming question for which I had to just give the logic. The whole interview was also filled with general talks about games and graphics. They also asked why I would like to join the company and how it would benefit me. The panel was very friendly and helpful wherever I got stuck.\n\n4 : How to prepare for them?\n\nStart with revising the basics of digital electronics taught in 2nd year. Questions on building gates using multiplexers and the basics of flip flops and counters were asked. Once confident with these, learning Static Time Analysis and the basics of Verilog would be helpful but not necessary. When asked, I clearly said that these were not covered in our course, and I did not have much idea about them; the panel moved to ask questions on the topics I knew and was comfortable with. The questions on programming can be solved from the topics taught in PDS in the first year. I found the lectures of Neso Academy to be helpful for quick revision before the interview and the exam.\n\n5 : What difficulties did you face while preparing for this Company/Profile? How did you overcome this problem?\n\nI did not face any difficulties during the procedure. I would advise you to stay cool and confident during the exam and not panic. The questions were logical and could be solved if you gave it a good thought. Also, I would suggest you to focus on the basics and be very clear with them before moving on to higher-level topics.\n\n6 : According to you, who should ideally apply for this job?\n\nAnyone who is very much interested in Digital Electronics and would love to know Digital design would enjoy the work. Also, anyone with good aptitude and who isn\u2019t sure about their profile can give it a shot, as it would not take much time to prepare.\n\n7 : Any specific advice you want to give to the junta sitting for internships this year?\n\nUnderstand that CDC can be very chaotic at times, and do not let it affect you. Stay in touch with your friends and take good care of them. Stay confident and hopeful throughout the process.\n\nDuring the interviews, make sure you voice your thoughts, as the interviewer will know the direction in which you are thinking and will help you if you are stuck. The procedure is more important than the final answer; hence, don\u2019t be silent. Let them know your hobbies and interests and how the specific company aligns with them. Keep learning throughout the process.\n\n8 : What are some of the major points you think would be valid to mention in your CV while targeting this profile?\n\nThey did not focus much on my CV until I pointed out a fact that was written in it. I did not have any previous internships or projects. I mentioned a few PORs that I had. You can mention some quick projects to be on the safe side, although it isn\u2019t mandatory. Good interaction and genuine interest in the company were more important than the CV."

        "content": "FORESIGHT(2023): Summer Internship at Jaguar Land Rover| Daksh Varshney|\n\n--\n\nListen\n\nHi! My name is Daksh Varshney. I am a third-year undergraduate student of the Department of Electronics and Electrical Communication Engineering. I was born and brought up in Noida, Uttar Pradesh. Last year, I received an internship offer in the Software Profile from Jaguar Land Rover via the CDC internship drive.\n\n2. How did you get into JLR? What was the selection procedure?\n\nThere were two rounds in the selection procedure: an online assessment and a technical interview.\n\nOnline Assessment: It consisted of two sections, one for coding and the other for aptitude questions. The coding section had 3 DSA questions based on DP, Graphs, and Strings. The questions were of moderate difficulty. The aptitude section consisted of questions based on probability and statistics, linear algebra, and other puzzle-based questions. Students from all the departments were allowed to take the coding test.\n\nTechnical Interview: The interview round was for about 1 hour. It started with some coding questions on topics like linked lists and graphs. All the questions were of moderate difficulty. After this, they started CV grilling in which they asked questions about my past internships and projects. They mainly focused on my contribution to these projects. Finally, some standard HR questions were asked.\n\n3. How to prepare for them?\n\nYou must be proficient in DSA. There are multiple resources for preparing it like Interviewbit, GeeksForGeeks, Leetcode, and CSES. Keep giving contests on platforms like Codeforces and Codechef to practice solving questions in a time-bound environment. Also, keep a good habit of calculating time complexity and space complexity while solving a problem.\n\nFor preparing the aptitude section, brush up on basic concepts of probability and statistics, and linear algebra, apart from this practice problems from Brainstellar and Heard on the Street book.\n\nFor the interview round, be ready to live code in front of the recruiter. So you need to be able to explain whatever you are coding. Also, be prepared for CV grilling. You should be familiar with the STAR (situation, task, action, and result) method to prepare for the behavioral questions.\n\n4. What difficulties did you face while preparing for this Company/Profile? How did you overcome this problem?\n\nThe major difficulty that I faced was not being able to properly explain the approach of my solution in the interview rounds. To overcome this, I took some help from seniors and friends and they took some mock interviews which eventually helped me to improve. I also used to watch technical interviews on YouTube which helped me a lot.\n\n5. According to you, who should ideally apply for this job?\n\nAnyone interested in Software roles should apply for this job. Anyone can apply because your department won\u2019t be a barrier.\n\n6. Any specific advice you want to give to the junta sitting for internships this year?\n\nThe entire procedure is highly demanding, so psychologically get ready for it and stay motivated. Make a group of friends that are targeting the same profile as you and prepare with them. Working together to prepare will keep you motivated and guarantee that you don\u2019t miss any crucial deadlines. Practice mock interviews with your friends or seniors.\n\nMake sure your CV is well-prepared and that your seniors have reviewed it. Never be afraid of asking your seniors for doubts. They will be more than happy to help you.\n\nFinally, acknowledge that rejection is a necessary component of the entire process. Therefore, keep working hard, trust the process, and never give up hope if you receive any rejections. Eventually, you will succeed. Best of Luck :)\n\n7. What are some of the major points you think would be valid to mention in your CV while targeting this profile? (any specific suggestions you would like to make?)\n\nIf you have any, try to highlight at least one project or internship, as these demonstrate that you have real-world experience and the ability to work with others to solve any challenge. You can mention your ranks in coding competitions (such as KickStart, Codejam, and HackerCup) and on websites like Codeforces and CodeChef in your resume. Above all, only include something on your resume that you can support or are sure of.\n\nAll the best junta!!"

I am a 3rd-year undergraduate student from the Department of Chemical Engineering, enrolled in its BTech course. I joined DRL as a summer intern this May.\n\nHello, I am Mayuri Sonowal, a final year student in the Department of Chemical Engineering. I did my summer internship at Dr. Reddy\u2019s Laboratories. Dr. Reddy\u2019s Laboratories is a leading multinational pharmaceutical corporation with operations in India and overseas. For the core profile, they mostly hire interns from the mechanical and chemical departments. So, I\u2019ve listed my experiences with the interview and shortlisting processes here.\n\n2. How did you get into Dr. Reddy\u2019s Laboratories? What was the selection procedure?\n\nCompilation:\n\nDr. Reddy offered internships for two profiles \u2013\n\n(i) Core (Technical Training at Manufacturing and R&D sites) \u2014 This role was open to students of Chemical and Mechanical Engineering.\n\n(ii) Analytics \u2014 This role was open to all departments including the Department of Chemical Engineering.\n\nThe selection procedure of the core profile consists of 4 rounds:\n\n\u00b7 First and foremost, there is a round of CV shortlisting. You have to submit your CV through the ERP. They did not specify CG criteria, although most people with a CG greater than 7 get shortlisted for the subsequent round.\n\n\u00b7 Online test (duration \u2014 1hr) \u2014 The test mainly had questions based on core Chemical Engineering (easy + average level questions), along with some psychometric and reasoning-based questions, and a few basic questions from chemistry. Almost 41 students qualified for the GD round (core profile).\n\n\u00b7 Group Discussion round \u2014 The GD round was the primary elimination round. It was technical in nature. Every group (7- 8 students) was given a different topic to discuss. The GD problems were mainly based on unit operations (distillation, drying, etc.) and concepts of fluid mechanics. 17 students qualified for the interview round (core profile).\n\n\u00b7 Interview \u2014 It was only one round of interview for approximately 25 minutes. In the interview, I was asked about the projects mentioned in my CV. Also, I was asked situation-based questions on distillation and reactors and I tried to answer them using basic chemical engineering concepts.\n\nIn approximately the last 5 minutes of the interview, I was asked some basic HR questions like \u2018Why DRL\u2019, \u2019my extra academic engagements\u2019, and \u2018hobbies\u2019.\n\nFinally, 7 students were selected for the core profile and 2 for the analytics profile.\n\n3. How to prepare for them?\n\nCompilation:\n\nOne has to be thorough with the concepts of their core discipline. For chemical engineering students, fluid mechanics, HT, MT, concepts of humidity and basics of reactors, as well as the fundamentals of thermodynamics are important topics.\n\nFor the test round, I personally felt that solving core chemical engineering questions and aptitude questions will be good enough to get through it.\n\nFor the GD round, knowledge of unit operations and other basic concepts was required. This round is one of the biggest hurdles in the entire selection procedure as more than 50% of students are eliminated at this round. But, thinking about the problem statement in terms of whatever basic concepts you have studied can be really helpful.\n\nFor the interview, one should be able to explain each and everything mentioned in the CV. One should be clear with all aspects of the projects/internships they have done. Aside from that, if you have certain projects, you will always have an edge.\n\n4. What difficulties did you face while preparing for this Company/Profile? How did you overcome this problem?\n\nCompilation:\n\nStaying positive throughout the process is really necessary and very difficult as well. As the number of companies pursuing core profiles is limited, people who are genuinely interested in the core have fewer opportunities. I tried to be in touch with friends and have some fun time to avoid getting stressed.\n\nHowever, if you\u2019re going for several profiles, then effective time distribution has to be done. I would suggest to prepare an approximate daily routine and follow that. Aside from that, if Dr. Reddy\u2019s or another core organization is your main goal, design your CV in a strategy that represents your passion and become well acquainted with your theories.\n\nSo, if you truly want to create a good impression, attempt to understand all of the chemical or mechanical engineering concepts and construct your resume in such a manner that you\u2019re confident in everything you\u2019ve said.\n\n5. According to you who should ideally apply for this job?\n\nCompilation:\n\nAnyone who is interested in core and wants to understand or evaluate the practical implication of their core domain knowledge or wants to know how the pharma industry works can apply for this profile. Students interested in coding and machine learning can also apply for analytics profiles.\n\nAside from that, I feel that everyone with even a slight amount of curiosity should apply because the experience would be unique and you could get motivated after working there.\n\n6. Any specific advice you want to give the junta, sitting for internships this year.\n\nCompilation:\n\nI have a few pieces of advice for students who will be sitting for the internship this year-\n\nBe patient throughout the internship period. Keep in mind that the CDC is not your only choice. The two-month internship is an opportunity to evaluate yourself, therefore it\u2019s okay if you don\u2019t get an internship within the first three days.\n\nAs DRL comes after day 3, I would strongly suggest, don\u2019t panic seeing other people getting internships on Day 1 and Day 2. Don\u2019t overthink about the results, and give your best shot. Believe in yourself!!\n\n7. What are some of the major points you think would be valid to mention in your CV while targeting this profile? (any specific suggestion you would like to make?)\n\nCompilation:\n\nThe main components are your projects, as well as what you\u2019ve learned and assessed from them. If you have done any internships or projects, you can add them to your CV. It will help in your interviews as you will have something to speak about and it will showcase your knowledge. You can also have a look at your seniors\u2019 CVs, to get an idea of how to present things.\n\nRemember to add any extracurricular activities in which you have participated. Try to demonstrate that you are a versatile applicant who has participated in a variety of activities. As a result, it is critical that you correctly identify all Projects, PORs, and EAAs in which you have participated."

Also, students with good PORs and leadership experience targeting managerial roles in the future can apply for this profile.\n\n6) Any specific advice you want to give to the junta sitting for internships this year?\n\nThe primary focus should be on acing your coding tests. Preparations for them would be similar for the majority of the companies, so that needs to be settled first. Then you can move on to preparing for interviews and further selection processes of the companies you wish to target.\n\n7) What are some of the major points you think would be valid to mention in your CV while targeting this profile? (any specific suggestions you would like to make?)\n\nIn the first place, describe all your projects and previous internships thoroughly in your CV. That will have a substantial impact throughout the process.\n\nNext, for some situation-based questions, like \u2014 Tell me about a time when you handled a disagreement as a team, tell me about a time you failed and what learnings you got from it, etc., having suitable PORs and EAAs where you dealt with such situations would really help.\n\nLastly, fill the entire page for your CV. Try to find anything that seems valuable enough to be added to it. Filling it with the least significant points will still be more cordial than leaving empty spaces at the bottom."

I just completed my 4th year in the Electrical Engineering department\u2019s dual degree course. I am a boarder of Azad hall of residence. Appreciate the initiative by SWG to share the experiences of people spread across various fields, helping our beloved KGP community.\n\nI\u2019m Ajay. I am currently in my final year. I am pursuing a Dual Degree course from Agriculture Department.\n\nHello everyone! I\u2019m Ankit Kumar Sahoo, a third-year B. Tech student from the Department of Industrial & Systems Engineering.\n\nHi everyone, I am Anurat Bhattacharya, a third-year undergraduate student enrolled in the 4-year BTech course in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering.\n\nHello everyone, I\u2019m Mayukh Raychaudhuri, a third-year B.Tech. undergraduate from the Department of Metallurgical & Materials Engineering, IIT Kharagpur. I\u2019m also enrolled for a micro specialization in Artificial Intelligence and Applications.\n\nMy name is Nikunj Kumar Madhogaria. I am a 3rd-year undergraduate student at IIT Kharagpur. I am from the Industrial and Systems Engineering department, enrolled in its B. Tech. course.\n\nHola! I am Samar Pratap Singh, a third-year undergraduate from the Department of Electrical Engineering.\n\nWe all got an offer at Sprinklr as Product Engineer Interns\n\nHow did you all get into Sprinklr? What was the selection procedure?\n\nSprinklr offers the role of Product Engineering interns on our campus. It is similar to SDE. The role is open to students across all departments and there is no cutoff for CGPA. The selection procedure consists of broadly two stages: a coding round and some interview rounds. There are two or three interview rounds and one HR round scheduled for the shortlisted students.\n\nHow to prepare for them?\n\nYou can broadly divide your preparation into three parts: Projects/Internships, DSA and CS Core Concepts.\n\nProjects get highlighted in your CV and showcase your industry knowledge. You can prepare 3\u20134 projects beforehand so that you do not need to worry about them at the end moment. A good project might showcase a good grasp of the fundamental concepts. The projects highlighted in your CV should be diverse, i.e., if one project is about Web Dev, the other one can be a C++ app highlighting a particular algorithm\u2019s use case.\n\nIf you are a dual degree student, you can do summer research internships in the 2nd and 3rd years, allowing you to have some projects and internships to show on your resume.\n\nThere are too many topics to cover and too many concepts to get a good grasp on the field of Software Development. Most companies, however, test your basic concepts related to algorithms, data structures, and OOP, allowing them to get an idea of how fast you will be capable of learning something new. If you are proficient in Data Structures, Algorithms, and Math, you can master any new topic in days in this constantly evolving world of software. Hence, it is recommended to sharpen your algorithm skills as much as possible over learning topics with no deep knowledge.\n\nThe DSA part is something that requires much time and attention. The best way to prepare is to solve problems as much as possible. You can study DSA by referring to different sites such as GFG, Tutorialspoint, etc. If less time is left for CDC, you can take a course on AlgoZenith which can help you in preparing for DSA.\n\nSolving standard problems helps a lot. While companies ask for new problems, most problems in their problem set are standard ones. Hence, it is suggested not to leave them. Solve as many standard problems as you can. Standard problems can easily be found on leetcode, interview bit, and similar platforms. Nowadays, we also have many sheets of standard questions available free on the internet, and solving them would also be useful. Try to become acquainted with all of the classic problems from greedy, dynamic programming (DP), and graphs. Don\u2019t go towards solving competitive-type problems from sites like Codeforces and CodeChef before you are well versed with the common problems. And even if you prefer these competitive sites, there are sections for DSA learning there that should be preferred over problems from contests.\n\nYou can give contests regularly on Codeforces, Google Challenges, and CodeChef for speed, fast and accurate implementation and can do Interviewbit, CSES, and Leetcode for different types of problems. binarysearch.com is also a platform where you can do problems. It has an amazing room feature where you can compete with your friends in a time restraint. During this time you can also participate in Google Kickstart which will help you in getting good practice and identifying topics that have been missed.\n\nFor 2 months, focus primarily on DSA. You can solve questions from Codeforces(1600\u20132000 rated) by filtering various topics. 1 month before CDC you can start doing OOPs, OS, Network, ML/DL, basic probability and statistics, and puzzles. For puzzles, the best sources are the book \u2018Heard on the Street and the website \u2018Brainstellar\u2019. For probability and statistics, any resource which can teach you the required concepts will do. Do not just understand the theory, solve some problems to make sure you have understood the concepts. Whichever domain you apply to, you should not only read things but try writing/coding them yourself. By only reading, you might think that you have memorized and understood, but in the long run, things might fade out.\n\nIt is often asked how much time we should give to a question if we are unable to solve it. It mostly depends on you, but in the beginning, try providing enough time (at least 15/20 mins) so that you feel whatever I have learned I have given a thought on it and by seeing the answer you should not feel that I could have done that if I had been given more time.\n\nCS Core concepts like DBMS, Compilers, OS, Networks, etc., are also recommended if you are aiming for Day 1 or Day 2 companies. If you have a rough idea about them you can keep these for the end and prepare them in the last two weeks before the interviews. You can just read short notes from GFG if that is sufficient for you.\n\nWhat difficulties did you all face while preparing for this Company/Profile? How did you overcome this problem?\n\nWho should ideally apply for this profile?\n\nThis profile is recommended for anyone who is:\n\nThe SDE profile in Sprinklr has four roles: Front-end, Back-end, Machine Learning (ML) and Data Science. Mention the role of preference in your resume.\n\nWhat are some of the major points you think would be valid to mention in your CV while targeting this profile? (any specific suggestions you would like to make?)\n\nThe target is to make your CV distinctive, which allows you to stand out. Showcase your strengths in the CV. Any skill which is relevant to the profile can be considered a skill as long as you can back it up. Mentioning courses taken in Computer Science core might favour you as well. Showcase your competitive programming ranks, if any. Since the interviewers judge you on your problem-solving skills, your ranks will be a good testament to your ability. Global ranks in competitions like Google Code Jam, Google Kick Start, and Facebook Hacker Cup can also boost your chances.\n\nProjects and internships indicate hands-on experience, which interviewers generally take on a good note. Projects can be anything from self-projects or course projects. While more projects are always appreciated, unique projects allow the spotlight to fall on you. Any experience in ML/Artificial Intelligence, Data Science, Database and Networking systems, usage of git, etc. can increase the interviewer\u2019s preference of you over your peers.\n\nWhile making a CV, fill full pages rather than half pages. More importantly, be honest in what you represent in your CV. Be ready to be grilled upon anything you write on the CV.\n\nAny specific advice you want to give to the junta sitting for internships this year.\n\nThe journey will be challenging, fun, and sometimes stressful and hectic. As the competition and content increase yearly, it is advised not to target all profiles blindly. Rather, it is optimal to target one or two profiles and keep your preparation strong for those. Start preparing a bit early on. Create some good projects which are worth looking at.\n\nIn the last month, try not to waste your time and strengthen your basics. Since pre-final year students are not expected to know much, you will be evaluated on problem-solving skills. Try improving it as much as possible. OOP basics are important, as typical Algo/DS concepts can\u2019t be understood without completing a good project. Get used to sitting for long hours and brainstorming over a problem. Solve enough problems such that your codes are accepted in the first go. Give competitions from multiple sources like CodeChef, CodeForces, AtCoder, etc. It will provide you with different types of questions to learn from.\n\nThere are different coding problem patterns from different companies. Learn at least 2 languages (preferably C++ and Python). Try mock tests in HackerEarth and Hackerrank, since they are most companies\u2019 go-to sites when it comes to their tests. Be confident and try to do it in one go as wrong answers will make you panic. Attempt all questions, since partial marking is provided based on the number of test cases satisfied. Write clean and readable codes. Use meaningful variable names.\n\nPre-interview nervousness is normal. Check some interview behaviours, quizzes, puzzles, etc. During your interviews, try to focus and answer as you do during your preparation. Be sure to ask the interviewer some doubts if you are unclear on something. Use the brute force approach when you are not sure about the optimal approach. If you are sure about both of them, ask the interviewer for their preference of approach and proceed with it. Be confident and answer it in-depth, explaining all the paths taken and the infeasible paths.\n\nInterviews can be tiring. Believe in yourself and try your best. Forget previously messed-up interviews and focus on the current one. Your grade, department, and luck can influence this process. Finally, remember that even if you don\u2019t get in, it\u2019s just an 8-week period (internship). It won\u2019t impact your career heavily."

I am a Final-year Dual degree student from the Computer Science and Engineering department. I am interning this summer at Intuit as a Software Development Intern.\n\n2) How did you get into Intuit? What was the selection procedure?\n\nThere were two coding rounds followed by 2 Interviews. The first coding round consists of 4 coding questions in the easy-medium range and everyone was allowed to take the test. As per my knowledge whoever solved all the coding questions in 40\u201350 minutes was allowed to take the second coding test. Also, a number of the wrong submissions were considered ( as claimed by some batchmates ). The second coding round consists of 2 medium-hard coding questions, a duration of 1 hour. One was on Prefix Array and one on Greedy with queries. Interviews varied from student to student, mine were predominantly based on medium DSA questions along with computer science fundamentals and HR questions in each round.\n\n3) How to prepare for them?\n\nI started CP in my fourth semester by giving Codeforces contests. My growth was normal till Nov 20. After that, I took Algozenith course which affected my learning curve in an amazing way. Till Feb 21 I dedicated myself to doing Algozenith materials, after that I started practicing from leetcode. Solving mostly Medium-Hard questions I would suggest. I used to give virtual leetcode contests as much as I can (daily 1 or 2). I also used to give contests from binarysearch \u2014 a similar platform like leetcode. Also in binarysearch I used to practice with my peers, a good way to compete as well as exchange ideas. As the preparation phase came to an end, I started giving mock interviews with my peers ( leetcode has a feature, you can try ).\n\n15 days before my coding rounds started I started Interviewbit and completed almost >90% of the questions. Simultaneously I was preparing for CS Fundamentals from my course slides and GateSmashers.\n\n4) What difficulties did you face while preparing for this Company/Profile? How did you overcome this problem?\n\nInitially, I was not confident with DP and Graphs. So, the standard way to make something comfortable is to solve a lot of problems. For graphs I used CSES and for DP I mostly solved > 80% of questions from Algozenith followed by solving > 50 DP problems from leetcode.\n\n5) According to you, who should ideally apply for this job?\n\nDevelopers in Intuit are really amazing and get exposure to awesome things. People who love to solve real-life problems through code and want to make an impact in the lives of other people and aspire for the best work-life balance should definitely go for Intuit.\n\n6) What are some of the major points you think would be valid to mention in your CV while targeting this profile? (any specific suggestions you would like to make?)\n\n7) Any specific advice you want to give to the junta sitting for internships this year.\n\nThe preparation phase will keep on becoming stressful as tests will start approaching. I would suggest keeping your connection with peers who are going through the same phase would definitely help you to overcome this.\n\nAlso, during the interview think aloud while solving. Interviewers like to see what is going on in your mind. While coding, maintain good coding practices like camelCase notation, giving proper variable names, spacing, etc.\n\nWishing you all the best for your upcoming internship drive."

        "content": "FORESIGHT(2022): Summer Internship at Oracle | Compilation\n\n--\n\nListen\n\n1) Introduction\n\nHello everyone!\n\nI am Shourya Sharma, a final year undergraduate student from the Department of Mechanical Engineering enrolled in its B.Tech course.\n\nHello, My Name is Nikhil Yadav. I am a Final year Undergraduate student in the Department of Mathematics at IIT Kharagpur, enrolled in its 5-year Integrated M.Sc course. I am currently living in Jodhpur, Rajasthan. I love playing badminton, reading philosophy novels, and watching sci-fi movies.\n\nMy name is Vamshidhar Reddy Dudyala. I am a final year undergraduate student from the CSE department enrolled in its DD course.\n\nWe all got an internship offer at Oracle as SDE interns.\n\n2) How did you all get into Oracle? What was the selection procedure?\n\nThe selection procedure was of 2 steps, as usual, a test and then interviews. Oracle came for 2 profiles Applications Developer and Server Technology and conducted a test to shortlist candidates.\n\nThe test had 4 parts.\n\n1. English \u2014 basic.\n\n2. Core CS subjects \u2014 OOPs, DBMS, OS, etc.\n\n3. DSA \u2014 AVL, RB tree, Radix sort, etc. {unconventional}\n\n4. Aptitude \u2014 standard.\n\nEach section had its time slot so you can\u2019t repurpose the time you save in 1&4 to 2&3. There were a lot of questions and you can\u2019t go back, so you have to judge if the current question is worth solving or not.\n\nThe second one was a typical coding interview. They asked for basic BST, Linked list, and a few other standard problems. After which they asked if I knew anything about OOPs, DBMS, Java, etc. To all of which I answered NO. The interviewers were nice and didn\u2019t press on. Instead, they started asking me for interesting logical puzzles.\n\nThen they conducted interviews for the shortlisted people which were of 2\u20133 rounds. Questions about prior internships and projects were also discussed.\n\n3) How to prepare for them?\n\nThe preparation is just like all other Software profile companies. Firstly, one has to be clear with all the concepts of Data Structures and Algorithms to get into a software developer role. The best platform to start DSA is Interviewbit. After solving Interviewbit fully, start practicing in Leetcode, write weekly contests, and take as many mock contests as possible because writing the whole code and debugging under a time limit is very important and Leetcode provides a platform for Mock Contests. Having a group of friends with whom you can practice coding like we used to start a mock contest with only hard questions if any of us solved the questions everyone else would be able to see it in between the contests, so it became very competitive. Once you get a good hold on the concepts of DSA and solve many questions you can move to Codeforces or Codechef and start solving questions from there. Apart from standard DSA prep, if you have spare time, try to learn OOPs and the basics of Java. Their test had questions on various fields like Core CS topics, Language, some Coding questions, and Aptitude test. If you want to learn core CS topics, you can try out the channels on Youtube.\n\nOverall the test was not very Competitive coding oriented like other Software companies instead was focused more on overall knowledge of CS and aptitude.\n\n4) Difficulties faced while preparing for the Company/Profile and how to overcome them.\n\nOne of the major problems in getting into a software developer role is competition. Even after solving all the questions, one might not get shortlisted. To overcome this problem, one has to give as many mock tests as possible so that one gets used to writing code within the timeframe. Having a good CGPA and a good resume with decent projects is always an added advantage in getting shortlisted but not necessary. Having great coding skills is the most important factor to get into the Software Developer role.\n\n5) Who should apply for this internship?\n\nIf you like solving logical problems, doing coding in general, or are interested in Software Development, then you can be a good fit for this profile. Also, there is job stability in this field compared to HFTs (High-Frequency Trading), so if you prefer this, then go for it.\n\n6) What are some of the major points you think would be valid to mention in your CV while targeting this profile? (any specific suggestions you would like to make?)\n\nFor software profiles in general, previous internships and projects and technical skills matter. This gives you an edge over other people as the interviewer gets something to talk about and you have an opportunity to make an impression. Adding ratings on different Programming websites and ranks in competitions like Kickstart and Codejam allow you to stand out. Positions of Responsibility (PORs) are not that important but look good if you have them.\n\nDo not write anything on your resume that you are not confident about. If you are mentioning any project/intern make sure you are very thorough with it. Even if you exaggerate anything, just make sure that you can defend it.\n\n7) Any specific advice you all want to give to the junta sitting for internships this year.\n\nPrepare for tests at least 3\u20134 months early and keep in touch with your friends to be on track. Solve standard questions from Leetcode and GFG. Go through previously asked questions of various companies. Try giving mock interviews in parallel, so that it gives you confidence and an edge over other folks. Keep your introduction ready and better if you learn it by heart. Also, talk to seniors about the hiring process of specific companies you are targeting. Try to learn about the latest products or launches by the company you are applying for.\n\nOn the interview day, remain calm and keep yourself hydrated throughout the day as it will be hectic. Your mental toughness counts more than your technical skills during CDC season. Handling rejections is an acquired skill. Bounce back fast."

        "content": "FORESIGHT(2022): Summer Internship at Google| Compilation\n\n--\n\nListen\n\n1)Brief Introduction\n\nHey, I am Balakrushna Dash, a pre-final undergraduate student of IIT KGP, pursuing my B-tech course in the department of ECE.\n\nHi, I am Sumit Kumar Yadav, a final year undergraduate student from the Department of Computer Science and Engineering enrolled in its integrated dual degree course.I got Internship offers from Google and Microsoft through the on-campus CDC drive last year(2021).\n\nWe are interning this summer at Google as Software Engineers.\n\n2) How did you get into Google? What was the selection procedure?\n\nThe selection process involved one coding round followed by 2 technical interview rounds.The coding test was conducted on the HackerEarth platform in which 2 questions were given to solve in 60 mins.\n\nIn a particular case, the 1st problem was based on DP+DSU and the other problem was on DP.\n\nInterview Round 1: (50 min) The interview started with an introduction. After this, the interviewer asked the interviewee for 1 grid problem in which he had to find the longest path considering some additional constraints. He started with a brute force solution and worked on improving it while discussing it with the interviewer and came up with a solution using greedy and DP with optimization. He explained his logic and then, jumped to implementation.\n\nAfter this, the interviewer told him to trace this longest path. At last, the interviewer asked how his algorithm changes if some values are repeated in the grid. He explained his logic, and the interviewer was happy with it.\n\nRound 2: (45 min) The interview started with an introduction. After this, the interviewer asked him about 1 coding problem related to calculating the Jaccard similarity. He explained his logic and implemented it using map STL and then he was asked to improve complexity using some mathematics, to which he came up with the solution and coded it also. At last,He was asked one follow-up question, which he solved using a binary search.\n\nBoth the interviewers were quite friendly and helpful.\n\n3) How to prepare for them?A thorough understanding of algorithms and data structures is required for software engineering-based profiles. Once the basics of DSA are clear, there are many sources to practice problem-solving. If you are a beginner, then refer to Leetcode and InterviewBit. Once you feel confident in standard DSA, you can participate in competitive programming contests on codeforces to boost your problem-solving ability.Apart from standard DSA prep, if you have extra time, try to learn OOPs and core CS Subjects, mainly Operating systems and Computer Networks.\n\nFor Google, much importance is given to the candidate\u2019s resume, especially past Kickstart/Codejam performances. So, make sure to participate in these contests.Also, they asked a lot of DP problems for that practice problem from the Leetcode hard DP section.\n\nFrom someone who had successfully qualified it, this was his journey of preparation:\n\nHe started his competitive programming at the end of his 4th semester by giving contests on codeforces. He regularly gave contests and practice problems on different topics for around 6 months on codeforces. This builds the base, then he started to practice problems topic-wise to take this to another level.\n\nFor the graph, he solved the problems given in the CSES problem set.\n\nFor the DP, he solved problems given in the Leetcode (medium+hard).Just one month before the coding round started, he started Interviewbit and solved most of the questions.\n\n4) What difficulties did you face while preparing for this Company/Profile? How did you overcome this problem?In the beginning, I only used to solve problems from codeforces, but around 2 months before the start of the internship coding test, I didn\u2019t feel very confident in the dynamic programming-related problems. So, to overcome this, I moved to leetcode and after solving around 50\u201360 DP hard problems, I gained confidence which ultimately helped me in the test and interviews.\n\n5) According to you, who should ideally apply for this job?People interested in Algorithms and Data Structure and who want to pursue a career in software development can apply. There is a lot of scope for learning new technologies and skills during the internship.\n\n6) What are some of the major points you think would be valid to mention in your CV while targeting this profile? (any specific suggestions you would like to make?)\n\nFocus on competitive programming( or solving questions from leetcode) instead of doing random projects just to write in your CV.\n\nOne project is sufficient, and if you are a CS student, you will be doing one project in a software engineering course in your 4th semester.\n\nSo, try to participate in as many programming contests(Kickstart, Codejam, ICPC, Codeforces, Codechef) as you can and write those ranks/ratings that will be really useful during shortlisting.\n\nIt\u2019s totally fine, if you are in your second year and you don\u2019t have enough points to write, in that case, you can write your school achievements.\n\nProject-under-Prof is not compulsory, you can add self-projects to your CV as well. Just remember one thing, whatever skills you are going to add to your CV, you are expected to be knowledgeable about them. Any tech-related work in any society or any kind of achievement in some hackathon/contest will have a positive impact.\n\nSelf-project ideas: just google search for some python project and pick whatever you feel can complete.\n\n7) Any specific advice you want to give to the junta sitting for internships this year.\n\nFor preparation:-Practice CP.Try to learn the basics of OOPs.Dev-related projects may help.POR(s) are not at all necessary.\n\nFor Interview:-The best advice would be to stay confident and believe in yourself.The interviewer mainly wants to judge how well you think and approach a problem.It is very important that while thinking about the problem\u2019s solution, you think out loud.Keep talking with the interviewer about your approach so that even if you go wrong, he can give you a hint to get you back on track."

What was the selection procedure?\n\nI got into AlphaGrep via the CDC Internship Program. IIT Kharagpur\u2019s placement cell (known as the CDC) organised the on-campus hiring for various companies.\n\nAlphaGrep had an online test consisting of two sections, coding and MCQ.\n\nThe coding section had three relatively easy questions and could be done easily in time.\n\nThe concepts required were simulation/implementation, binary indexed trees and greedy.\n\nThe MCQ section had 45 questions to answer in thirty minutes. Almost all the questions were based on C++ fundamentals, with some sprinkling of Object Oriented System Design based questions. Considering the evident time crunch, this was something one had to focus for to do well in.\n\nAlphaGrep shortlisted 8 students for its SDE profile. From what I observed, they seemed to be high CGPA students from the CS/MA departments.\n\nHow to prepare for them?\n\nTo get shortlisted, I recommend having a moderate grip over Data Structures and Algorithms (Codeforces 1600+ rating) combined with a sound knowledge of the C++ language.\n\nAlphaGrep\u2019s code base is primarily in C++ and hence they need employees who understand the language well.\n\nUnfortunately, at least for the internship drive, it seems that AlphaGrep prefers relatively higher CG students from MA/CS.\n\nTo crack the interview, I\u2019d recommend learning C++ class design. Having a good grip of Object Oriented Class Design in C++ along with a thorough understanding of C++\u2019s fundamentals should be enough to get you through. Knowledge of Operating Systems theory will be icing on the cake.\n\nWhat difficulties did you face while preparing for this Company/Profile?

There were 15 MCQs on topics spanning across networking, core computer topics like OS and all.\n\nThe 1st interview round was supposed to be 45 mins but in my case it got stretched to over 1 hour because of repeated connectivity issues. This interview consisted mostly of medium easy level DSA questions from topics like binary search and a very standard DP question. Also got asked a lot of questions on OS, computer networks, dbms etc.\n\nThe 2nd round lasted only 20 mins or so and It was a project discussion round. The interviewer asked me to describe one of my projects from start to finish and how it can be optimized, how it might be scaled and all.\n\nThe 3rd round has a HR round. It consisted of questions like where do I see myself 5 years down the line, name some Cisco products, why do u want to join Cisco. The round ended with a discussion about the stipend and my preference for work location.\n\nHow to prepare for them?\n\nBe thorough with all your DSA problem solving skills. Interview bit and Leetcode are possibly the best resources out there to prepare for coding rounds. Apart from coding it is essential to have an understanding of the core CS topics like DBMS, OS and networking(Cisco focuses on networking a lot, I don\u2019t think other companies focus a lot on this). This helped me to score some additional brownie points.Also I participated in CF and Atcoder contests regularly which certainly developed my problem solving skills, but I didn\u2019t focus a lot on those contests.\n\nWhat difficulties did you face while preparing for this Company/Profile? How did you overcome this problem?\n\nThe difficulty with preparing for a profile like SDE is not actually the lack of resources but it\u2019s quite the opposite, There are too many resources to make a beginner puzzled as to where to even start. The best solution will be to focus on just one particular resource and trust it blindly and unless you are able to solve a good chunk of the single resource you started with don\u2019t look to anything else as it will confuse you more. That\u2019s the strategy I followed and personally I would recommend leetcode and later on for revising, solve InterviewBit.\n\nAccording to you, who should ideally apply for this job?\n\nAnyone having good problem solving skills and the ability to grasp things quickly, as things change really fast in the software field and one would need to adapt and be flexible enough to adapt to these changes.\n\nWhat are some of the major points you think would be valid to mention in your CV while targeting this profile? (Any specific suggestions you would like to make?)\n\nHave good projects on our CV. Don\u2019t just keep hoping to get a project from a professor or some other place, just start working on some self projects if you are not getting positive replies.(Fun Fact :- All the projects on my CV were self projects) Don\u2019t just keep hoping to get a project from a professor or some other place, just start working on some self projects if you are not getting positive replies.\n\nAny specific advice you want to give to the junta sitting for internships this year.\n\nAlong with focusing on DSA , do put a heavy emphasis on core CS concepts. These are the topics almost nobody does and hence if you are prepared with these it will give you an advantage over others. DSA questions which get asked in interviews and tests are not crazy tough, the time one spends on solving tough questions on CP platforms could be used to study these topics."

        "content": "FORESIGHT(2022): Summer Internship at Microsoft | Compilation\n\n--\n\nListen\n\n1) Introduction\n\nHello everyone!\n\nI am Prabhu, a fourth-year undergraduate student at IIT Kharagpur pursuing Mathematics and Computing (5 yr. Integ MSc). I am a boarder at LBS hall in KGP and am from Chennai, Tamil Nadu.\n\nMy name is Aryaman Jain. I am a fourth-year undergraduate from the Department of Computer Science and Engineering. I am currently interning at Microsoft as an SDE.\n\nMy name is Sunanda Mandal. As of 2021 during the CDC internship drive, I completed my second year of B. Tech in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering.\n\nWe all got an internship offer at Microsoft as SDE interns.\n\n2) How did you all get into Microsoft? What was the selection procedure?\n\nMicrosoft was open to all students with a CG greater than 7.5 and no active backlogs. Microsoft\u2019s Screening Test was different from those of other companies. The test was conducted on Codility, which doesn\u2019t require turning on the camera. Only two questions were asked, and both of them were very easy. However, unlike other tests, we only see the results of sample test cases during the test. Around 45 students were shortlisted based on Submission time and System tests.\n\nThere were 3 rounds of interviews (2 technical and 1 Hr.).\n\nRound 1:\n\nThe first question of the round was a CP question immediately after the introduction. In total, two questions were asked in this round, one of them was a Leetcode Hard level question. After round 1, I was called for round 2 within five minutes\n\nRound 2:\n\nThis is, as far as I know, the round that determines your selection. This interview round lasted more than 1 hour and included questions about DSA, OOPS, OS and System design.\n\nRound 3:(Hr. round)\n\nI was asked about my plans after completing college. As I\u2019m from MnC, the interviewer was interested in the CS courses we study and questions were asked from the same. This round also consisted of a couple of CP(DSA) questions (again here is one direct Leetcode Hard problem)\n\nI was asked about my motivation behind choosing ML over my core subjects, my favorite mechanical engineering subject and the reason behind it.\n\nPS, the interview round was quite different for different candidates and it will highly depend on your CV. If your CV is not much aligned to ML, you can also expect questions from algorithms and data structures or software-related projects/courses if you have mentioned any in your CV.\n\n3) How to prepare for them?\n\nProjects that are mentioned in the CV should be prepared thoroughly. Do not write anything in the CV that you are not aware of.\n\nmaintaining a good CG and having a couple of software-related projects (self or supervised) are good to have\n\nSince you get to know the selection results a week before, I would advise the candidates to go through Microsoft careers page\u2019s tips and tricks to prepare accordingly.\n\nFor Online Assessment it was easy coding questions so anyone who solved a decent amount of questions were able to do it.\n\nFor Interviews, Practicing leetcode questions from every DSA topic will be enough. Pick Leetcode Hard Problems by randomizing (Pick one option in LC) the questions. This helped to cover a wide range of topics in less time and boosted the confidence as well.\n\nFor algorithms and data structures gave regular contests on codeforces and atcoder. For interviews and famous problems use interview bit and cses.fi.\n\nTo understand complex concepts in DSA, follow this.\n\nAnd before appearing for an interview in any Company/profile try to learn what they do and why you want to apply.\n\n4) Difficulties faced while preparing for the Company/Profile and how to overcome them The major difficulties faced are having low confidence even with good experience with interviews, feeling demotivated whenever they do not give their best and not being able to explain their own code because of nervousness. Practicing mock interviews regularly is the best way to solve this. Contacting the people who are preparing for the same position/ similar interview and discussing the problems that aren\u2019t solvable by ourselves will help overcome this.\n\n5) Who should apply for this internship?\n\nAnyone who is interested in Software profiles and has a good hold of DSA can apply. If you like to learn and work on the latest technologies and are interested in Software Development, you will like the work. They do not generally ask development related questions in the interviews. If\n\nIf you are comfortable with solving coding problems and have knowledge of core CS concepts you should definitely apply for this job.\n\n6) What are some of the major points you think would be valid to mention in your CV while targeting this profile? (any specific suggestions you would like to make?)\n\nFor Software Intern role software development projects are more valuable than ML projects. Nicely highlight all your achievements in the Academic Achievements sections. Put your handle ratings from websites like codeforces and codechef. Mention the rank if you\n\nparticipated in google codejam, Kickstart or Facebook hackercup. Put open source contributions if any.\n\nFinally do not focus on the number games of Day 1,2 etc.\n\n7) Any specific advice you all want to give to the junta sitting for internships this year."

I\u2019m pursuing a B.Tech. in Electronics and Electrical Communication Engineering and a minor in Computer Science and Engineering. During the CDC internship recruitment drive, I received an offer from Salesforce for their SWE intern role.\n\nI was shortlisted for 3 companies on day 1 (Tower Research, GS, Sprinklr) wherein I couldn\u2019t grab an offer after several rounds in these companies. On day 2, I was shortlisted for 4 companies, namely, Salesforce, Oracle, TI Embedded Software, and Honeywell. Salesforce was the first company I was interviewed for on the day and I received an offer from them soon after.\n\nHow did you get into Salesforce? What was the selection procedure?\n\nSalesforce is open to CS, EE, EC, IM, MA branches\n\nOnline Coding Test \u2014 1\n\n3 questions\n\n1st \u2014 Easy \u2014 Question based on STL implementation\n\n2nd \u2014 Medium \u2014 Min. time to get all jobs done under some constraints (Binary search)\n\n3rd \u2014 Medium \u2014 Question on graph (DFS)\n\nInterview rounds \u2014 2\n\nFirst-round (Technical) \u2014 Few medium to hard level coding questions (similar to that in Leetcode), Discussion on some specific concepts of OOPs, and Puzzles (might be asked).\n\nHR round \u2014 Behavioural questions, a brief discussion on the CV\n\nHow to prepare for them?\n\nTest preparation \u2014 Complete InterviewBit during summers. Practice medium and hard difficulty level questions from leetcode.\n\nInterview preparation \u2014 Conventional code writing skills on paper/online editor, being very precise about standard algorithms, OOPs concepts, and being well versed with the projects/internships written in your CV is a must. Computer science fundamentals could be particularly vital for dual degree students. \u2018Heard on the Street\u2019 and \u2018Fifty Challenging Problems in Probability\u2019 are good resources for puzzles.\n\nGeneral advice \u2014 Prior to interviews, check the Salesforce Core Values. Even though they won\u2019t ask for it explicitly, a little knowledge about their values and culture might prove beneficial for you.\n\nWhat difficulties did you face while preparing for this Company/Profile? How did you overcome this problem?\n\nFinding the appropriate information to learn and practise with was the major challenge I encountered during my preparation for the software profile. There are a lot of resources on the internet for every single topic. For me, group preparation was the answer to this issue. Deciding upon which material to study and what all questions to practise is much easier in a group. Additionally, everyone keeps their motivation up the entire way.\n\nAccording to you, who should ideally apply for this job?\n\nAnyone who is really interested in working as a software developer in a top product-based company must apply for this job. If you appreciate a good work culture, then this is your destination. They have one of the best work cultures in the world.\n\nWhat are some of the major points you think would be valid to mention in your CV while targeting this profile? (Any specific suggestions you would like to make?)\n\nCV Tips for SDE profile:\n\nAny specific advice you want to give to the junta sitting for internships this year.\n\nDon\u2019t stress out if you\u2019re rejected by some company. Believe me, you have better opportunities awaiting. I know the process is very stressful but this is where you learn to handle pressure. Prepare well. Trust yourself. Never lose hope. Cheers!

        "content": "FORESIGHT(2022): Summer Internship at Honeywell | Compilation\n\n--\n\nListen\n\n1) Brief Introduction\n\nI am Abhishek S. Purohit, a final year undergraduate student in the Department of Chemical Engineering.\n\nI am Ashutosh Patkar from the Department of Ocean Engineering\n\nI am Prathmesh, a final year UG student from the QEDM branch, Department of Industrial and Systems Engineering.\n\nI am Mudit Gupta, a final year student in the department of chemistry.\n\nHi, I am Raushan Sharma, a final year undergraduate in the Department of Mathematics, IIT Kharagpur, enrolled in its 5-year Integrated M.Sc. course of Mathematics and Computing. Having a keen interest in mathematics, I love problem-solving and wish to apply my mathematical skills into solving practical problems and pain points.\n\nMy name is Rahul Kumawat, a third-year undergraduate student of the Department of Chemical Engineering enrolled in its B.Tech Course. I am from Jhunjhunu, Rajasthan.\n\nWe all got an internship offer from Honeywell for the SDE role through the on-campus CDC drive last year.\n\n2) How did you get into Honeywell? What was the selection procedure?\n\nFirst, we have to apply via ERP. It opens for every department and the CGPA criteria are >7.5.\n\nIt generally starts with an online coding test. It consists of 2 programming questions with a time limit of 1 hour. The test is conducted on the Hackerrank platform. Problems were related to Dynamic Programming, Graphs, Catalan numbers, etc. Someone who has decent practice from InterviewBit or Leetcode will find the problems familiar.\n\nLater, based on your score on the test and your CV, shortlisted people are allotted some panels for interviews. There are two rounds of interviews one -the technical round and the second one -the HR round.\n\nTECHNICAL ROUND \u2014 The Technical round very much depends on the interviewer. Some of them mostly ask questions like \u2014 What all graph traversal algorithms do we know, then explain how they work. What all Data structures we have studied and their properties Also , they ask about the time complexity of the radix sorting algorithm and discuss the projects done by that particular individual. Basic questions on OS, DBMS and some average questions on CP can be asked. Apart from these questions from your CV can be surely asked. Good projects on your CV would help you in driving interviews in your preferred direction. They give the interviewer some topics to discuss and assess you. Also having an in-depth understanding of the project and the ability to speak with confidence to convince the interviewer is an added advantage.\n\nHR ROUND \u2014 The HR round is generally a short one. Non-technical questions from CV are asked and some typical HR questions like your past experiences and what difference can you make if you were selected for this role. HR would be mostly interested in co-curricular activities, your ability to speak out your thoughts and most importantly whether you resonate with the company values or not. For the HR round, it is highly advisable going through the company\u2019s page and check out the current working domain of the company, as HR would expect you to have some knowledge of the company to which you are applying. Also check out company values.\n\n3) How to prepare for them?\n\nAns: Firstly, basic programming is a must for any software profile in any company. There will be easy to medium questions from them in the test. Clear all the concepts of standard data structures and algorithms and focus more on Dynamic programming as this topic is asked almost in every company\u2019s test. Study about OOPS concept, and its different components and also practice live coding.\n\nAs far as coding tests are concerned, you should practice CP at least for around 2 months to get a good grip on it. You could refer to platforms like leetcode, CodeChef & GFG for practicing questions because questions will be very similar from these platforms. You could also refer to the Algozenith course and the 10xIITian platform to learn about CP concepts.\n\nFor technical interviews, prepare your CV very well, everything from your CV should be at your fingertips and practice quality problems on leetcode or interviewbit. Stay confident while answering and don\u2019t panic during the interview. Never code in an interview like you know everything about the problem, try to interact with the interviewer, ask doubts and if no doubt then tell him what you are doing to solve the problem and why you are doing it then only the interviewer will take interest in you, ask for hints if you are stuck anywhere, the interviewer is there to help you, he/she just wants to check your thought process.\n\nFor interviews, one may follow the book \u201cCracking the Coding Interview\u201d, and go through Interview experiences from GFG.\n\nSome material for DP from our side \u2013\n\n1. https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_z_8CaSLPWekqhdCPmFohncHwz8TY2Go\n\n(To learn DP from Basics)\n\n2. https://atcoder.jp/contests/dp\n\nFor the HR round, prepare some standard HR questions (which can easily be found on google) and in the interview be active and listen carefully to HR. Go through the company\u2019s profile, its main working domains, its culture and values.\n\n4) What difficulties did you face while preparing for this Company/Profile? How did you overcome this problem?\n\nCompetition is one of the most difficult aspects of becoming a software developer. To address this challenge, one must perform as many mock tests as possible. Having a good CGPA and a resume with relevant projects is always a plus, but it is not required. The most significant requirement in becoming a Software Developer is having excellent coding skills.\n\nCoding Interviews are very different from competitive programming. In interviews, you need to slowly build-up to the efficient solution without knowing the constraints. But in a competitive programming contest, the entire approach and mindset are dependent on the constraints. Being a CP guy can mess up the interviews a bit. Not directly looking at the constraints sometimes should be good enough to overcome this problem.\n\nWhen solving problems do not get stuck on a question if you are low on time.\n\nJust move on with the next question and later visit the unsolved question again.\n\nIf you were involved in ML from start, you would have a bit more orientation towards Python over C++. It is highly recommended to master one language for CP purposes and C++ is highly preferred for that.\n\nHowever, for CDC if one feels he/she has less time for preparation of this profile, and it\u2019s somewhat late to start CP, then start with InterviewBit.\n\nWhile preparing for CDC, you have to face rejections either in interviews or in coding tests. So you have to be mentally strong and believe in yourself during this period.\n\n5) According to you, who should ideally apply for this job?\n\nThose who are interested in building softwares, coding or handling big data, in general, can apply for this role. Honeywell offers a varied range of tech stacks and projects for interns from DevOps, Machine Learning, Webapps, MicroServices, Databases, etc. You may get a chance to work on these cutting technologies. Anyone interested in these can apply. Honeywell did not have any department or CG criteria in 2021. If data structures and algorithms are something that interests you, and you like problem-solving, you are good to go and apply for this job profile.\n\nAlso, the work-life balance is very good generally but in some teams, it can get a little bad.\n\n6) What are some of the major points you think would be valid to mention in your CV while targeting this profile? (any specific suggestions you would like to make?)\n\nCV is a very major aspect of every interview. It is better if you have content in your CV resonating with the role you are applying for.\n\nIf you have done a software or ML-related internship(s) or project(s), then you can mention that in the CV, it would definitely be a good topic to discuss in the interview. Apart from that, you can also mention your codeforces/codechef ratings, any good rank in codeforces/codechef/kickstart/hackercup round.\n\nApart from that you could also mention the relevant software-related course(s) if you have taken any from KGP or from MOOCs. Just be ready to answer questions on the tech stack mentioned in your CV.\n\n7) Any specific advice you want to give to the junta sitting for internships this year.\n\nTry to revise the required topics and concepts in a day before the interview. To get an idea about the interview give some mock interviews if you can or at least watch some mock interviews on YouTube and visit interview preparation sites like leetcode etc. and consistently solve the problems in a time-bound manner. If possible, solve and practice codes with your group of friends who have the same passion. In this way, you can learn many new concepts.\n\nPrepare your CV very well, and write only those things which you can defend. Stay confident and don\u2019t get stressed out. Ask twice if you don\u2019t understand the question. Always remember, it\u2019s not the right answer that matters, it\u2019s the approach that matters. The coding tests are hectic so try to get proper rest during break time. Maintain your enthusiasm on the day of the interview and don\u2019t get disheartened seeing your friends getting intern on Day 1 or Day 2, your time will surely come. All the best!"

        "content": "FORESIGHT(2022): Summer Internship at Disney+Hotstar| Dibyendu Biswas\n\n--\n\nListen\n\nIntroduction\n\nMy name is Dibyendu Biswas. I am a 3rd-year undergraduate student of the Department of Electronics and Electrical Communication engineering enrolled in its B.Tech course. I am a boarder of Pt. Madan Mohan Malvia hall of residence. I am from Kolkata, West Bengal.\n\nHow did you get into Hotstar? What was the selection procedure?\n\nI got an offer from Disney+Hotstar on Day 3 of the CDC Internship drive.\n\nSelection Process:\n\n1. Tests: As far as I remember there were 2\u20133 DSA questions, and some MCQs. 2. Interviews:\n\nThere were a total of 3 rounds including the HR round.\n\n1st Round: It was pretty simple, they asked to implement the data structure SETS using the concepts of OOPS in any language you want, there were some additional constraints to it like it can also store special characters, I don\u2019t remember them clearly but it was not that difficult. Then the interviewer asked some basic questions on OOPS and some questions on my projects like\u2026..Explain MVT structure in Django.\n\n2nd Round: It was a DSA round, the problem statement was something like this: Q1. You have K sorted linked list of size N, sort them into one linked list.\n\nSo I started with the basic approach with Time Complexity (K*N). Then optimized it to K*log(N) in the final approach, using PRIORITY QUEUE.\n\nQuestion 2 was much easier\n\nQ2. Write a program to calculate pow(x,n) in Time Complexity O(log(n)).\n\n3rd Round (HR Round): If you reach till HR Round, then Congratulations you have cracked the interviews and will get the offer from Hotstar :)\n\n3) How to prepare for them?\n\nPractice CP as much as you can from platforms like Codeforces, Codechef. And in the last 2 months complete Interviewbit. And prepare OOPS from gfg before going for the interview. You may also cover OS, Networking and DBMS. Some companies ask MCQs related to these topics in tests and even in interviews.\n\n4) What difficulties did you face while preparing for this Company/Profile? How did you overcome this problem?\n\n\u25cf The whole CDC process gets very hectic, because companies take tests throughout the day, from Morning 6 am to even at night 12pm \u2014 2am ( only leaving the Class hours) for a whole week, so eventually people skip classes to get some rest.\n\n\u25cf Then Interviews generally are conducted on the weekend. And again the process gets very hectic, you have to wait a long time for your chance. If you have multiple interviews on a day, you might also have to skip some interviews to give the others.\n\n\u25cf Then one thing that happened with me was, I was waiting for my turn for 1\u20132 hours (knowing they would take my interview). But then the CDC coordinator informed me at the end that I was in the waiting list of the company and the company already hired enough interns, so all the waiting list guys were rejected. So I got really disappointed at that point of time.\n\nMy suggestion would be that you stay put, don\u2019t give up and keep trying. Eventually after multiple rejections and struggles, you\u2019ll surely get an intern.\n\n5) According to you, who should ideally apply for this job?\n\nGuys looking for an opportunity in Software Development or an entry-level opportunity with good compensation can apply.\n\nPeople from almost all the departments can apply.\n\n6) Any specific advice you want to give to the junta sitting for internships this year. I would like to write some general DOs and DON\u2019Ts for CDC.\n\nDO\u2019s :\n\n\u25cf Be Honest, and Don\u2019t lie. Don\u2019t write something in your CV that when asked you are not able to explain it.\n\n\u25cf You must have 1 good development project or intern on your CV, and must have basic knowledge of the frameworks and libraries used in the project.\n\n\u25cf Dress to impress. Even if the company is casual, you should dress nicely in Formals.\n\nDON\u2019Ts:\n\n\u25cf Don\u2019t be quiet throughout your interview, keep talking to the interviewer, keep interacting with him/her. Even if you don\u2019t know the perfect answer to a question, keep engaging with the interviewer, they are there to help you out, give you hints and lastly they also want to see your communication skills during your interview.\n\n\u25cf Don\u2019t sleep late at night before your interview, generally the interviews start from 7 am in the morning. So make sure to have a good night\u2019s sleep.\n\n\u25cf Don\u2019t offend or cross-question the interviewer in any way.\n\n7) What are some of the major points you think would be valid to mention in your CV while targeting this profile? (any specific suggestions you would like to make?) \u25cf Firstly Hotstar was open to almost all the departments, and people from different deps were shortlisted for the interview, so you don\u2019t have to worry about not being from a circuital dep.\n\n\u25cf A good CG will be a plus point, mostly above 8\u20138.5 would be enough.\n\n\u25cf Then you must have 1 good development project or intern on your CV, and must have basic knowledge of the frameworks and libraries used in the project.\n\n\u25cf You can add your rankings of various coding contests like Kickstart, Codeforces, Codechef, etc."

        "content": "FORESIGHT(2022): Summer Internship at ITC | Ayush Sahoo\n\n--\n\nListen\n\nBrief Introduction\n\nHey, this is Ayush Sahoo, I just completed my third year in Instrumentation Engineering of the Electrical Department. I have been selected for the KITES ITC internship via CDC, IIT Kgp and I am willing to share some important information regarding the same,\n\nHow did you get into ITC? What was the selection procedure?\n\nThe complete process is summarized as under:\n\n1. Online Application: Interested students are required to apply through an online portal where a form is required to be filled out. The form essentially requires details from your resume and some essay-type questions to be answered mentioning your goals and motivation to join ITC.\n\n2. Shortlisting: Based on the form filled, a shortlist is issued for the psychometric test. The information that you fill in this form is reassessed at various stages from your personality test to the point then you actually join one of the divisions of ITC and serve as a medium for the company (and especially your guides and mentors) to know you.\n\n3. Psychometric Test: This test is designed to evaluate your intelligence, personality and decision-making skills through some situational questions. The aim is to check if you are a good fit for the company\u2019s work environment or not. The rejection rate at this stage is negligible and you will pass through unless you decide to deliberately screw it up.\n\n4. Group Discussion: The students selected from the psychometric test are divided in groups of 7\u20138 for the group discussion round. This stage of the selection procedure is designed to judge your people handling and convincing skills. The reading time given to you is about 5 minutes, hence, you need to be really quick in grasping the essence of the problem and coming up with logical arguments. The problems may range from discussing upcoming business strategies for a product or simply just discussing the best course of action after an accident. These case problems do not require any prior preparation but you are expected to be logically sound in your arguments and be able to convince your audience for the same. The number of students selected from a GD is not fixed and may range from 1\u20134 per GD.\n\n5. Personal Interview: This is the last stage of the selection procedure and in my opinion the most interesting one, the reason you\u2019ll get to know in the following paragraphs:\n\na. Technical Round: Based on your CV they ask random questions, I had a core profile in electrical engineering and also practiced quite a bit of CP earlier from January, but I was asked questions mostly from the core electrical domain and real-life problems based on core electrical engineering\n\nb. HR Round: This round is basically an interaction between the student and some senior officials from the company who are interested in knowing your interest in working with them.\n\nHow to prepare for them?\n\nI think the CV shortlisting criteria is purely based on CGPA, apart from this having a good grip over the core subjects is quite important to crack the technical rounds. Apart from that if you have mentioned other things like data structures, CP, ML, etc too in your core CV(if they are linked in any way to the projects that you have done) then questions might be asked from those fields as well.\n\nWhat difficulties did you face while preparing for this Company/Profile? How did you overcome this problem?\n\nFor me the problem was mainly in GD, I did not have much prior experience in this but I believe the topics are intuitive and if we are able to articulate well and convey our points then it\u2019s easy to crack. One point to be kept in mind is that there is no actual winner or loser in a discussion, just put your point of view to HR as to why you feel your suggestion would sustain in the scenario.\n\nAccording to you, who should ideally apply for this job?\n\nThe internship role is Techno-managerial based, so people who want to pursue management-based jobs or are interested in the same can have good kickstart and experience while interning at ITC, without leaving their technical background completely.\n\nWhat are some of the major points you think would be valid to mention in your CV while targeting this profile? (any specific suggestions you would like to make?)\n\nThe most important thing which I believe is you have to be thorough with your CV. The interviewer asks for every single detail that we mention, so no point writing things in which you are not confident about. Hence, mention only the relevant projects or previous internships in which you have complete surety and credibility.\n\nAny specific advice you want to give to the junta sitting for internships this year\n\nI think the selection process is refined enough to check each and every aspect for the profile. Personally, I didn\u2019t have any previous internships in the supply chain/ management domain, so there is no such hard and fast rule to have the same but as I said early if we have mentioned projects or internships based on any field eg core, software, etc. we have to thorough with each and every aspect of it because companies like ITC have branches in nearly every category starting from FMCG to IT as well as healthcare."

What was the selection procedure?\n\nSelection: Was based on CV. I had a course project on Algo I under PPC sir, an ISRO project of UART implementation on FPGA.Google Hardware Interview Experience : There were two sets of interviews.Round 1: I was mostly asked questions from basic digital electronics FSM(Finite state machine) related questions. I was asked to draw the state transition diagram for a particular question. Then I was asked a question from analog regarding opamp. Then I told them that I mainly prepared for digital, so I would prefer if they asked questions from that. Then they gave me alogical question and asked me to implement it using digital circuits. It was related to binary search. Then they asked a few questions regarding programming and basic flip flops, latches and combinational circuits. Finally, he asked me for 1\u20132 puzzles, and that\u2019s it. Even if you can\u2019t answer the question perfectly, telling them your approach will help a lot.\n\nRound 2: Round 2 began with a complicated question on static timing analysis where a bigcircuit was given, and I had to explain every stage of how I approached it. They asked a question on K-map minimisation and then computer architecture basics like RAM, ROM,Cache and ISA. Lastly, they asked me a question on recursion(coding in C++). I solved it using both recursion and dynamic programming and they were very happy to see that.\n\nHow to prepare for them?\n\nI aimed for the core- digital profile. So, I started my preparation from the summer after the end of my 4th semester. I went through a few courses on Digital Electronics (Neso Academy lectures), a basic course on ComputerSystem and Architecture(basics from gfg), Static Timing analysis concepts. Knowledge about VHDL/Verilog is also recommended if time permits. I studied them thoroughly. Lastly, I revised my programming, data structure, and algorithms concepts (Since my second profile was software, I was also practicing from Interviewbit, which helped me a lot). I also briefly wentthrough puzzle questions from the interview bit and gfg.\n\nAny specific advice you want to give to the junta sitting for internships this year.\n\nI got COVID positive at the end of April and basically began my preparations from May mid. I started with the NESO playlist of digital first and practiced questions which I gathered from past papers and seniors. I contacted Nagesh Patle, Rudrajyoti Roy and Hima Swetha, who also interned in core profiles. I asked them many questions to clear my concepts. Keeping in touchwith seniors was a huge plus point as they guided me with their interview experience and field expertise. When the interview time was approaching, I also prepared the basics of computer architecture. I learnt VHDL as it was required in my ISRO project which helped me in the interview too. Due to the increased stress in CDC, you must take care of yourself. Do some exercise, get proper sleep and keep in touch with your friends. You have to give lots of tests,face rejections too, still keep on fighting. You need to keep calm, trust yourself, and utilize the summer break efficiently to bag an excellent core offer. That\u2019s it from my side. Thank you! You are free to contact me on my\n\nmy emailhaitdebdatta@gmail.com.\n\nAll the best. Machake!!"

I received an offer from Texas Instruments in the Signal Processing Profile during my 4th year.\n\nHow did you get into Texas Instruments? What was the selection procedure?\n\nI bagged the internship via the Career Development Centre (CDC) campus internship drive. The selection procedure for the internship includes an objective type screening test based on the different broad topics (Analog, Digital, Signal Processing, and Programming), based on the results of which we get interviews for different profiles. There is also a puzzle section for the objective exam, which is compulsory. One can apply for more than one profile and thus may receive multiple interviews for different profiles. In the end, you must choose one particular profile for your internship.\n\nHow to prepare for them?\n\nAs far as preparation is concerned, most of the things asked in interviews are taken from the ECE courses, which must be revised before the internship drive starts. Some topics are generally not covered in lectures, like static and hold time and cache access time and hit ratio, which should be studied for the digital profile. A summary of all the necessary topics for each of the companies is given in the link below, which was compiled by Gautam Jha, a senior of mine.\n\nCDC Guide for E&ECE Core companies\n\nWhat difficulties did you face while preparing for this Company/Profile? How did you overcome this problem?\n\nI was doing an internship, the summer before my CDC internship drive, and hence I had lesser time to revise the subjects than some of my classmates. So, in this case, I had to dedicate some time in the week (during my internship) to revise my course subjects.\n\nAccording to you, who should ideally apply for this job?\n\nThese roles are generally open for people of circuit branches already familiar with pre-requisite knowledge of each of these profiles.\n\nAny specific advice you want to give to the junta sitting for internships this year?\n\nI wanted to let the students who want to go for core ECE/EE internships know that there are a lot of openings in this sector, and they should not be worried about securing an internship. Suppose they are unable to secure internships at Google Hardware on Day 1 or Nvidia and Texas Instruments on Day 2 (the first week of results). In that case, they should not be disheartened as many companies come for campusing in the latter days of the internship drive, like Qualcomm, Micron, Intel, Samsung, and many others who also look for people having similar profiles.\n\nWhat are some of the major points you think would be valid to mention in your CV while targeting this profile?(any specific suggestions you would like to make?)\n\nYou could mention the courses you have taken relevant to your profile. As far as mentioning projects and PORs, they are of little importance if they do not apply to your profile. Irrespective of what points you write in the CV, the interviewer will test you on the basic concepts of the subject."

Shaw this summer for a period of two months.\n\nHow did you get into DE Shaw? What was the selection procedure?\n\nI applied through the official CDC portal and after cv shortlisting there were two phases, Online coding round on Hackerrank and then interviews on Day1.

Do note that SQL and ProbStat are questioned only after asking the student if they know it.\n\nHow to prepare for them?\n\nSolving Interviewbit/leetcode might not be sufficient for online coding rounds and consistent practice on other platforms like codeforces is recommended. For SQL, basic queries are asked and hackerrank has a good collection on that.

Tech).\n\nI am currently interning at Piramal Pharma Solutions, Riverview, Michigan as a GEL Intern in the field of Supply Chain & Logistics.\n\nHow did you get into Piramal? What was the selection procedure?\n\nSo, Piramal recruits for it\u2019s Global Emerging Leaders (GEL) Internship Programme from the old 5 IITs only. There are 3 rounds of selection post a general CV shortlist. The first round is a gamified assessment testing your analytical skills followed by a GD round and finally a Personal Interview. Do note, that as of last year, they only recruit students from the Chemical Engineering Department.\n\nThe gamified assessment is similar to the one FMCG firms conduct for hiring and hacks can be found on YouTube to ace the same.\n\nThe GD is based to test your personality and evaluate a role-fit for a management/leadership role. Unlike general GDs, in our case, every candidate was given 1.5 minutes strictly to introduce themselves, answer a situational judgement case study question (FMCG hiring 101) and tell them something we were passionate about.\n\nMy personal interview was taken by a Senior VP & an HR. It revolved mostly around my CV. There were a few simple questions related to basic core principles and a few regarding Supply Chain & Business Strategy as I had mentioned it on my CV. The HR would stress more on your communication skills and the POR/Extracurricular section.\n\nHow to prepare for them?\n\nA well-balanced CV with spikes in a few sections would be sufficient to get an initial shortlist. There is no CGPA cutoff/bias. One needs to have decent communication skills to clear the rest of the rounds. Decent knowledge of either core principles or relevant Supply Chain theory is important to clear the Personal Interview Round.\n\nWhat difficulties did you face while preparing for this Company/Profile? How did you overcome this problem?\n\nThe only concepts you need to be well-versed with include your core principles/Supply Chain concepts. I chose the latter, hence it would be beneficial if you read up a few problems and concepts related to general Supply Chains along with latest news, technological developments in the Pharma industry. Research well about the firm and develop reasoning as to how you can solve problems relevant to the firm with skills mentioned in your CV.\n\nAccording to you, who should ideally apply for this job?\n\nPiramal offers projects in the field of Business Scale using core engineering principles and Strategic Projects in the field of Logistics & Supply Chain. Hence, students who are interested in either should be an ideal fit. The company culture is worth pointing out and the stipend provided is quite attractive if that falls under your consideration.\n\nAny specific advice you want to give to the junta sitting for internships this year.\n\nThis period was honestly the most stressful point during my KGP life. Hence, I would lay a lot of emphasis on students to please take good care of themselves during the same. Please reach out to your family, friends & seniors at any point of time and keep yourself motivated even if you do not secure an internship in the first week. Fantastic opportunities are waiting for you, hence please do not give up and keep up the grind. Wishing you all the best for the same!\n\nWhat are some of the major points you think would be valid to mention in your CV while targeting this profile?(any specific suggestions you would like to make?)\n\nPlease review your CV thoroughly with your seniors and be extremely well versed with every word written. Specifically for this role, highlight the impact you\u2019ve created in your projects, achievements and showcase your management skills through your POR & Extra-Curricular Sections. If there are any internships/competitions that are relevant to the Pharma/Supply Chain field, it would be an added plus to talk about during your interviews."

I am Tanaya Ramane, a fourth-year Dual Degree student from the Department of Industrial & Systems Engineering, enrolled in its Quality Engineering Design & Manufacturing course. I am interning at Limechat as part of its Product team in the summer of 2022.\n\nHow did you get into Limechat? What was the selection procedure?\n\nIn the CDC internship drive, the number of companies coming for products is generally less. Limechat came on Day-3 for two profiles, Software, and Product. For Product in the initial CV shortlist, around 8 people were shortlisted. Out of which, 3 of us were offered an internship at the end.\n\nThe interview was divided into three phases essentially:\n\n1: CV grilling \u2014 Based on relevant past projects and how they would align with the intern role\n\n2. Product Case study \u2014 I was asked about a product case study of building an app from scratch\n\n3. HR round \u2014 Example: Questions mostly about why Product over any other role\u2026\n\nHow to prepare for them?\n\nFor CV grilling:\n\n1. Make sure you are thorough with what you write in your CV\n\n2. You can drive the interview flow, so choose your words wisely. In my case, I knew which of my interns would be the most relevant and deliberately mentioned that role in my answers. This eventually led the interviewer to ask me questions about that particular role.\n\nFor Product Case Study -\n\nGeneral Awareness\n\nGood problem-solving skills\n\nHave a structured approach and try to think of MECE buckets\n\nAsking the right questions, mainly to clarify the problem statements and even within the case\n\nHave a two-way conversation, don\u2019t just deep dive into the case and give a final output, have discussions with the interviewer.\n\nAfter the case, ask for feedback: do you want me to explore any other aspect of this case?\n\nIs the solution feasible?\n\nIf you are quoting any problem, instead of simply assuming, convey that to the interviewer: I think that the main issue faced by our users is XYZ. Does the company face a problem with this? Should I look into this? Etc.\n\nHR Round:\n\nYou can get plenty of videos for this out there, and this is something that you need to look out for once you get a shortlist\n\nThese are all straightforward and basic tips, but people often panic over the interview and miss out on a few. Just brainstorm as much as you can on the case, and keep the interviewer in the loop. Please don\u2019t make it a one-sided monologue!\n\nAccording to you, who should ideally apply for this job?\n\nI don\u2019t think I would be the best person to comment on this(because I\u2019m also a naive beginner, I would say\ud83d\ude05). There are, again, many youtube videos out there for this.\n\nI believe product roles require two primary skills:\n\nProblem-solving\n\nStakeholder Management\n\nYou need to take the initiative and look for improvements, come up with possible solutions, develop an implementation plan, check if it\u2019s feasible, and get validation from the customers by experimenting. And for all this, you need to work with multiple stakeholders. So, if you are someone who enjoys these things and loves to work across cross-functional teams, then this space might work well for you.\n\nWhat are some of the major points you think would be valid to mention in your CV while targeting this profile? (any specific suggestions you would like to make?)\n\nAn all-rounded CV is preferred(that\u2019s what I\u2019ve heard), and past interns in Product might help. Idk about the exact shortlisting criteria, so I won\u2019t be able to comment much on this part.\n\nAny specific advice you want to give to the junta sitting for internships this year.\n\nThe CDC process is daunting. It\u2019s fine if you don\u2019t get an internship through CDC. There are a lot of opportunities off-campus, especially in product roles. Make sure you talk to your parents/friends, whoever you are comfortable sharing your bt with!\n\nDon\u2019t lose hope/confidence, even if you are not able to make it. Your career is a 30+ years journey ahead. 1/2 years up and down hardly contributes to 3% of it. So don\u2019t give up hopes, keep hustling, and you can find a career that satisfies you!"

I am Sadha Sivam M, a 3rd-year undergraduate student from the Department of Mechanical Engineering at IIT Kharagpur. I am from Madurai, Tamilnadu. I am currently doing my summer internship at Bajaj Auto. Looking forward to sharing my experience!\n\nHow did you get into Bajaj Auto? What was the selection procedure?\n\nI applied to Bajaj Auto through the CDC Internship portal.\n\nThe selection process:\n\nThe selection process involves 2 rounds of tests and 2 rounds of interviews.\n\nHow to prepare for them?\n\nRound 1 \u2014 Aptitude and Technical Assessment:\n\nThis test comprises 2 sections \u2014 Aptitude (Analytical Reasoning, Quantitative, English) and Technical.\n\nThe Aptitude section was quite simple, practicing regular aptitude questions from various sites online will be more than sufficient to score well in this section. The technical section, as anyone would expect, was the complicated one. The questions were asked from IC Engines, materials, failure theories, thermodynamic cycles, fluid mechanics, etc. Revising class notes of all the core courses and practicing GATE questions would be helpful to answer this section.\n\nIf you are shortlisted in the technical assessment you will receive a link for a Psychometric assessment which is the second round of the tests. It doesn\u2019t require any special preparation. It is enough to be consistent with your answers throughout the questionnaire.\n\nRound 2 \u2014 Interview(Technical and HR):\n\nThe first round was the technical interview. After finishing my introduction I was asked to pick my favorite project from my resume and explain it. The interviewers interrupted and asked questions during my explanation. They also asked a few conceptual questions based on the other projects on my resume. The interview lasted for around 20 minutes and I was shortlisted for the HR round.\n\nIn the HR round, the interviewer asked a few general questions and it was more about whether I was interested to work in the company. I would like to give only a couple of advices for the HR round \u2014 Express your interest to work in the company and at the end when the interviewer asks if you have any questions to ask, do ask a question or two about the company or any job-related queries.\n\nWhat difficulties did you face while preparing for this Company/Profile? How did you overcome this problem?\n\nAs I wasn\u2019t a Dual Degree student, I faced difficulties while preparing for the technical assessment. A few topics like IC engines, failure theories, etc, are taught only in the 3rd year, hence it was quite challenging for me to prepare these topics for the test. I took the help of various GATE preparation resources to get an understanding of these topics which helped me during the test.\n\nAccording to you, who should ideally apply for this job?\n\nAnyone who is into core mechanical/electrical engineering should apply for an internship at Bajaj Auto. If you think you are good with the fundamentals of your branch and enjoy working in the core field you should go for it. It is an advantage if you have projects/interns in the core field.\n\nWhat are some of the major points you think would be valid to mention in your CV while targeting this profile?\n\nMentioning projects related to core, research interns in the core field, any other intern(at a startup), or research society involvements(TeamKart, AGV, etc.) in the CV could help you immensely during the interview. Having any of these in your resume will help you to steer the interview to the areas in which you are comfortable.\n\nAny specific advice you want to give to the junta sitting for internships this year.\n\nThe overall CDC internship process is unpredictable, it can become extremely cumbersome and hectic. From my personal experience, if you are someone who wants to pursue core, patience is something you will require the most. You will see your non-core friends getting shortlisted and receiving offers everyday and even, some of your friends in core who have a little experience might get a good offer from a non-core company, these little things could make you anxious and might dent your confidence, but it is very important for you to back your decision and stay true to your intent. At any point in time don\u2019t get into the fear that you aren\u2019t good enough, just be confident and keep going! All the Best!"

Leetcode.com has standard problems which are also helpful for the same.\n\nGiving online contests on this website is also very important. It teaches you to write the entire code, debug and consider the corner-cases too within the timeframe. Practice a lot. Solving all the questions quickly becomes important in placement coding tests because the competition is high.\n\nMake sure you give mock interviews before sitting for actual interviews in placements.\n\nWhat difficulties did you face while preparing for this Company/Profile? How did you overcome this problem?\n\nMost top companies look for students from the circuit department or the ones who are exceptionally good in coding. Therefore, to be a relevant candidate, I practiced a lot of programming from leetcode and codeforces. I also improved my CGPA, while learning some concepts such as DBMS and OS.\n\nAccording to you, who should ideally apply for this job?\n\nAll the technology enthusiasts and students who love coding should apply for this job.\n\nAny specific advice you want to give to the junta sitting for placements this year.\n\nStudy smart, practice a lot, prepare well. Getting selected in a particular company is not in your hands. A lot of external factors play a role in that. All you can do is work hard and improve yourself. Don\u2019t get demotivated as it will affect your preparation. Some days you will feel low, and it\u2019s completely okay. Take a small break and continue your preparation again. You will get good results. Believe in yourself. Make a study group if possible.\n\nGive mock interviews. Try to explain your code as much as possible. Spoon-feed everything to the interviewer; don\u2019t just assume that they will know about it since it\u2019s a basic thing. Communication skills are also important.\n\nWhat are some of the major points you think would be valid to mention while targeting this profile? (Any specific suggestions you would like to make?)\n\nMake your CV relevant to the profile you\u2019re applying for. Don\u2019t dilute your CV by adding extra non-related stuff. Also, write only those things which you are confident about."

        "content": "FORESIGHT(2022): Summer Internship at Goldman Sachs| Rishav Kumar\n\n--\n\n1\n\nListen\n\nBrief Introduction\n\nHi Everyone ! I am Rishav Kumar, a third-year B.Tech student from the department of Electronics and Electrical Communication Engineering. I will be interning at Goldman Sachs as part of its Engineering Division in the summers of 2022.\n\nHow did you get into GS? What was the selection procedure?\n\nThe selection procedure consisted of an online round which was conducted on Hackerrank platform a few weeks before the interview. It consisted of 5 sections :\n\nSection 1 (Easy Programming Round)\n\nThere were two questions, both implementation based. Questions were easy but the time limit was 30 minutes. Unfortunately, I took too much time in the first question due to minor bugs and was able to solve only one of them.\n\nSection 2 (Quantitative Aptitude)\n\nThe questions in this section were tough (JEE level). The topics covered were Probability, Expectation Values, Trigonometry and logical reasoning. Since I didn\u2019t prepare for the quant profile specifically, I was able to answer only one or two questions from this section.\n\nSection 3 (CS Fundamentals)\n\nThis section consisted of theoretical questions from core CS subjects like Operating Systems, Computer Networks, Predicting output of a given code. I was able to solve around 30\u201340 % of the questions.\n\nSection 4 (Hard Programming Round)\n\nThere was only one question with a time limit of 45 minutes. The question was arguably one of the hardest questions asked in CDC that year. It was based on profile DP (DP + Bitmasking). It took me around 30 minutes to code the solution and 5 minutes to debug. As I had solved a similar question before, I knew straight away how the general structure of the solution would look like. I was able to pass all the test cases.\n\nSection 5 (Behavioral/HR essay-type question)\n\nThe questions were :\n\nWhat will you do if your teammate leaves you in the middle of the project due to some personal issues ?\n\nMention a situation where your passion and enthusiasm helped you in achieving the goal.\n\nTime limit was 15 minutes. The exact same questions were asked in previous year\u2019s round. I was prepared with a suitable answer for each of these questions.\n\nThere was another criterion for selection which was CGPA. Performing well in any one of the subsections (Coding / Quant) was enough to be called for an interview. Around 80 people were shortlisted for the interviews.\n\nRound 1\n\nThe round started off with a basic implementation question.The interviewer just wanted to see if I could convert my thoughts into code. He then asked me a puzzle. I was told that I could solve the problem either logically or by writing code. After a few minutes of brainstorming I wrote a recursive code and arrived at the final answer.\n\nRound 2\n\nI wasn\u2019t required to code in this round. The interviewer just asked me theoretical questions on various well-known algorithms like Dijkstra, Manhattan, CPU Scheduling, etc. I was also asked a bit about my projects.\n\nRound 3\n\nThe round consisted of a medium-hard level question. It was based on DP on a binary tree. It took me a while to code up the solution. Initially the interviewer wasn\u2019t able to understand my solution as I had optimized the space complexity to O(1) but after a few minutes of discussion he was satisfied. He then asked me about my project with a few follow-up questions.\n\nThere was no HR round. I received the confirmation about two hours later that I have been selected.\n\nHow to prepare for them?\n\nI initially came to know about Competitive Programming from some of my friends during the start of my 2nd semester. I started with beginner level problems on Codechef and Hackerrank. Soon I realized the importance of Data Structures and Algorithms in CP and decided to learn it thoroughly.\n\nInitially I followed the videos of mycodeschool youtube channel and then moved to cp-algorithms website. Meanwhile I kept solving questions and participated in as many contests as I could.\n\nAfter reaching the fourth semester I realized that my ratings were stable and I couldn\u2019t improve them even after upsolving the questions. It was at this time that I decided to join the AZ-201 course of AlgoZenith. The course covered everything from scratch. The questions on the platform were quite relevant from the CDC point of view. Meanwhile, I also took the Algorithms-I and Algorithms-I Lab courses as additionals. All these resources were enough to provide me with a firm grasp on DSA skills.\n\nIn the summer break before CDC I moved on to platforms like InterviewBit and LeetCode to prepare for interview rounds. I solved interviewBit completely and did around 150 most liked questions on LeetCode. I also worked on two small projects (one on NLP and the other on Blockchain) and implemented them from scratch.\n\nWhat difficulties did you face while preparing for this Company/Profile? How did you overcome this problem?\n\nOne of the biggest setbacks that I faced during my preparation was not being able to push my ratings above a certain limit (5-star on CodeChef and Expert on Codeforces). However I soon realized that the questions on these platforms were more towards the ad-hoc side rather than DSA. Consequently, I shifted to other platforms like LeetCode and focused more on improving my DSA skills rather than worrying about my ratings.\n\nAccording to you, who should ideally apply for this job?\n\nPeople who have a keen interest in the Software Development domain with a slight interest in Finance should ideally apply for this internship program.\n\nAny specific advice you want to give to the junta sitting for internships this year.\n\nPractice Competitive Programming. There\u2019s no shortcut to that at all. CP won\u2019t just help you in grabbing an internship/placement offer, but also helps to improve problem-solving skills, builds aptitude and spontaneous thinking.\n\nAsk questions to the interviewer. At times they make the question unclear purposefully hoping that you may ask for clarifications.\n\nThink out loud during the interview, so that the interviewer knows your thought process and may guide you towards the solution.\n\nDon\u2019t panic. Keep a smile on your face and a calm head.\n\nDon\u2019t worry too much about ratings, focus on learning.\n\nDon\u2019t get demotivated after seeing your friends get an offer in a Day1 company. Some of the companies that come later are equally good as Day1 companies.\n\nWhat are some of the major points you think would be valid to mention in your CV while targeting this profile?(any specific suggestions you would like to make?)\n\nHaving a project on your CV really gives you an edge over others. Not only does it help you to understand software development but also becomes a major point of discussion during your interviews. Having good ranks in coding competitions like Google Kickstart, Google CodeJam, ICPC also adds value to your resume.\n\nLastly, be thorough with your resume. Don\u2019t write anything on your CV which you won\u2019t be able to explain.\n\nRemember, it\u2019s okay not to get a good offer initially as you will get lots of opportunities in the future. Just try giving your best. Feel free to ping me on Facebook/LinkedIn for any questions :)\n\nAll the best."

        "content": "FORESIGHT(2022): Summer Internship at Nvidia | Anubhav Prasad\n\n--\n\nListen\n\nBrief Introduction\n\nHello, my name is Anubhav Prasad. I\u2019m from the ECE department. I\u2019m also a member of KRSSG\u2019s electronics and embedded team. I\u2019m from Hajipur, Bihar.\n\nHow did you get into NVIDIA ? What was the selection procedure?\n\nThere are two steps in total, one is an exam and the 2nd is the interview round.\n\nApprox 19 questions were asked in total and the time given was 1 hour. Questions spanned the concepts of digital electronics, PDS (1st year) and probabilities. The difficulty of the paper was moderate. I got some previous year's questions from the JKR funda Facebook page and to my surprise, some questions were exactly the same with different data.\n\nFor the interview Nvidia came on day 2. Mine Was the 1st interview. There were two interviewers, one was a kgpian (don\u2019t remember his batch). So it started with the introduction part and then some random talks related to video games and GPUs. After that the 2nd guy started asking me questions like what is your interest, why you want to join Nvidia, do you want to go for higher studies, etc. It went for roughly 5 minutes and then the 1st interviewer (kgpian) started asking me technical questions. It started with some coding-based questions (basics of sorting) and then followed by a test question which I solved wrong (calculation mistake). So then I did that in front of him and also told him the method. He then asked me questions related to flip flops, multiplexers, etc. After that, he asked me whether I have knowledge of computer architecture and verilog or not. Since it wasn\u2019t covered in my course, I told them I do know basic stuff but not properly. He then asked me whether I know memory hierarchy and pipelining hazards or not. I told them whatever I knew in short. After that the 2nd interviewer gave me a puzzle. I already knew the answer to that so I told them step by step and well that was my final question, after that we talked about some random stuff for 2\u20133 mins and the interview was over.\n\nHow to prepare for them?\n\nFor preparations there, the very 1st step should be digital electronics. One should be very clear with the concepts of digital electronics, (all small modules like adder, multiplexer, flip-flops, etc). Then try implementing flip-flops with 2-to-1, or 4-to-1 multiplexers. Once you\u2019re confident with this stuff, then learn verilog and try implementing all the learned modules in verilog and try writing testbenches in it. It will give you an idea about how IC\u2019s are designed. Circuit solving methods like KCL, KVL should be clear. Go through the response of the RLC circuits (important for other companies as well). Revise the concepts of PDS (taught in 1st year) that\u2019s enough but additionally if interested you may go through STL, as a year before my CDC a question was asked on vectors.\n\nOnce the above mentioned concepts are clear enough you can go through computer architecture. Memory hierarchy, Pipelining and its hazards are the most important concepts. Some VLSI concepts are also very important like static timing analysis (setup and hold time). Below are the links for computer architecture and VLSI stuff.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0c7M_eEmLE&list=PL9un8tgZngo9-Y5dmi8Fh4dJEMixX6mz7&ab_channel=ComputerArchitectureandOrganization\n\nhttp://www.vlsi-expert.com/p/static-timing-analysis.html\n\nAlthough they won\u2019t ask questions from these concepts if you\u2019re a 2nd-year student. If you don\u2019t know then tell them that these courses aren\u2019t covered yet. Then they will ask you questions from the basis only.\n\nFor puzzles, just go through the 1st chapter of heard on the street book. That\u2019s more than enough\n\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/1SAizAj7x8jbfOgjCvQjYqEpUnVp6Xh6o/view?usp=sharing\n\nWhat difficulties did you face while preparing for this Company/Profile? How did you overcome this problem\n\nI don\u2019t face any difficulties as such while preparing. I was pretty sure that I don\u2019t want to sit for SDE or other roles. I just wanted to sit for core profile (digital only). Staying in contact with friends helps a lot as one starts to panic as the CDC is approaching. I would advise you to keep faith in you and be confident. Have proper food, sleep, do regular workouts to be physically and mentally fit and just focus on learning rather than running for different profiles.\n\nAccording to you, who should ideally apply for this job?\n\nIf you are interested in knowing the process of what goes into designing these complex devices capable of running high quality video games, high computation, etc then you should definitely give it a shot. Digital design is a vast and interesting field. If you are still in a dilemma in selecting a profile, I would suggest that try this as well. It won\u2019t take much time to cover the concepts. The new curriculum already covered the digital electronics stuff so it won\u2019t take much time to prepare for it.\n\nAny specific advice you want to give to the junta sitting for internships this year.\n\nBe clear with whatever you write in your CV. Don\u2019t just fake stuff. If you are not confident with anything that you have written then it\u2019s better not to write it.\n\nKeep interacting with interviewers during the interview. Don\u2019t just be quiet, keep talking to them, tell them your approach. It will boost your confidence. They also give hints if you are stuck somewhere, and also it makes a good impression if you keep interacting. Don\u2019t worry if you are not confident in speaking English, proceed with Hindi. They don\u2019t judge the language at all.\n\nBe in touch with family and friends, it helps a lot. Be happy and keep learning.\n\nWhat are some of the major points you think would be valid to mention in your CV while targeting this profile?(any specific suggestions you would like to make?)\n\nWell they don\u2019t focus much on CV, throughout my interview they didn\u2019t ask anything from my CV. They just saw it once and asked about my field of interest. So it\u2019s better to focus on making the fundamentals clear rather than running to make a good CV.\n\nFor CV try to include a hardware project if possible, although not that important but still good to be on the safe side. I would suggest going through the course \u201cNAND2TETRIS\u201d part 1 on Coursera. It\u2019s a project-oriented course and much fun to learn. Additionally, there are websites like fpga4student.com, etc. You may have a look at it if you have time but only after having the fundamentals strong.\n\nFinally all the best for the upcoming CDC. Happy learning. Be safe and healthy.\n\nIn case you need any help then feel free to text me.\n\nEmail: anubhav84prasad@gmail.com\n\nWhatsApp number: 7076168555\n\nLinkedIn: www.linkedin.com/in/anubhav84prasad"

        "content": "FORESIGHT(2022): Summer Internship at Bajaj Auto| Suryadeep Mandal\n\n--\n\nListen\n\nBrief Introduction\n\nHi, I am Suryadeep Mandal. I am a fourth-year undergraduate student in the Department of Electrical Engineering. I am currently an intern at Bajaj Auto in its R&D EEE Department. My project here is on the accurate calculation of power losses in a motor controller for varying drive cycles.\n\nHow did you get into Bajaj Auto? What was the selection procedure?\n\nThere was an initial MCQ test based on which shortlisting was done for the interview. The test consisted of English, General Aptitude, and Technical questions. For Electrical Engineering, technical questions were mostly from Power Electronics and Electrical Machines and were either theory-based or involved one or two small calculations. A few questions were also from Basic Electronics.\n\nAfter shortlisting, there were two rounds of interviews \u2013\n\nTechnical Round \u2014 General questions were asked from Basic Electronics and Electrical Machines. I had written in my CV that in a project I had designed a few circuits for the safety of automotive systems, so they told me to show them those circuits and asked me a few specific questions based on those (Relay Drivers, PWM, etc.)\n\nHR Round \u2014 After the technical interview, I received a call for the HR round within thirty minutes. HR first asked me to go through my CV and justify why I was suited for the internship role. Then, he asked a few questions like why I was not going for any other automotive company, what my future plans were, etc.\n\nAfter the HR round, I received a call from the CDC Representative about my selection by Bajaj Auto within an hour.\n\nHow to prepare for them?\n\nFor four-year students, revising the coursework on Electrical Machines would help. It would be great if you can utilise the rest of the summer vacation from now on and learn about Power Electronics. For five-year students, revising Electrical Machines and Power Electronics would be very helpful. A project will certainly provide you with an edge over others in the interviews. For those of you who do not know, Prof. Dipankar Debnath has some projects in these fields and is very approachable, so you can try to get a project under him.\n\nInstrumentation guys do not have either Electrical Machines or Power Electronics in their coursework, so you have to work a bit harder during the summers studying both these subjects if you want to crack the test. Do not be worried though, questions are fairly easy so you need not go into much depth.\n\nFor the technical interview, be thorough with your CV and be sure that you understand each and every term that you have mentioned in it as they might also ask questions from some unrelated projects just to check your confidence and depth of knowledge (happened to a friend and co-intern of mine).\n\nFor the HR interview, you may watch some interview videos on YouTube, or read HR interview questions on Google. It does not need much extra preparation though. In the end, just be yourself!\n\nWhat difficulties did you face while preparing for this Company/Profile? How did you overcome this problem?\n\nI had to study Power Electronics on my own, while also parallelly studying Digital and Analog electronics for other core profiles. I had a little less time as I was involved in a competition for most of my summers. I used GATE books to study the basics of Power Electronics, as well as revise Electrical Machines.\n\nA few more difficulties I faced -\n\nDuring the test, there was a time crunch, and there were almost seventy-five questions to be solved within an hour. There was also negative marking so I had to be cautious while answering the questions.\n\nDuring the HR interview, I faced some network fluctuations but the interviewer was very supportive and ultimately my HR interview was conducted over a phone call.\n\nAccording to you, who should ideally apply for this job?\n\nIf you are interested in core electrical engineering and automotive systems, you should apply for this internship. There are projects given to interns here in Electrical and Mechanical R&D, Manufacturing, Materials, and Engineering Operations (involves robotic automation, embedded systems, AI, etc.) for those of you interested in the core.\n\nAny specific advice you want to give to the junta sitting for internships this year.\n\nWhat are some of the major points you think would be valid to mention in your CV while targeting this profile? (any specific suggestions you would like to make?)\n\nAs mentioned earlier, if you have done any project in core EE or ME, it will be a great value addition to your CV. You can also mention any self-projects that you might have undertaken in the summer."

        "content": "FORESIGHT(2022): Summer Internship at Sprinklr | Nuruddin Jiruwala\n\n--\n\nListen\n\nBrief Introduction\n\nHello junta! My name is Nuruddin Jiruwala, and I just completed my fourth year in Electrical Engineering in its dual degree course. I am interning as a Product Engineer Intern at Sprinklr in the ML team this summer of 2022, which I received via CDC internships 2021\u201322. Appreciate the initiative by SWG to share the experiences of people spread across various fields, helping our beloved KGP community.\n\nHow did you get into Sprinklr? What was the selection procedure?\n\nSo the procedure was divided into two stages broadly\n\nHow to prepare for them?\n\nIf you are a Dual Degree student then it\u2019s good to have multiple projects/at least one internship or both on your resume. As the DSA part goes I tried doing it my way in my first and second years but ended up getting nowhere. So I opted for Algozenith as it was more structured than my way was ever going to be.\n\nFor the ML concepts, do projects/internships. Trust me, you will learn more on the job than any Coursera course. Saying that I did do a few good courses. Other than that read about the algorithms, their logic, where they can be used, their pitfalls, and the mathematics behind them. There are numerous blogs on the internet regarding them. A bit of linear algebra is also necessary for the maths to make sense. As nobody is going to ask how you would import these models in python because even a kid can do that. They will ask about their inner workings which you will have no idea about if you haven\u2019t already read about them in detail. Statquest(a youtube channel) worked great for me to help me understand some of the statistics and the intuition behind many algorithms. Try to learn and practice at least one simple code on all the famous frameworks i.e. Keras, Tensorflow, Pytorch, etc.\n\nOther than that, have good communication skills and confidence as you need those to voice out your opinions to your team as well as your manager. And well, if you don\u2019t speak in interviews then what\u2019s the point of giving them? :P\n\nWhat difficulties did you face while preparing for this Company/Profile? How did you overcome this problem?\n\nI used to get overwhelmed by the sheer amount of material and stuff to be learned that was available on the internet. That used to break my motivation for days. But I figured I will do it at my pace and we\u2019ll see what happens. The thing that helped me most here is having a support group. I was lucky as I had my parents all the way as well as some great friends(who were also preparing for CDC so we were kinda going through it together). My advice here would be to practice and learn consistently, be it at a slow pace initially doesn\u2019t matter and have a few people to whom you can rant at 3 am(Looking at you Mukul :3)\n\nAccording to you, who should ideally apply for this job?\n\nThere are multiple roles in every software company, so your resume should show which specific role you want to go to clearly. Other than that, somebody that loves algorithms and data should definitely apply here, as the work here seems really interesting( I haven\u2019t started yet properly, but just judging from what I have seen until now)\n\n6) Any specific advice you want to give to the junta sitting for internships this year.\n\nThe most important advice here is that after clearing the screening test, your job is more than halfway done. They are here to hire you and you shouldn\u2019t give them any reason not to. Be confident, think loudly, and voice out what you want from the role as well. Try to forget previously messed up interviews as well and focus on the current one, for e.g. I couldn\u2019t solve the easy two-pointer question in my first interview in the first go because I was still mulling over the Microsoft interview I messed up 5 minutes before :P. Other than that, rejections are normal and the CDC process itself depends a lot on your luck. So don\u2019t give up after initial failures and keep the grind going!\n\nWhat are some of the major points you think would be valid to mention in your CV while targeting this profile?(any specific suggestions you would like to make?)\n\nTry to have multiple projects/internships in your resume specific to the profile you want. Not every project needs to be related, I had a core project on my resume too. But it is good to have a few showcasing your past experience, which will prove your interest in the role, and give you some knowledge beforehand(this would help during your internship as well because you will be familiar with the frameworks/things you will be working on). Also, having projects related to the role will help you talk about stuff that you know in and out of, helping you steer the interview to your advantage.\n\nAll the best to all the juniors sitting for internships this year and in the future!"

I am Aman Mishra, a pre-final year undergraduate student at the Department of Industrial and Systems Engineering, IIT Kharagpur. I am from Kolkata. Last year, I received an internship offer in the Software Profile from Honeywell via the CDC internship drive.\n\nHow did you get into Honeywell? What was the selection procedure?\n\nThe first step of the selection procedure was a coding test comprising 2 questions to be solved in 1 hour. The questions were doable if someone had practiced questions thoroughly from InterviewBit. The time of submission was also considered while shortlisting candidates for the next round as many people were able to solve both questions. Students from all the departments were allowed to take the coding test.\n\nThe next step involved technical rounds followed by an HR round. I had to sit through only 1 technical round, whereas some students had to go through 2 technical rounds. The technical round had a couple of coding questions followed by some questions on the OOP concepts and a brief discussion about one of the projects I mentioned on my CV. The last round of the process was the HR round where standard HR questions were asked along with a discussion on projects mentioned on my CV.\n\nHow to prepare for them?\n\nSince the selection process primarily revolves around judging your problem-solving skills and knowledge of Data Structures and Algorithms, it is advisable to practice on the various coding platforms like Codeforces, CodeChef, Atcoder, etc. to sharpen your problem-solving skills and build a temperament to solve problems in a time-bound situation. InterviewBit is a must-do resource since it contains questions like what is asked in the interview rounds. Try giving the CDC Series Contests conducted by Grimoire of Code (GOC) for a good practice of the coding tests.\n\nObject-Oriented Programming Fundamentals, as well as puzzles, are also asked quite often asked in the interview rounds, hence it is recommended to prepare them well. Other than these, one or two weeks before the CDC interviews, start giving mock interviews so that you become well versed in communicating your solution approach clearly to the interviewer.\n\nWhat difficulties did you face while preparing for this Company/Profile? How did you overcome this problem?\n\nA specific issue that I faced was not being able to properly explain the approach of my solution. To overcome this, I took some help from seniors and friends and asked them to take mock interviews which eventually helped me to improve.\n\nAccording to you, who should ideally apply for this job?\n\nAnyone interested in software development.\n\nAny specific advice you want to give to the junta sitting for internships this year.\n\nThe entire process is very taxing so be mentally prepared for it and keep yourself motivated throughout. Make a group of friends who are targeting the same profile as yours and prepare with them. Preparing in a group will keep you motivated as well as ensure that you do not miss important deadlines. Make sure that you have prepared your CV very well and got it reviewed by your seniors. Lastly, accept the fact that rejection is a part of this entire process. So do not lose hope in case you face any rejections, trust the process, keep working hard, and you will eventually sail through it. Just Keep Calm and Keep Coding. Good Luck :)\n\nWhat are some of the major points you think would be valid to mention in your CV while\n\ntargeting this profile? (Any specific suggestions you would like to make?)\n\nTry to mention at least one group project (if you have any) since group projects show that you are a team player and have the skills to collaborate with others to solve any problem. If you have good ranks in coding competitions (like KickStart, Codejam, HackerCup) and good ratings on sites like Codeforces and CodeChef, do mention those in your resume as these ratings and ranks function as a good proxy for your coding skills. Most importantly, do not put anything in your resume that you cannot defend or are not confident about."

I was offered a summer internship as SDE at Honeywell.\n\nSelection procedure\n\nThere are a total of three rounds of the selection process, i.e. the coding round at first obviously, then followed by Technical Round, and at the end HR round.\n\n1.The coding round consists of three questions with medium-level questions (at least one DP) within a time limit of 90 mins if I remember correctly.\n\n2.The technical round questions are a function of the CV of the candidate. The interviewer might ask to code the basics of DS (like Priority Queue, BST) and some popular algorithms (Knapsack, BFS, etc.). Other than that the candidate will be asked a handful of conceptual questions and a tricky puzzle in the end.\n\n3.The last round with HR is rather more relaxing and non-technical. However, HR might be interested in co-curriculums of the candidate and evaluate his/her worth to the company.\n\nHow to prepare for them?\n\nI did appear in CDC with just the right amount of preparations, not more not less. For one month I completely focused on Competitive Programming targeting 4\u20135 questions everyday topic wise. Apart from that my previous projects helped me to make an impression in interview rounds.\n\nYour Project Details\n\nI belonged to a small team of other interns. We built a complete end-to-end product called Asset Health Analyzer backed with ML models that can classify faulty data and predict upcoming data from IoT devices of Assets in various industries. The product consists of a dashboard that allows users to operate and analyze asset statistics.\n\nHow was your experience working from home?What difficulties did you face?\n\nWork from home did have some pros and cons as well. We had flexibility in time slots of work even though we had meetings twice a day. However, we did miss out on the real-time exposure of regular offline internships. We soon got acquainted with the work culture.\n\nApart from the technical level of difficulty, I didn\u2019t encounter any form of hurdle during my tenure.\n\nWhat effect could Covid have in the upcoming internship process?\n\nSpeaking from my point of view, Covid does change the hiring culture of companies in general. Now the hiring staff can just establish a remote video call instead of conducting 24\u00d77 interviews of candidates on campus. This raises a level of uncertainty in the hiring process and adds lots of stray factors.\n\nAccording to you who should ideally apply for this intern\n\nThis company is best known for global-wide services in almost every field. Candidates who love to bring their ideas to life, create solutions to industrial problems, and at the same time expect ethical treatment and respect of personal time, this is the best-suited company for them."

        "content": "FORESIGHT(2021): Summer Internship at American Express | Rishi Jain\n\n--\n\nListen\n\nBrief Introduction\n\nHello to everyone reading this. I am Rishi Jain, a final year undergrad from the Industrial Engineering dept, pursuing its B.tech course. I did my summer internship at American Express as an analyst in the SPG, which basically is an in-house strategy consulting team, part of the global AmEx strategy team.\n\nSelection Procedure\n\nAmEx generally comes on day1 for its intern as well as placement selections.\n\nFor the intern selection procedure, there happens to be an online test, followed by 2 rounds of interviews after shortlisting based on the test scores and CV screening.\n\nOnline Test\n\nThe test comprises 3 sections\n\nThe aptitude ques are of medium difficulty, but given a short time, it\u2019s a challenging exercise to solve even 15+ ques if you are not in practice.\n\nThen comes the ML section \u2014 10 basic questions in 10\u201315 mins; I will just keep it short, stating them as \u201cfairly simple\u201d\n\nThe last section happens to be a business problem. Here, they had a unique way of representing the case, let\u2019s say, by giving you 50 chits of info and allowing you to open up only 40 of them, with each chit labeled what kind of information it contains. So you need to understand what information you need to arrive at a decision for the given case (MCQ-based).\n\nOverall, the level of difficulty lies between medium to hard.\n\nInterviews\n\nFirst-round (CV grilling + knowledge check) \u2014 Every interview starts with an introduction, which should be precise and crisp from our end. I was grilled about my CV and ML/DL knowledge in the first interview. It went pretty well as I was able to defend all elements of CV except some questions around DL and python. One piece of advice for fellow peeps \u2014 It\u2019s okay if you don\u2019t know the answer to a question asked; you must not waste any time or be silent during the interview. Politely inform the interviewer that you are not aware of the topic currently and move on.\n\nThe second round (Case + HR) of the interview was basically a case round followed by a general discussion and cultural-fit conversation. I was asked a case on optimization as I had a couple of projects around it. In my case specifically, I had to formulate the problem into an optimization framework, define the required data points, constraints and finally cover some possible outcomes. They just give you any business problem/scenario, and you are supposed to drive the conversation, ask questions and arrive at a conclusion. I was fortunate that I got asked a case only around my field of expertise.\n\nThere is no defined way to learn data science or whatever you might call this field; one should try to explore according to interests without skipping any basics. I am mentioning very few topics to learn in the vast AI frame, with one particular resource of my choice.\n\nAnalytics can go hand-in-hand while studying ML, and one might switch towards core analytics or proceed towards deep learning.\n\nOne should explore the following topics to make their analytics muscle strong (Practice-based stuff) -\n\nProject Details\n\nWell, the project I did is subject to implementation and potential impact on decisions after further work, so I can\u2019t really disclose my full project details.\n\nBeing a part of the strategy consulting team, I was lucky to have an exciting project around how marketplaces (say Amazon) impacts financial institutions (basically AmEx), with an attempt to identify mitigation strategies for the associated risk.\n\nIt was a fantastic open-ended project with a large scope, but one must know that there is a limitation of data when it comes to any competitive industry.\n\nWFH experience (I would say communication is the key for a fruitful WFH exp)\n\nIn my opinion, growth is capped working from home when compared to working in any corporate office/environment.\n\nBut obviously, everything has its pros/cons, here is what I felt -\n\nCons\n\nPros\n\nImpact of Covid on internship selections (Situation is identical for each one of us, so don\u2019t let any circumstance impact your chances/performance at the end)\n\nThere ain\u2019t going to be as such an impact, the companies are considerably ready and stable for the situation, and with students able to save a lot of time, they can also go for the enormous world of off-campus opportunities and diverse domains.\n\nI don\u2019t see any difficulties coming up to grab an opportunity (on or off campus). There is definitely a hustle, but that helps us remain competitive and learn new skills, pushing every day.\n\nIdeal student match for Amex strategy role\n\nAs the team name suggests (Amex strategy), they offer a strategy consultant kind of role, which involves working with a world-class team of analysts and managers responsible for making strategies, directly impacting where the corporation will stand incoming 3\u20135 years. This opportunity really polishes your pitches, communication, the way you present your work, and refine the way you think about strategies.\n\nOne could get extreme exposure to analytics and insights, helping them shape their ideation and implementation.\n\nAdvice for students sitting this year\n\n(CDC intern won\u2019t define your career)\n\nI want every student to know that bagging a CDC internship (at any day) is good, but it doesn\u2019t matter if you don\u2019t get it through CDC. There is a large sea of opportunities waiting to be exploited off-campus, where you might learn, even more, working under your suitable role. Campus selections don\u2019t offer that much diversity of profiles (for internships only), which one could explore off-campus.\n\nAnd one internship can be a plus point for you, but it can\u2019t define your career.\n\n(Skill development is the key \u2014 whatever your goal might be)\n\nApart from this, I would recommend every fellow kgpian to keep working hard on their skills, not only coding/CP or CDC prep stuff (you must do that), but simultaneously explore new domains, fields you like, or anything that creates a spark of interest amongst you.\n\nAll The Best !"

        "content": "FORESIGHT(2021): Summer Internship at KPIT Technologies Ltd | Keshav Bagri\n\n--\n\nListen\n\nBrief Introduction\n\nI am Keshav Bagri a final year undergraduate student of the Department of Mechanical Engineering enrolled in its 4-year course. I am about to complete my summer internship at KPIT Technologies Ltd. I am also working for the Centre for Automotive Research, The Ohio State University.\n\nSelection Procedure\n\nI received an email from MFTP containing a PDF with a list of projects KPIT was offering this year. This PDF consisted of projects in the domain of electric vehicles, driverless vehicles, ML, Data Science, and Mechanical Engineering. Next, I had to fill a form with my personal details, skills, and 3 projects, in preferential order and provide an innovative solution to the project, if applicable. The first round was essentially based on this form and my CV which was submitted to CDC. The next round was the interview, for which a total of 16 students were shortlisted, for different projects. The interview was based on the conceptual knowledge for the project I had selected in the form, my CV, and basic programming questions. It should be noted that the programming round is subject to the project you have applied for and may or may not be applicable in every case.\n\nHow to prepare for them?\n\nSince there is no test involved, the preparation is completely limited to the interview. For this, I\u2019d recommend that you should be thorough with your CV. More than 75% of my interview was meticulously based on my CV. They even asked questions about the projects/internships which were not connected to the internship project I had applied for. Apart from this, try to gather some information about the projects that you have chosen in the form. Towards the end of the interview, I was asked about my familiarity with the project and how helpful it would be for them. The programming round was something I wasn\u2019t prepared for. I stumbled on a couple of questions but I managed to give the answers for the rest of them, so they seemed to be satisfied with it. In your case, if you think your project may require you to code, then you should prepare for the programming questions, at least to some extent.\n\nProject details\n\nMy project is related to driverless vehicles in general. Title \u2014 \u201cMemory footprint and inference time reduction for Deep Learning models\u201d. Deep learning models, used in driverless vehicles for object detection, motion planning, etc. are computationally extensive in terms of memory requirement and time they take to generate the output. This is a challenging task because the deployment of these models on edge devices like microcontrollers or custom hardware having substantially lesser resources available for computation is difficult, considering the cost and availability of these edge devices. My job was to reduce the complexity of the selected models using open source AI compilers and Deep Learning frameworks and perform a comparative analysis based on the results. Finally, these results will be published in a research article.\n\nHow was your experience working from home? What difficulties did you face?WFH experience isn\u2019t something you would want for your summer internship. The recruiters tried their best to arrange for offline interaction. Nevertheless, the situation didn\u2019t allow for one. I didn\u2019t face any difficulty as such since I had good internet connectivity and my mentors were very helpful in resolving the issues I encountered throughout the internship. Overall, as far as learning is concerned, this experience was fruitful since I got to know a lot about things, I wasn\u2019t very familiar with.\n\nWhat effect could COVID have in the upcoming internship process?\n\nThe present situation is very similar to that of the last year, with the only difference being in the timeline. If you are interested in the core sector, you might encounter some hurdles because of intense competition, but then again, uncertainties and challenges are a part of life. You don\u2019t have any choice but to navigate through these obstacles and make the best out of this internship experience. You may feel good after getting a day-1 or day-2 internship, but in the long run, honestly, it doesn\u2019t matter. Your efforts and the experience you gain from this endeavor, are the only things that you should focus on. Patience is something which you must have during the entire season; I learnt this in a difficult way ;)\n\nAccording to you, who should ideally apply for this internship?\n\nIf you are interested in the automotive domain, then you should definitely apply for this internship. KPIT works extensively in the domain of automotive engineering, encompassing its various areas. Also, they offer projects in multiple areas as I mentioned earlier, which can be appealing.\n\nAnd what advice will you give to them?\n\n:: Conceptual understanding of the projects that you have worked on prior to the interview, and details related to the project you are applying for, will surely make you stand out of the crowd. For instance, even though I wasn\u2019t very confident during the programming round, my CV and understanding of the projects I had worked on, was something that they actually liked.\n\nNow, since the CV preparation on ERP is over, the best you can do is to prepare well for the interview. All the best!!\n\n\u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014\n\nSome of the blogs which might be helpful:\n\n1. CDC Internship Diary \u2014 KPIT Technologies Ltd.\n\n2.

I started exploring the field of machine learning and deeplearning in the month of March 2020 during the quarantineperiod and was very intrigued by it. I got the data science intern opportunity at Microsoft through the on campus CDC drive last year.\n\nSelection procedure\n\nThere was a screening test of 1 hour duration containing 50 MCQs from topics like Machine Learning concepts and algorithms, deeplearning and statistics. The interview round consisted of two technical rounds and the last technical round itself consisted of a few HR questions towards the end. Questions related to DSA, ML and probability were asked in the technical rounds.\n\nHow to prepare for them?\n\nReading blogs from sites such as \u201ctowardsdatascience\u201d, \u201canalyticsvidya\u201d , and watching videos from various sources like \u201cStatQuest\u201d, \u201cNPTEL\u201d, \u201cStanford Distance Learning\u201d, really helps in having your concepts cleared with proper understanding of algorithms and the clear visualisation of their working.\n\nApart from that, practicing on problem statements from kaggle gives you confidence. More focus should be put on data preprocessing and feature engineering as in real life and also during the internship period you\u2019ll have to deal with raw data. Therefore data preprocessing and feature engineering becomes as important as model designing and training.\n\nIn the internship period you would be dealing with very huge data and most of the things would be performed on cloud. Thus having an idea of cloud services like AWS and Azure is really helpful.\n\nYour Project Details\n\nMy project was on \u201cMultivariate Time Series Anomaly Detection\u201d.\n\nHow was your experience working from home? What difficulties did you face?\n\nIt wasn\u2019t that much of a problem for me as the team members were continuously connected through MS teams and my mentor was very approachable and helpful throughout the internship period.\n\nHowever it would have been much more fun and it would have been easier to connect and interact had it been an offline internship.\n\nWhat effect could COVID have in the upcoming internship process?\n\nFor Microsoft, I believe there\u2019s no particular effect of Covid. The University Recruitment team is very helpful and the internship process would be very smooth right from the onboarding.\n\nWho should ideally apply for this internship?\n\nAnyone with interest in Data Science and having considerable knowledge in the field of ML/DL with a decent level of coding skills can apply.\n\nWhat advice will you give to them?\n\nJust have your concepts clear, focus more on learning and increasing your knowledge base in the first two years of college rather than running behind projects/internships just for the sake of mentioning them in your Resume. Target reasonable projects and internships which provide you a good opportunity to learn."

I am a fourth-year undergraduate student of the department of Electrical Engineering enrolled in its Instrumentation Engineering course. I have done my summer internship in 2021 at Bajaj Auto in its R&D EE department.\n\nSelection Procedure\n\nThe selection procedure consisted of an MCQ test with questions divided into 4 sections: Aptitude, Quant, Vocabulary & Technical. The test was followed by a shortlisting based on the test and your CV.\n\nFinally, there were 2 technical interview rounds and 1 HR round.\n\nHow to prepare for them?\n\nRevision of your coursework, majorly Machines & Power Electronics, is sufficient to prepare for the test and the first technical round. The second technical round needs you to be thorough with your CV and your projects. You should know each aspect of your project even if some other teammate is working on it. The HR round, as mentioned earlier, does not require more than a few google searches to get familiar with the common HR questions and to know a bit about the company.\n\nYour Project Details\n\nSince I am interning with the Research & Development team, my work was very much on the electrical aspects of the vehicle itself. My work was on an ISG \u2014 Integrated Starter Generator (interested people can search it on the net). I would suffice it to say that the work was exciting and you could see the direct application of your work on the vehicle. The result was majorly on Simulink, so previous knowledge of the same was beneficial in my case.\n\nHow was your experience working from home? What difficulties did you face?\n\nI indeed wanted to get a bit of corporate experience, which I could not, but the mentor ensured that I had enough work all the time. If the internship had been on site, I would indeed have gotten the chance to implement my design on a prototype but the online nature of the internship limited me to just computer simulations which was a bummer. It would surely have been more enriching if I had interacted with the officials there and with the other interns.\n\nWhat effect could Covid have in the upcoming internship process?\n\nBajaj Auto did call a few interns on-site based on their project requirement so there is a high possibility of having the upcoming internships offline. But the CDC process is still online. There would surely be people resorting to malpractices in the test. In some questions, you might not be able to convey your ideas as effectively as you would have been face-to-face, so you should indeed work upon your communication skills. Other than that, try to be off social media for a few days to avoid distractions and unnecessary demotivation.\n\nAccording to you, who should ideally apply for this intern?\n\nPeople who are heavily inclined towards the Electrical core profile and Electrical systems design are well suited for the internship in Bajaj Auto. You are not expected to know everything at the beginning of your training but should have a will to learn quickly and apply it to the problem at hand.\n\nAnd what advice would you give them?\n\nTry to deliver a bit more than asked for and also try to take the initiative on your internship.\n\nAnd in general for everybody -\n\nTry to be thorough with your CV\n\nStick to the profile you want to pursue ahead in your career. Don\u2019t go for a profile just because its internship is easy to bag.\n\nCDC is not the end. There are loads of opportunities in each profile so do not hesitate to apply for off-campus foreign research internships.\n\nLast but not the least, try to stay in touch with a senior who has done his/her internship at a place you want to.\n\nBest of Luck,\n\nSwarnim Raj\n\nPS: Do not hesitate to contact me in case of any doubts"

I\u2019m pursuing a Chemical Engineering core internship in Piramal Pharma Solutions. I watch films and solve equations.\n\nSelection procedure\n\nPiramal selection procedure takes place in 4 steps. I\u2019ll give each filtration stage\u2019s number corresponding to my scenario, but those might not repeat this year.\n\nThis entire process (all the above four steps) took place in the 2nd week of the internship.\n\nHow to prepare for them?\n\nYour Project Details\n\nGenerally, many companies make you sign a non-disclosure agreement, so we shouldn\u2019t give details technically. But to put it short for insight, I was given all the data of an existing boiler and asked to increase its efficiency and optimize all bottleneck costs. Most of the weeks went with the Chemical Engineering-based knowledge of Heat Transfer; however, a bit of Capital Budgeting concepts and documentation was required towards the end of the project.\n\nNOTE: There were 11 interns from 4 IITs, and all of us were allotted different Piramal sites, and the projects assigned were also completely different from each other. Many of them have got Supply Chain and Logistics profile projects too.\n\nHow was your experience working from home? What difficulties did you face?\n\nIt went pretty impressive because they allotted the project considering its WFH feasibility. Also, the internship isn\u2019t only about the project; every week, we had 1\u20132 sessions from Global leaders of Piramal on various topics such as Design Thinking, Quality culture, Formulations, etc. We miss going on-site and working with hands-on core projects, but they designed the program to compensate for the lack of on-site presence. Also, on a particular need basis, some of us are permitted to go on-site for a week. So, at least after habituation with 2 Online semesters, there weren\u2019t difficulties; attending meetings and utilizing platforms for sharing data felt seamless.\n\nWhat effect could Covid have in the upcoming internship process?\n\nI don\u2019t think there would be an effect on conducting the internship season, as it went organized during my time even with COVID. However, when it comes to the stakes of each individual, then, unfortunately, there are a lot of problems ranging from internet issues to inadequate mental health balance. But it has been more than a year since the pandemic, and everyone is striving against their critical points. So, I wish the pre-final years would also be in a position to pass the upcoming phase. Reach out to your friends in need.\n\nAccording to you, who should ideally apply for this internship?\n\nAny potential Chemical Engineering student with a genuine interest in either core ChE or Supply Chain profiles should give their best try.\n\nAnd what advice will you give to them?\n\nSharpen your presentation skills, be concise about what you explain, and make the interviewer understand each point you\u2019re speaking. Spend time on the topics/courses/internships/projects/competitions you have more grasp on and smartly skip the topics of ambiguity during the interview. Start making it a discussion right after your introduction, take cues from the interviewer, give pauses, and be pleasant. Balance being intuitive yet professional. Also, Piramal usually maintained a consistent style in the pattern of interview questions across the IITs, so if you have friends in other IITs to get information from, then contact them before your interview day.\n\nIt\u2019s going to be fun, and it\u2019s going to be alright, Peace!\n\nNot many can keep their sane state of mind during the internship drive, and if you could master that one bit by making rational decisions whenever needed, you\u2019ll be already halfway through it.

In the 2020 CDC internship drive, I received a Research Internship in Adobe Big Data Lab for nearly 13 weeks.\n\nSelection Procedure :\n\nThe selection was divided into two steps :\n\na. Written Test: Medium level Questions on Data Structure And Algorithm, Probability and Statistics, Some direct questions from 50 challenges in Probability and few other basic questions on OOPS, DBMS\n\nb.Interview Round: Selected students had to further appear for a 1-hour long interview round where detailed discussions on projects mentioned in the resume were discussed. The exact working of some machine learning and deep learning algorithms were asked.\n\nFor me specifically, many questions were related to the language model (maybe because most of my work till then was on NLP). Also, 2 basic level questions from array and time complexity optimization were asked. This was the final round.\n\nc.Practicing questions from Interview bit, geeks for geeks,50 challenges in probability would suffice.

During the beginning of my project, we were given only the term Topological Data Analysis. From building the problem statement to the solution, all were based on interns\u2019 thought processes and decisions.\n\nHow was your experience working from home?\n\nI would not like to term it tricky because Adobe ensured that we have the best experience ever in the online version, but brainstorming ideas and discussion on the whiteboard would have been better than using a virtual Microsoft whiteboard.\n\nWhat effect could Covid have in the upcoming internship process?\n\nAs the internship process has already started and I see the same company and profiles coming for the CDC internship last year, I don\u2019t know the effect of covid there but the number of interns selected and PPO offered might be reduced due to covid for some companies.\n\nAccording to you, who should ideally apply for this internship?\n\nAnyone who has a keen interest in machine learning and deep learning and wants to innovate something in this field must apply for the internship.\n\nWhat advice will you give to them?\n\nFor an interview, be very thorough with Machine Learning and Deep Learning Algorithms, Optimization Algorithms, Evaluation metrics. In general, I would advise everyone to be patient as this entire process of securing an internship can be overwhelming at times. Maybe you don\u2019t guarantee training in Day1/Day2 or the company you desire, but don\u2019t let this stop you from giving your best. Eventually, things will fall in place."

        "content": "IITFORESIGHT(2021): Summer Internship at Micron Technology | Rohit\n\n--\n\nListen\n\nBrief Introduction\n\nHi, I am Rohit. I am a final year UG student of the Department of Electrical Engineering enrolled in its B.Tech course. I have completed my summer internship as a Design Verification Intern at Micron Technology.\n\nSelection procedure\n\nFirst, we had a CV shortlisting round, then there was around 1 hour of written test MCQ-type questions on Aptitude, Analog, Digital, and Verilog. They gave a dedicated time slot to each part. The test was of moderate level and most of the problems were easy. They selected 18 guys for the interview.\n\nThere was only a technical round, no HR round. I had my interview for around 40\u201345 minutes. After A few minutes, he asked me a few questions from my CV and asked me to explain a few points I mentioned in my CV. Later he started asking technical questions. Technical questions were from Analog and Digital, most of the questions were easy, from basic kmap minimization, CMOS inverters, Transistor level circuits, logic gates, diodes circuits, BJTs, and all. I believe he was trying to test my basics of Analog and Digital. Finally, they selected 3 of us for the internship.\n\nHow to prepare for them?\n\nI would rate both the test and interview as moderate level. One should be strong with the basics of Analog and Digital. Analog and Digital both are depth courses for us so try to perform well in these and go through whatever your professor teaches you. For Analog one can go through Behzad Razavi\u2019s ( book + video lectures).\n\nFor digital since it was in 5th sem for us I have gone through Digital Electronics Circuits on NPTEL by Prof. Goutam Saha and Neso Academy\u2019s Digital Electronics videos over youtube. Book I will suggest Morris Mano for practice. Most of the core tests are MCQ type so one can also solve GATE questions for practice.\n\nThe cutoff for core profiles is around 8\u20138.5. So to qualify for their written exam, one must satisfy CG cutoff. A CGPA of 8+ is good enough. Most of the core companies look for people with a good understanding of concepts, I repeat have a good understanding of concepts and practice problems as much as you can.\n\nYour Project Details\n\nThere was a 3 week training period entirely based on core subjects. We went through the whole DRAM circuits understanding the working principle and design, getting familiar with Cadence Virtuoso, Verilog, Finesim, and other basic materials required to start the project.\n\nThe training period was really good. We were exposed to a lot of things within a short period of time. My profile was Design Verification so we have to automate the verification flows of our design. I have to develop python scripts to check for finesim waveforms for various test modes. I know it may not sound core-oriented but along with python scripts I have to do a visual check of waveforms and compare the results with the script I wrote.\n\nMy main purpose was to automate the waveform measurements using python scripts. Since it was just an 8-week internship they gave us a few test modes so that I can get familiar with working on test modes. Normally full-time employees work more on core related things.\n\nHow was your experience working from home? What difficulties did you face?\n\nIt was an 8-week long internship starting from 10th May to 5th July. My experience working from home was good but we all know working remotely can\u2019t match with on-site work. But my mentor, manager, and colleagues all were very friendly, helpful, and supportive.\n\nThey made my internship much better than I expected. Although there are some pros and cons of working from home. Talking about pros, you can adjust your working hours and lifestyle easily, better productivity, and be safer at home in these tough times. While we miss going to the office, making new friends, talking to employees informally, You don\u2019t get to know your team very closely. I feel the on-site experience is a whole different experience but the internship was conducted so nicely remotely as well.\n\nWhat effect could Covid have in the upcoming internship process?\n\nCovid was there last year as well. We had our whole internship process online and I guess things will get better this time than last year in terms of conducting the internship process online. The major problem covid is creating is connectivity, so stay connected with your friends and seniors, don\u2019t lose hope, things will go right.\n\nAccording to you, who should ideally apply for this internship?\n\nMicron is a semiconductor company. Those who are interested in core electronics and want to pursue a career in the same should apply at Micron.\n\nWhat advice will you give to them?\n\nThere are relatively fewer opportunities to get an internship in the core because of the large strength of EC+EE and less number of core companies coming for internships. Don\u2019t restrict yourself to a single profile, at least try to give tests for each profile. Don\u2019t completely rely on core, also have some backup for software profiles too. In software, knowledge of Data Structures and Algorithms would be enough.\n\nI would recommend following the JKR funda page as he provides most of the core related materials and fundae. Also, be in touch with the seniors, we are more than happy to help you. Lastly, I would say don\u2019t worry much about internships, placements. There are a lot of opportunities ahead. Even if you don\u2019t get internships through CDC you can always apply off-campus. Appear for GATE exam, apply in PSUs, etc.\n\nAll the best."

I interned at Optum, a part of UnitedHealthcare Group, during the summers of 2021. I worked with the Clinical Quality Analytics team under the profile of Product Management.\n\nSelection Procedure:\n\n2020 was the first year when Optum came for a product management role in Engineering Schools. They usually hired PM interns from Business Schools in India. The selection process is more involved than other profiles.\n\nThe initial screening was based on CV shortlisting and CGPA. The shortlisted students were then interviewed.\n\nAll the interviews take place on the same day and overall the entire interview process takes around 3\u20134 hours. Finally, 2 people were selected for the product management profile.\n\nHow to prepare for them:\n\nHaving Projects, Internships, or domain knowledge of Machine learning and Deep learning will be very helpful as the company solutions are themselves based on AI. Be very thorough with what you have in your CV, and practice guesstimates can come in handy. If you have time, do look for some business points for your internships/projects. Be familiar with standard HR and personality-based questions.\n\nYour Project Details:\n\nMy project was to create a machine learning-based solution that will generate target strategies for Health Plan managers in the US. Because the market was already identified by work mainly on the technical and UI part of the product, i.e., creating the predictive model and integrating it to a website. This was then benchmarked as the minimum viable product. Other than these, I completed some team automation for reading patient-level data, comparing huge chunks of healthcare data, etc.\n\nHow was your experience working from home? What difficulties did you face?\n\nI didn\u2019t have any issues with the internship being remote, overall I\u2019d say I had a very fruitful time interning with Optum. My mentor and manager were both friendly and we used to have daily meetings for the project much like a scrum call. The only challenges I faced were when I had power cuts or internet shutdowns because of maintenance but it\u2019s a part of a remote setup.\n\nWhat effect could COVID have in the upcoming internship process?\n\nI think that after the 2020 and 2021 internships, most of the companies have accepted the current state in which we are. So that\u2019s a bright side to look at. If the pandemic situation resolves out well till next year some companies may have on-site internships too. Be regularly updated with all the notices from CDC.\n\nAccording to you, who should ideally apply for this internship?\n\nYou don\u2019t need to have prior knowledge of the US Healthcare system or product management. Ideally, it will improve your chances if you have some projects in AI or AI for Healthcare. Having a case study competition on your cv can also be helpful. If you have worked on AI and have a keen interest in business strategy, this role would be perfect. Any product management company having domain knowledge of their signature, After,, and overall products always helps.\n\nAnd what advice will you give to them?\n\nBe calm and be patient for your chance. Shortlist your prioritized companies beforehand and start preparing for them. Get in touch with seniors who are working there or have interned there. The CDC internship process can be very stressful but make sure you learn as much as you can from it.\n\nAll the best :)"

I did my internship with OYO as a Business Analyst Intern in summer 2021. I was selected for the role as a part of their on-campus recruitment program \u2018OYO HEADSTART.\u2019\n\nSelection Procedure\n\nOYO came to campus in the first week of November and was open for all the departments. Out of all the applicants, a total of 305 students got shortlisted for the online test, which had questions in the form of MCQs on aptitude, basics of Data Science and Machine Learning, probability, and statistics, and had 3 questions on SQL where we were asked to write down SQL queries based on schema diagram.\n\nBased on online test scores, they had shortlisted 36 students for the Group Discussion round. There were 4 panels, each consisting of 9 students, and the topic of the Group Discussion was general, not a technical group discussion.\n\nAfter the Group Discussion round, 16 students were shortlisted for the personal interviews. They asked a case study and a few HR questions to wrap it up in the personal interview.\n\nFinally, 8 students got the offer letter.\n\nHow to prepare for them?\n\nFamiliarize yourself with SQL query writing from tabular database formats and schema diagrams. You can refer to w3schools.com or sqlbolt.com for practice. Read about the basics of Data Science and Machine Learning concepts and practice questions on probability and statistics.\n\nYour Project Details\n\nI was assigned a multi-function project with the conversion and growth team at OYO, where I improved the average lifetime ratings of OYO on the Google Play Store and the Apple App Store. I worked on analyzing the problems, designing and implementing new rating and review strategies leading to significant growth in OYO app views, and increasing the number of ratings and reviews on stores. I got a chance to learn and use tools like Google Analytics, Hive Databases, MoEngage, Big Query, Google Play console, and a few more.\n\nHow was your experience working from home? What difficulties did you face?\n\nOverall it was a good experience. OYO implemented 4 working days a week policy for May because of the uprising in the covid cases. Although the office environment was missing, everyone in the organization was easily reachable and available whenever in need. The mentors and senior authorities were very supportive and helpful and contributed a lot to learning and implementing new things.\n\nWhat effect could Covid have on the upcoming internship process?\n\nThe campus isn\u2019t opening soon, and the upcoming internship process would be carried out in the same online manner as last year. Organizations have pretty well adapted to this online medium and the work-from-home environment, so be prepared. There will be many companies coming and recruiting, and don\u2019t lose hope if you cannot secure an offer in the initial days. There are many opportunities available off-campus as well. Keep an eye on them, and all the best!\n\nAccording to you, who should ideally apply for this internship?\n\nIf you\u2019re interested in working with a fast-paced and growing organization where you have an opportunity to own and deliver end-to-end projects, this is one of the best places available.\n\nParting advice\n\nWork on communication and soft skills and be clear with what you want to accomplish in the coming years. Don\u2019t apply for companies just to get a CDC internship."

        "content": "K FORESIGHT(2021): Summer Internship at Qualcomm | Ankur Mishra\n\n--\n\nListen\n\nBrief Introduction\n\nHello, everyone. I am Ankur Mishra, a Final Year Undergraduate student from the Department of Electronics and Electrical Communication Engineering, enrolled in its B. Tech program. I have completed my internship at Qualcomm in Summer 2021 as a Hardware Engineering Intern. I was selected through their on-campus recruitment drive.\n\nSelection procedure\n\nThe selection procedure for Qualcomm in Hardware Engineering profile consists of a written test followed by a Technical Interview and an HR interview. It is pretty much the same for all other core companies. The written test (MCQ) was conducted on the HirePro platform (Audio and Video proctored).\n\nFor the Hardware Engineering profile of Qualcomm, the most important topic is digital electronics (combinational and sequential circuits, CMOS logic).\n\nMost of the questions are from digital electronics and a few advanced topics like static timing analysis and fundamental computer architecture concepts like pipelining, caches, etc.\n\nThere are also some basic coding questions based on the Programming and Data Structures course taught in the first year.\n\nThere is also an aptitude section. The questions are generally not difficult for Qualcomm but require some practice.\n\nThe technical interview was of about 30 minutes. At first, various things were written in my CV like what you did in the Electrical vehicle Group, what is UART, SPI protocol (I had written them in my CV), what is css, etc.\n\nFrom there on, we moved to the digital electronics part. I was asked to draw some counters; Can flip-flop be used as Not gate? Etc. I had written in my CV that I know basic Verilog, so he asked me to write a code for D flip-flop, which is easy.\n\nThen a fundamental programming question was asked to swap numbers stored in two variables without using a third variable. I was also asked to draw a circuit from given timing diagram. Between these some riddles were also asked like river crossing problems etc.\n\nI was asked basic conceptual and analytical questions on various combinational and sequential circuits. They also take a lot of follow-up questions based on a question and try to test your understanding.\n\nAlso, they keep helping you to reach the answer. I felt it\u2019s okay if we can\u2019t answer all the problems but try to solve all the riddles and most of the digital electronics problems for the selection. The HR interview was only for 5 minutes and was just a formality. The interviewer only asked me about relocation constraints and asked me about which specific team I would like to join, of which I had no idea, so I said any team would be fine.\n\nHow to prepare for them?\n\nPreparing for the core profile is more manageable because most things are either taught or taught in the coursework itself. Analog Electronics required for analog profile is covered in the second year itself, but Digital Electronics is not. So, for Digital Profile, we are primarily on our own. For Basics of Digital Electronics, this course on Nptel by one of our professors is quite good: https://nptel.ac.in/courses/108/105/108105132/.\n\nThe playlist by Neso academy on Digital Electronics is also good. I would suggest completing both of them for basics.\n\nTo learn about Static Timing Analysis this website, I found helpful:\n\nhttp://www.vlsi-expert.com/2011/03/static-timing-analysis-sta-basic-timing.html?m=1\n\nThis Playlist is I found helpful if you want to start with Computer Architecture:\n\nhttps://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLxCzCOWd7aiHMonh3G6QNKq53C6oNXGrX\n\nVerilog can refer to various websites and take up a self-project to code some circuits. Also, Courses are available on Coursera, which can teach VHDL and Verilog.\n\nYour Project Details\n\nI interned with the Design Verification team of one of the subsystems of Qualcomm chips. I had two different assignments during the internship; one was to automate the Memory pin connectivity verification flows, and the other was to develop a memory retention state logger. So, for some critical pins of the Memory, we followed a hard-coded approach for the connectivity verification, and various issues were coming in that approach.\n\nSo, my task was to automate this flow and develop a script that takes data from the memory team and generates system Verilog files which can be directly tested in Formal and simulation flow. For the second task, I had to develop a logger which tells us about the retention state o memory in real-time flow. I completed my project within ten weeks, and I also submitted a paper to Qualcomm internal conference. The project was entirely done using System Verilog and Python. I knew Verilog, but I was not familiar with OOP and UVM concepts, so I learned these on the go. I was also unfamiliar with Python scripting and file handling packages and spent almost 1\u20132 weeks developing the concepts.\n\nHow was your experience working from home? What difficulties did you face?\n\nWork from home is never a choice as compared to onsite working. Due to WFH, we couldn\u2019t meet members of other teams and get to know what other groups are doing. We were mostly limited to our work. Also, it was difficult to bond with my other team members as we were allotted Virtual Desks on which video call was not an option, so I never got to see any of my teammates. Nevertheless, HR tried to keep us engaged with several fun events and sessions. Various Goodies were also provided before Joining. Work culture is good at Qualcomm. Everybody is beneficial, and you can approach anyone irrespective of his position and clear\n\nyour doubts. We are also facing a shortage of chips worldwide these days, so many projects are going on parallel, and everybody is extremely busy. However, my manager and mentor, and other teammates were still available for call whenever I needed.\n\nWhat effect could Covid have in the upcoming internship process?\n\nSimilar to last year, this year also we will have an online selection process due to covid. It becomes a problem for some students who don\u2019t have proper resources like good internet connectivity. But we can hope that the Internship will be onsite. Also, seniors are not there to personally guide them, and they also cannot interact physically with their batchmates and know how they are preparing.\n\nWho should ideally apply for this intern?\n\nPeople who are genuinely found themselves interested in Hardware should apply for this role. Those who didn\u2019t get a chance of getting exposed to Hardware through various Research groups in KGP and found core subjects interesting can also apply. The problem is you may not be interning with the team you wanted because they allot randomly, but you will learn a lot by interning at Qualcomm.\n\nWhat advice will you give to them?\n\nThere are very few companies that come for core profiles compared to software ones, and it causes self-doubts like whether we are doing the right thing by preparing for the core. But if we prepare well, we can easily get selected because competition is also lesser.\n\nAlways find a senior who has already interned in these companies because a mentor is significant during this process as it sometimes becomes depressing. Hence having someone to talk to and get the proper guidance regarding preparation material and strategies is substantial. It is always good to find your interests as early as possible, but even if you don\u2019t, don\u2019t get pressured by it.\n\nIf you find yourself interested in the core, start preparing by taking up the recommended materials, prepare a good CV, and get it reviewed. Before the written test, you should go through the previous year\u2019s question papers for that company.\n\nFew things to keep in mind regarding interviews:\n\n1) the Interviewer also tests the approach and your thought process apart from your final answer. So, keep talking to him about what you think can be the way up to the solution.\n\n2) Prepare your CV well and don\u2019t write anything you are unsure about.\n\n3) You can always ask for hints whenever you are stuck. He is always there for help but to a limited extent.\n\n4) Be ready for the interviews even when the shortlist is not out because there is not much time between Shortlist and Interviews. To conclude, I would say don\u2019t take unnecessary pressure and keep calm and patient during the process. Always remember there will be many opportunities, and don\u2019t lose hope if you face rejections.\n\nAll the best,\n\nAnkur Mishra!"

During the CDC Internship drive in 2020\u20132021, I had secured an Internship at Credit Suisse in a Quantitative Analyst role.\n\nSELECTION PROCEDURE :\n\nThe selection procedure for Credit Suisse at CDC majorly involved of 3 rounds:\n\nHOW TO PREPARE:\n\nPreparation for a quant role majorly includes strong fundamentals in probability & statistics, problem solving skills and basics of coding. Thus, the major resources that are available for this preparation for CDC include:\n\nPROJECT DETAILS :\n\nThe internship involved working on a real life project surrounded around building a Quantitative prediction model using a framework called Copulas. The model was built using python and then tested for various different forms of time series dataset.\n\nHow was your experience working from Home & difficulties?\n\nWork from Home during an Internship was an average experience. The reason to say that is because there are a lot of experiences and learning/ networking opportunities that are missed working online. Though there were steps taken by the company to overcome such problems faced by interns, it would always have been better to work on-site.\n\nAt a WFH internship, Skype calls become a common thing and helping out/ getting help from senior people becomes a challenging task. Thus, during this period, staying connected with your manager and being trustworthy/ accountable is one of the most important traits.\n\nEFFECT OF COVID ON UPCOMING INTERNSHIPS:\n\nSince the online internship drive is already conducted by CDC once, you can expect this year to be a bit less hectic and smooth compared to last one. But the basic facts remain the same:\n\n2.More Malpractices during online tests\n\n3.Everyone should keep their Internet connection and Laptops/Desktops updated\n\nOn a better side, due to online semesters and classes, the academic load is expected to be less compared to non-covid years.\n\nWHO SHOULD IDEALLY APPLY FOR THIS INTERNSHIP ?\n\nAny person who is interested in Finance and Statistics can apply for this role. The role is mostly focused on analytical thinking and it\u2019s application to develop financial models.

I am a final year BTech Student from the Department of Electronics and Electrical Communications Engineering, IIT Kharagpur. I am doing my internship at Nvidia this summer 2021. I got the internship offer from Nvidia through the on-campus CDC Internship drive.\n\nSelection Procedure:\n\nThe selection procedure for Nvidia consisted of two stages \u2014 online test followed by interviews. Nvidia had a CG Criteria of 9 for sitting in the tests (which was later reduced to 8.5, I think).\n\nThe online shortlisting test was divided into 3 sections. The 1st section had MCQ questions related to Digital Electronics (Combinatorial and Sequential circuits), CMOS and design and timing analysis of FSMs. The 2nd section was logical reasoning. The 3rd section had lots of Fill in the Blanks related to Computer Architecture and 1 easy coding question.\n\nAfter shortlisting, there was a single round of interview, in which I was asked about my projects I had mentioned in my CV. After that, I was asked technical questions related to Interrupts, Digital Design, Pipelining and Data Hazards. I was also asked an aptitude question. It is important to be clear on fundamentals.\n\nHow to prepare for them?\n\nKnowledge on Digital Electronics and Computer Architecture is important. There are many resources available on Youtube. I recommend the lecture series on Prof. Onur Mutlu\u2019s Youtube channel. You don\u2019t need to understand all of them, but at least you should be familiar with topics upto (and including) Pipelining, Caches and Memory hierarchy. MIT OCW is another good resource for these topics. You can also refer to NPTEL Lectures. For aptitude questions, you can practice from the Heard on the Street book. You should also know the basics of CP and how to use STL data structures for the coding question. You should also check out the JKR funda page on FB for many additional resources.\n\nYour project details:\n\nMy work involved the use of Formal Verification to verify digital designs. Verification is the process of verifying that a design works as expected under all conditions. There are many different forms of verification, formal verification is one of them. It is not a prerequisite to know about verification, you will learn about it after you join.\n\nHow was your experience working from home?\n\nIt was a very good experience working from home. I did not face any technical difficulties. I had regular meetings with my manager, mentor and fellow team members, and I was helped by them a lot. There are no fixed working hours, and it was up to me when I wanted to work, as long as I completed my tasks. There were many interactive sessions organized as well. I was also sent some goodies :)\n\nEffect of Covid on upcoming internship process?\n\nSince this year also, the process is happening online, you may feel alone sitting for so many tests and interviews. Try to form a small group of friends with whom you can discuss. Also since it is online, you may have trouble expressing your thoughts to the interviewer, so make sure to keep thinking out loud during the process. Keep a working webcam and stable net connection.\n\nWho should apply for this internship?\n\nStudents looking to build a career in core electronics and interested in learning more about how big designs work should definitely apply. There is a lot of scope to learn a lot of new skills. You could also get software related projects after joining depending on your CV and interests.\n\nWhat advice will you give them?\n\nAs I mentioned earlier, it is important to let the interviewer know what you are thinking. The number of companies coming for core internships is comparatively limited compared to non-core companies, so don\u2019t get demotivated if some of your friends get internships before you. Keep a calm mind during tests and be clear on the fundamentals. Keep in touch with placecomms during the day of interviews and communicate your priority order to them. You should also read up a bit on the latest news and products of the company you are interviewing for."

I completed my internship(SDE role) at Amazon Development Centre, Bangalore, this summer.\n\nI applied for Software Development and Analyst role both. The Selection procedure includes shortlisting( for some companies), then a screening test followed by an interview.\n\nSelection Procedure :\n\nAll the companies ask coding questions in the screening test. In addition, for analyst profile questions from Mathematics(probability and algebra), Machine Learning, Logical Ability, Data Interpretation, and Comprehensive English were asked. Particularly to say about Amazon, it was open to circuital branch, and the screening test consisted of 4 sections -\n\na. Code Debug (20 minutes) \u2014 Finding bugs in 7 pieces of code.\n\nb. Coding test (70 minutes) \u2014 Solving 2 problems.\n\nc. Work Styles Assessment (10\u201315 minutes) \u2014 In this section, you will be asked to choose to what extent a provided statement represents your work style.\n\nd. Logical Ability(35 minutes) \u2014 You will be asked a series of problem-solving MCQs.\n\nAmazon shortlisted 34 for an interview.\n\nI was shortlisted for Honeywell(Software research) and Oracle(SDE). At Honeywell, the interviewer told me to introduce myself at first. Then he asked about my project and a few questions \u2014 1 probability( rolling the bullet), 2 puzzles( 3 switches and 3 bulbs, Mislabelled 3 baskets), and 2 coding problems( 1 from DP). The interview went well but I did not get any call for the HR round. In Oracle, I was asked questions from LinkedList, but the interview was not satisfactory.\n\nOn Day3 though I was shortlisted for Amazon, WellsFargo, MasterCard, and Huawei, I sat for the first 3. The day started with the interview in Wells Fargo. The interviewer asked about my project and then asked if I am comfortable with Computer Networks and Operating systems. I replied the subjects would be taught in the 6th semester. Then he moved to the coding questions. A couple of hours later, my turn came for the interview in Amazon. I was asked to introduce myself. He asked a bit about my project and then moved to the code part. I was asked a question based on graph and search. I first came up with a naive solution and told it. He then asked me to optimize it in terms of time and memory. I took the help of Map container and told the approach to the interviewer. He seemed to be not satisfied with the solution at first from a complexity point. I then told him the complexity analysis. After that, he told me to write the code in the editor(syntactically correct). Finally, I was told if I had any questions about Amazon on which I asked about the work culture and the kind of work that is done there. As soon as I completed my Amazon interview I sat for MasterCard. The initial part of the conversation was almost the same as other companies. Then I was asked some questions (1 from DP) and I had to write the code of the DP. The interview for MasterCard went well.\n\nJust after the interview with MasterCard, I got confirmation of my selection by Amazon.No further round was there. Amazon is a big company and due to the quality of work there I immediately accepted the offer.\n\nAlgo \u2014 This first thing that is needed is \u2014 be thorough with the concepts of Algorithm (especially Linked List, Graph and Search, Tree, Dynamic Programming, and DP).\n\nHow to prepare for them?\n\nI had algorithms in my 3rd semester as a core subject. In the winter after the 3rd semester, I practiced some DP questions from geeks for geeks. When the lockdown started in March 2020 I started with InterviewBit topic-wise and took the help of the solution there when I got stuck. In May I postponed InterviewBit and revised the concepts of the algorithm from Cormen. Then as the day of screening tests got closer I again started doing random questions from important topics in InterviewBit. Before interview days I read some company-specific blogs of interviews from geeks for geeks and looked through company-specific questions accordingly.\n\nTo practice some mixed bag of questions, leetcode is also a good platform I think.\n\nPuzzles \u2014 For puzzles, questions can be practiced from geeks for geeks, interview bit, and leetcode as well.\n\nFor the Analyst role especially \u2014 You should be handy with ML concepts along with the mathematical proofs and Matrix algebra, Probability and Statistics, and Algebra(Quadratic Equation-JEE standard) as well. You can follow these for probability \u2014 https://brainstellar.com/, 50 Challenging problems.\n\nProject Details :\n\nI was working in the payment team of Amazon. My project includes designing and developing an API and integrating it with another API. I had to test the API functionality and the integration as well. Though I can\u2019t share the exact details about the project I worked in JAVA along with some frameworks.\n\nThe languages and the frameworks which are to be used are project and company dependant but you should be familiar with OOP concepts and any previous experience in developing software will help you.\n\nHow was your experience working from home? What difficulties did you face?\n\nWork from home was definitely challenging. I missed the opportunity to interact with my teammates and my fellow interns in person.\n\nBut the company tried to make the internship hassle-free and interactive as much as possible. They organized a smooth virtual onboarding session and I was provided with IT equipment. I was assigned a manager and a mentor with whom I had regular meetings on weekly basis. I also got the chance to be present in the team meetings. The team was really helpful. I could approach any team member anytime to solve doubts. Meeting with the teammates virtually kept me in vibe with the organization.\n\nI did not see any change in the number of offers with respect to the previous years in the profiles I applied for. So I am assuming it will be the same this year also. No need to worry.\n\nAccording to you who should ideally apply for this intern?\n\nPeople who are interested in algorithms and Data Structure and want to pursue a career in software development can apply for Amazon.\n\nAnd what advice will you give to them?\n\nRevise the things before exams. If you have time after each screening test, discuss or solve the uncompleted or left questions that were asked and looked through the concepts you missed.\n\nDON\u2019T FAKE YOUR CV UP TO A LITTLE EXTENT!!! Be thorough with your Project. Prepare this question -What were the challenges you faced in your project and how did you overcome that?\n\nBefore the interview do a bit of research on the principle of the company. Be HONEST with every answer in the interview.\n\nBe calm. There is no reason to be anxious due to your poor performance in any screening test or in case you haven\u2019t got any offer till Day2.\n\nGood Luck!"

This summer I worked as a Software Engineering Intern at Salesforce.\n\nSelection procedure\n\nThere was one online coding shortlisting round, predominantly CP-based. The top candidates were then allowed to go through the main interviews. There were three technical rounds and an HR round. All of the technical rounds were CP-based and predominantly tested our thinking and coding abilities. One of them (the second one for me) involved evaluation based on past Internships and Projects, alongside solving algorithmic problems.\n\nHow to prepare for them?\n\nI feel that having practiced regularly from LeetCode would definitely help the candidate in clearing the preliminary rounds. Also, I would suggest that you keep participating in Codeforces / Codechef contests frequently in order to be in the habit of solving problems in a time-bounded format. However, in the final technical round, I was given one single problem, which I think was of 2000\u20132200 rating in Codeforces having a CP background did help me during the interview.\n\nYour Project Details\n\nI was in the Health Cloud team at Salesforce. My project was aimed at recognizing, analyzing, and storing data automatically, directly from medical conversations. I worked on the NLP domain of automating the storage of patient interactions. We automated the patient onboarding process, to lay the groundwork by a collection of patient demographics information and storage using FHIR standards in the Healthcare Organisation. It executed an automatic voice conversation with a new patient trying to register himself/herself to a healthcare provider (through a phone call) without any manual intervention, and updated the analyzed data to the Health Organisation Database. It was an amazing learning experience for me!!!\n\nHow was your experience working from home? What difficulties did you face?\n\nIt was awesome, I\u2019d say. The Ohana Salesforce is very welcoming and I enjoyed each day. My manager is a KGP-alumnus and my mentor talked to me at least twice each day. Our team (from KGP, with Shashank Bonda and Ankit Saurabh) even won the InTurn hackathon at Salesforce. Salesforce also gifted us with a lot of amazing Swags very frequently throughout the duration of the internship and also provided us with all necessities (like a laptop). Though I miss the in-office experience and had few connection issues due to the Yaas cyclone, the remote internship journey was extremely well managed.\n\nWhat effect could Covid have in the upcoming internship process?\n\nOne trend that I have seen during Covid, is that a lot of people are participating in coding contests very frequently these days, probably due to more time available aside from college. The competition for tech internships is growing tougher each year in Covid. So, even the importance of participating in CP contests and being thorough with the algorithms and data structures is also growing with time.\n\nAccording to you who should ideally apply for this internship?\n\nPeople who love solving algorithmic problems and want to get a wonderfully memorable exposure to working at a Tech firm should definitely apply for interning at Salesforce. If you are a tech geek, it\u2019s an experience you don\u2019t want to miss in life.\n\nAnd what advice will you give to them?\n\nIf you are good at CP and have a decent background in Tech, you\u2019ll definitely ace coding interviews at top companies like Salesforce.\n\nThis is my coding during the internship.\n\nabj_macbook.png\n\n(144K)\n\nThis is our winning team (Hackathon) at Salesforce.\n\nhack.jpeg\n\n(176K)"

        "content": "FORESIGHT(2021): Summer Internship at Goldman Sachs |Hardik Tibrewal\n\n--\n\nListen\n\nBrief Introduction\n\nHey everyone, I am Hardik Tibrewal, a Final Year Undergraduate student from the Department of Electronics and Electrical Communication, IIT Kharagpur. I completed an internship at Goldman Sachs in Summer 2021. I was selected as part of their on-campus recruitment program in IIT-KGP.\n\nSelection procedure\n\nThe selection procedure was Goldman Sachs consisted of two stages. The first was an online test conducted on Hackerrank. It consisted of 5 sections: Computer Science Theory, Probability and Statistics, 2 easy coding problems, 1 medium coding problem, and English Writing skills. Your CGPA is the 6th metric on which they judge you. The selection criterion was performing to their standards in at least 3 of the 6 areas, as far as I remember. If shortlisted, there were 3 rounds of interviews. All of them were technical rounds, with some rounds focusing on probability and statistics, whereas the others focusing on DSA(Data Structures and Algorithms) problems. There was no HR round.\n\nHow to prepare for them?\n\nFor the online test, keep practicing CP till the end (see the Metakgp page for resources). In the month when the tests are scheduled to happen, start brushing up on Comp. Sci. basics and Prob-Stats, courses which you will have most likely completed by then, either with your institute curriculum or online. You can practice writing short answers to questions like \u201cWhat are your motivations in life?\u201d and other common questions like this if you aren\u2019t confident in your writing skills. For interviews, keep working on your DSA knowledge, and go through the basics of Object-oriented programming if you aren\u2019t familiar with it. Also check out sites like BrainStellar for practicing probability puzzles, which will be asked in the first round.\n\nYour Project Details\n\nI was assigned a Software Development project, which was designing functionality for one of their applications. I worked with Java, but the projects are assigned to you and you aren\u2019t offered a choice, so don\u2019t worry about the specific skills you will need to know before your internship. If you get a software role, it will be beneficial if you have worked on at least some small project of your own and are familiar with Git, at least. Even if you aren\u2019t, you will have time to figure it out.\n\nHow was your experience working from home? What difficulties did you face?\n\nThe company tried to make WFH as pleasant and interactive as possible. While you obviously miss out on a lot of experiences and, most importantly, networking opportunities online, the overall experience was great for me. As long as you have a decent laptop, a good internet connection, and take the initiative to reach out to people when needed, you won\u2019t face any issues.\n\nWhat effect could Covid have in the upcoming internship process?\n\nUnless the dreaded third wave arrives before the selection process, the situation faced by this batch will be the same as we faced last year. Please try to arrange for a reliable internet connection and power supply if you can. Try to find a quiet spot without any disturbances or people near you, since that may cause issues during online tests. Form a small group of friends with whom you can talk and vent out any frustrations you will inevitably have during the process.\n\nAccording to you who should ideally apply for this intern?\n\nPeople who are flexible regarding the work they will be given because depending on your tests and interviews, you will be assigned a role that may be finance-oriented or software-oriented. You may be asked for your preference in the interviews, but the final decision will be up to the firm, and you won\u2019t be able to change it. If this is not an issue for you, you can happily apply for this role.\n\nAnd what advice will you give to them?\n\nPeople tend to ignore their communication skills when applying for interns. Do not do that. Your communication skills will play a significant part in your process (at least in my opinion). Keep improving your DSA and Prob-Stats knowledge. Also, be in touch with PlaceComm members on the day of your interviews, so they can help you if anything goes wrong. Don\u2019t be afraid to reach out to seniors if you have questions. Best of luck"

I am from Radhakrishnan Hall of Residence. I joined Deutsche Bank as a Summer Analyst through CDC.\n\nSelection procedure :\n\nDeutsche Bank\u2019s selection process has 2 steps:\n\n1.CV shortlisting: DB (Deutsche Bank) shortlists 15\u201320 students based on their CVs. They look for a well-rounded CV and any prior knowledge/experience in finance is a brownie point. Although they do not mention an explicit CG criterion, they generally look for CG > 8. At this point, DB also asks for a cover letter in which they want to know why the candidate wants to join DB and conducts a test that consists solely of various scenarios one might face in the office (HR questions)\n\n2.Interviews: DB usually conducts 3 rounds of interviews (this may vary depending on their needs). The rounds will include HR questions, Puzzles, CV-based questions, and test your general understanding of finance and your inclination towards the field.\n\nHow to prepare for them?\n\nI would divide the preparation into 3 parts.\n\nPuzzles/Probability: Heard on the Street would be your go-to book for this, as most of the puzzles that DB asks for will be from there. You can also go through other books like Xinfeng Zhou and 50 Challenging Problems in probability.\n\nFinance Knowledge: Ensure that you are very good with macroeconomic concepts; there are crash courses available on YouTube that cover all the essential topics. Try and brush up on the recent trends in business and financial markets. MOOCs or CFA material will help you learn the basic concepts and financial tools.\n\nCV prep: Ensure that you can defend everything in your CV.\n\nYour Project Details\n\nAlthough I cannot disclose the details of my project due to compliance rules, I can tell you that the internship will be highly beneficial as the first week will be a Bootcamp on financial instruments and derivatives. Throughout the internship, there will be interaction with various business heads and smaller training sessions available to you. All of the assigned projects were directly used by the desk, and I was also given the opportunity to work on active client requests.\n\nCompany Culture\n\nDeutsche Bank actively encourages people from different teams to talk to one another and share knowledge. Even as an intern, I could easily set up meetings with any business head and pick their brains with all queries I had. Interns are taken very seriously in the company and even as an intern my opinions were always heard and taken into consideration.\n\nWhat effect could COVID have in the upcoming internship process?\n\nDuring my CDC, I believe that DB selected fewer interns than before. However, I would not imagine they would select fewer than 4 interns in the upcoming internship process.\n\nWho should ideally apply for this internship?\n\nAnybody that has an aptitude for finance and is interested in exploring a possible career in the field.\n\nWhat advice will you give to them?\n\nMake the interviews as interactive as possible. The fact that you have gotten shortlisted means that they already believe you have the skills they are looking for. They just want to know how you think, throughout the internship There allowed and if you are someone, they would like to work with at the interview level."

I received an offer from JP Morgan Chase(CIB Research & Analytics, Markets). Here, I have noted down my experience of going through the shortlisting and interview rounds.\n\nShortlisting rounds:\n\nFor shortlisting, there were 2 tests. The first test had Mathematics puzzles(basic), questions on English, and Reasoning. The second test had problems with Probability and Statistics. All the questions of the 2 tests were objective.\n\nInterview rounds:\n\nThere were two rounds of interview for JPMC -\n\n1. The Technical Round \u2014 In this round, we were asked to brief our projects and internships mentioned in our CV, followed by were given problems on Probability and basic Mathematics puzzles. They also tested our knowledge of Data Structures and Algorithms. There were 9 problems in total. It was not mandatory to have prior knowledge of Finance. The interview went on for about 35 min. The main focus of the discussion was the problems. Not much was asked from the CV.\n\n2. The HR Round \u2014 This round was more like an informal conversation, where the interviewer asked about my family background, why I want to intern at JPMC etc. This round hardly lasted for 15 min. The interviewer also briefed me about the working environment at JPMC and the procedure I had to follow if I received the offer.\n\nPreparation:\n\nWe need to practice problems on Probability and Statistics. Some resources are: Heard on the Street\n\n50 challenging problems in Probability\n\nAlso, it is advisable to practice quant problems and revise the basic concepts of DSA.\n\nA brief overview of my project:\n\nDepending on the team we are a part of and our field of interest, we are allotted different projects. For me, it was mostly automating some tasks(as my interests were\n\ninclined towards that). Since a lot of the information (clients/products) related to our projects are confidential, here is a brief overview of 2 projects I worked on at JPMC: 1. Creation of some automating tools for facilitating the Sales Team in carrying out their tasks more efficiently.\n\n2. Automating the generation of financial reports to be sent to clients: JPMC has its investible indices, the performance of these indices, and some other details that need to be sent in specific formats to the respective clients to automate one such report.\n\nExperience from work from home:\n\nWorking from home has both pros and cons.\n\nAs for pros, we can work through our doubts any time, even beyond office hours, although we are asked not to overwork. Also, a lot of our time for traveling and other formalities gets saved in online mode.\n\nFor cons, it gets relatively challenging to clarify doubts as there is nothing more efficient than in-person interaction. Also, networking with other team members is not as efficient in online mode.\n\nWhat effect could Covid have in the upcoming internship process?\n\nIn the online process, we may face technical issues during interviews/tests. On the bright side, online interviews can be less grilling than offline ones.\n\nAccording to you, who should ideally apply for this intern?\n\nThis is a Fintech profile, so anyone who inclines financial markets, and interest in OOP and DSA, can apply for JPMC (Markets) profile. Even those who have no prior knowledge of Finance can apply for JPMC.\n\nAnd what advice will you give to them?\n\nTo the internship aspirants, the CDC Internship season can be pretty stressful. Remember, CDC is not the only option you have. Try to remain strong during the process, and you\u2019ll ace it. All the best!"

I completed my 8-week long summer internship at Microsoft. I was part of the Professional Services (Microsoft Digital) Team which is part of Microsoft\u2019s Core services engineering and operations group.\n\nSelection Procedure:\n\nThe selection process involved one coding round followed by 3 interview rounds. Before last year Microsoft used to conduct 2 coding contests before shortlisting for interviews, but last year they conducted only one and used CPGA for shortlisting.\n\nThe coding round for most companies is conducted on the Hackerrank platform, but for Microsoft, it is usually conducted on the Mettl platform which many don\u2019t find friendly. Just be a bit more cautious and calm while giving the test if you are not familiar with the platform. The round consisted of 3 questions which were the same for all students. The questions were easy and were from topics like dynamic programming, greedy algorithm and one was a simple brute force problem.\n\nThe first two interview rounds were again coding based where one question was asked in each round. The first round included designing a sorting algorithm without using comparison operators while the second round included a DP-based question. During the interview, it is very important that while thinking about the solution of the problem you think out loud. As in my case, it helped me to get some guidance from the interviewer for getting to the correct solution. The final round was mostly based on topics mentioned in my CV and some problem-solving. The whole interview experience was pretty chill.\n\nHow to prepare for them:\n\nFor software engineering-based profiles a good knowledge of Algorithm and Data Structures is essential. You can take the Algorithms I course of the CSE department or can do an online course on DSA. Once the basics of DSA are clear, there are many sources to practice problem-solving. GeeksforGeeks, Leetcode, InterviewBits, A2OJ ladder, etc. I would suggest selecting any two of the available resources, instead of jumping between different platforms. Apart from these, you can participate in competitive programming contests on code forces and CodeChef to get an idea of your progress.\n\nMy internship project details:\n\nMy project was involved a Machine learning-based multi-class classification problem. It involved creating different machine learning models, creating Restful APIs, and some work involving Microsoft Azure. The project was mostly coded in C#. Most of the technologies used in the project can be learned during the internship itself and there are no prerequisites.\n\nInternship experience:\n\nThe internship experience was really good. People are always present there to help you out in any difficulty you face, whether related to the project. Many fun and informative events were conducted throughout the internship period. The project work was also very interesting, and the project timeline was pretty lenient. The only thing lacking during the period was interaction with fellow interns due to the online work mode.\n\nWhat effect could Covid have in the upcoming internship process?\n\nNow, mostly all of us have become accustomed to the online mode of learning and working. Last year also the entire process was online and went pretty smooth. During the whole process in an online manner, we become lonely and try to be in touch with all batch mates and seniors. Talking with people will reduce all the anxiety related to the process. Be confident and hope for the best.\n\nWho should apply for this internship?\n\nAll the technology enthusiasts and coding geeks can apply for this opportunity. There is a lot of scope for learning new technologies and skills during the internship period.\n\nAdvice for them:\n\nMy advice for you all is to be confident and believe in yourself. Be firm on your fundamentals. The internship process itself will be a learning experience. There will be days when things won\u2019t go your way. Try to learn from them. Don\u2019t get demotivated when you don\u2019t get a shot in some of the companies. Again have belief in yourself, and you will find a company matching your skill sets."

I did my summer internship at Mathworks (Hyderabad Campus). Mathworks is basically a product-based multinational company whose major product is MATLAB. The internship was for 2 months and I worked under Hardware-Software Codesign team on HDL Coder toolbox of MATLAB.\n\nSelection Procedure:\n\nLast year, Mathworks was open for all departments. There were two rounds for selections. First was the coding round where questions related to programming were asked. There were MCQ as well as coding questions. 12 people were shortlisted in the first round. The second round was a Video Call interview. The interviewer asked a few questions on CV and then provided a hackerrank interactive platform where I was asked to write and run certain codes. Then I was asked a few questions on C++ STL library and whether I want to go for higher studies or not. Out of 12, 5 were selected for the internship and three of us chose Hyderabad campus.\n\nHow to prepare for them:\n\nFor the coding round, one should have proper knowledge of data structures and time complexity of different algorithms(like sorting, searching etc). One can study all the relevant theories from GeeksforGeeks. Everything is pretty well explained there. For practice, one can refer to InterviewBit or Leetcode. One needs to understand that there is cut-throat competition in all the online tests so cutoffs are generally quite high and one needs to solve most of the questions in order to qualify to the next round. In such a situation speed really matters along with problem-solving skills.\n\nYour Project Details:\n\nAs I mentioned above, I worked under the Hardware Software codesign team. My work was to build a feature in HDL Workflow Advisor of HDL Coder toolbox. It may sound like some hardware stuff but the work was completely on software development. All the basic knowledge related to hardware was quite easy to understand and was learnt parallelly during the course of my project. I did not have any prior knowledge of the toolbox I was working on and had the least experience of working in MATLAB but I did not face any difficulty. Mathworks provides lots of online training to all its new joinees so that no faces any problem while onboarding.\n\nHow was your experience working from home? What difficulties did you face?\n\nWhat effect could COVID have in the upcoming internship process?\n\nMathworks is still hiring students for their internship program. However, it may happen that they take less number of people as compared to last year. But this is just an assumption from my end. I do not have any clear idea of how many interns they are willing to hire this year.\n\nAccording to you, who should ideally apply for this internship?\n\nMathworks works on a variety of fields. There are a huge number of toolboxes present in MATLAB. Anyone who is interested in any of hardware, software, image processing, computer vision, deep learning can consider Mathworks for an internship.\n\nAnd what advice will you give to them?\n\nTo the Mathworks internship aspirants:\n\nThe selections are purely based on coding skills and do not involve any other knowledge. The questions are not that tough. Be confident and fluent during the interview. The people who are willing to go for higher studies in future are generally not preferred by interviewers because they invest a lot of resources and time during the internship and won\u2019t like someone to quit the company after the internship or after working for one or two years.\n\nTo the people who get selected:\n\nThere is a lot of scope to learn at Mathworks. They have a separate portal which consists of all kinds of interactive online training that you need to know. At first, one joins the Engineering Development Group Department in Mathworks where the basic aim is to groom the individual so that he/she can explore all the options, know more about the company and then finally settle into one of key areas at Mathworks. There are a lot of career options open for the future within Mathworks. The amount of career growth will be huge. Regarding the evaluation for PPO, apart from work on the project, one is also evaluated on the basis of soft skills such as communication skills, presentation skills, leadership skills, ability to take initiative, time management, willingness to participate etc. So make sure you pay attention to these things too.\n\nAt last, to all the internship aspirants, I would say, be calm and patient. There will be times when things will not happen according to your plan even if you are putting a lot of efforts but everything will fall into place as the time will pass. Never lose hope and keep doing hard work. Try to learn as much as you can. It will help you grow as an individual.\n\nAll the best,\n\nTanmay Das"

I interned at ZestMoney \u2014 a lending Fintech company, during summer 2020 as a part of its Product Management team. ZestMoney uses Mobile Technology, Digital Banking, and AI to provide the fastest way to pay using EMI even if you do not have a credit card.\n\nSelection Procedure:\n\nThe selection procedure includes CV shortlisting, online test, and interview. The online test was to make a blueprint focusing on the feasibility and implementation of a real-case scenario. 10 students were selected for the final PI round. It was a telephonic interview, where they first focussed on CV and then questioned the feasibility and implementation part from the blueprint.\n\nHow to prepare for them:\n\nFor the online test, you can prepare case studies. I have studied some cases before but I mostly applied the knowledge from the course \u201cProduct Development\u201d I had that semester. For the interview round, be thorough with your CV and solve puzzles from online sites like geeksforgeeks. Prepare Quant and Guesstimates from books or any online source. If you havetime, you can revise your case studies and the online test questions too.\n\nYour Project Details:\n\nI have analyzed the problems faced by current users using user research and proposed ideas to improve user feedback in the form of Product Requirements Document (PRD). I have used the Agile methodology to develop and execute the detailed version of product roadmaps to create a better ecosystem for merchants and researched user stories to prioritise features using Story Mapping techniques.\n\nHow was your experience working from home? What difficulties did you face?\n\nI had an amazing experience working with ZestMoney even from home. Mentors were quite encouraging and friendly. At a certain point, I faced some issues regarding the internet, and since I was on Campus, I had to travel back home but they were quite supportive and even recorded the session for me. They also conducted fun activities which I enjoyed a lot. The experience was totally invaluable.\n\nWhat effect could COVID have in the upcoming internship process?\n\nCOVID has already affected quite a few Internships and placements. Students would have to compete more to get certain positions in the internship. Make your mindsets already to work for experience and gaining knowledge. I would suggest students to not panic and support each other during these hard times.\n\nAccording to you, who should ideally apply for this internship?\n\nZestMoney doesn\u2019t require a candidate to have prior knowledge in finance or product management. They see your interests but it really helps if you have already got some knowledge or experience. If you want to apply for this particular company, then prepare case studies and guesstimates a month prior and you can also take some subjects related to product or finance.\n\nAnd what advice will you give to them?\n\nMy advice to the upcoming batch would be to have confidence and believe in yourself. Apply for each and every company and go give tests for each of them too, especially when you don\u2019t know which one is best for you! It\u2019s all a part of learning and getting experience."

        "content": "FORESIGHT(2020): Summer Internship Dr Reddy\u2019s laboratories| Anmol Joshi\n\n--\n\nListen\n\nBrief Introduction:\n\nI am Anmol Joshi, a final year student of Chemical Engineering department and a boarder of MS Hall. I interned at Dr. Reddy\u2019s laboratories at the end of my third year and got a pre-placement offer.\n\nSelection Procedure:\n\nThe selection process of Dr. Reddy\u2019s consists of 4 rounds. First off, there is a CV shortlisting, which is followed by a test. Almost all the students go-ahead for the GD round next, and finally, an interview consisting of a mix of technical and HR questions takes place.\n\nHow to prepare for them:\n\nIn general, almost everyone applying for the internship is shortlisted for the GD round irrespective of CV and how well they fared in the test.\n\nThe test consists of questions from chemistry and core chemical engineering questions (for CH students), along with sections of psychometric and reasoning based questions.\n\nThe third round, which is the GD round, is where the major elimination begins and that is where your core chemical engineering knowledge comes into play. It is important to have your basic concepts involving heat, mass and momentum transfer sound, along with the ability to explain where a particular concept fits right.\n\nThe final interview is where you are mostly grilled on your CV, so it is important to be prepared on whatever you include in it.\n\nYour Project Details:\n\nProjects at Dr. Reddy\u2019s can be allotted in R&D, manufacturing or any other department based on the company\u2019s requirements. I was allotted a project on the analysis of scale-up for the production of a pharmaceutical drug intermediate.\n\nHow was your experience working from home? What difficulties did you face?\n\nA remote internship does have its own shortcomings, in terms of the fact that you feel isolated at times and might not be able to touch base with your project mentor for as long as a week. It is therefore imperative upon you to connect with your mentor and let him be known of the developments at regular intervals. My project seemed a bit boring at times as I could not get the direct exposure of what goes on at the manufacturing facility during drug production at a large scale.\n\nWhat effect could Covid have in the upcoming internship process?\n\nAn online GD is certainly not the best option for shortlisting students for the final interview process, so it is possible that a company like Dr. Reddy\u2019s might just put out a case for the applicants involving a technical issue that the company faces or one that could help increase the efficiency of a processor device. However, tests and interviews could just remain as they are.\n\nAccording to you, who should ideally apply for this internship?\n\nAnyone who is interested in core, and has followed whatever has been taught in the second and third year as a part of the chemical engineering curriculum.\n\nAnd what advice will you give to them?\n\nFirst of all, be absolutely sure that you have a genuine interest in core, irrespective of your CGPA. If you get your concepts clear and more importantly be able to explain them, securing a core chemical engineering internship should be a cakewalk. Also, be thorough on whatever you have mentioned on your CV, because a lot of companies ask you to go through it."

        "content": "FORESIGHT(2018): Summer Internship Goldman Sachs| Anubhav Jain\n\n--\n\nListen\n\nBrief Introduction:\n\nMy name is Anubhav Jain and I am pursuing B.Tech. in Computer Science and Engineering at IIT Kharagpur. I interned during summers 2018 at Goldman Sachs, which is a leading global investment banking firm. I worked in the Securities Division, and my internship was 10 weeks long.\n\nSelection Procedure:\n\nGoldman Sachs is open for students of all the departments.\n\nFirstly, there is a test which a student needs to clear to qualify for the interview round. The test consists of the following three sections :\n\n1. Computer Science (Coding) \u2014 5 MCQs on core computer science concepts, 2 coding questions.\n\n2. Quantitative Analysis (Quant) \u2014 10 questions, MCQs/Numerical answer type questions.\n\n3. Machine Learning \u2014 10 MCQs.\n\nOne important thing to note is that to qualify for the interview round, one doesn\u2019t need to excel in all the three sections. Goldman Sachs comes to hire for different teams, and they expect you to expertise in at least one of the sections, but not necessarily all of them. Different teams that GS hired people for this time are Securities, Technology, Risk, Investment Management Division (though there exist many more teams). Nevertheless, the work you do here in any of the teams is technological and engineering related. These different teams shortlist candidates for interviews based on different sections of the test. So even if you excel in only one section, you\u2019ll definitely be shortlisted by at least one team, and if you perform just moderate in all sections, you might not get shortlisted for an interview at all.\n\nNext comes the interview round. The type of questions that are asked depends on the team taking your interview. And the number of interviews you might end up giving depends on the number of teams who shortlist you and also on how you perform in subsequent interviews. I gave 5 interviews, all lasting about half an hour. Some (talking about those who got selected) were finished in 2\u20133 interviews only, while some ended up giving 7\u20138 interviews as well.\n\nHow to prepare for them:\n\nIf I talk about the written test first, then for different sections, a different kind of preparation is required. All sections consisted of all levels of questions, ranging from easy to difficult.\n\nCoding section: GeeksforGeeks for practising different algorithms and data structures, InterviewBit for coding practice. Doing these two things are more than enough.\n\nQuant section: For those who have taken ProbStats course can revise the notes and practice questions on the subject, and there is also a book \u201cHeard on the Street\u201d that is useful in preparing for the quant section.\n\nML section: I felt that doing only Andrew Ng\u2019s course was not sufficient for this section. A few theoretical questions can be expected from the course, but some advanced topics like Bagging, SVM Kernels etc. were also there.\n\nThere is nothing different to be prepared for interviews. Interview questions will be similar, maybe just with a bit more level of difficulty.\n\nYour Project Details:\n\nMostly everyone here is given a unique project. My project revolved around adding a feature to an existing trading platform (coded in Java) and writing a utility to create reports (in Python).\n\nCompany Culture:\n\nThe environment here is quite chill and friendly. There are no time restrictions (come and go whenever comfortable), no particular dress code (casuals are allowed). People are very easily approachable here, one can freely talk to any person at any position without any hesitation. All in all, you grow here in a team, working together with different people at different locations.\n\nAccording to you who should ideally apply for the intern:\n\nAll the technology enthusiasts/ coding geeks/ finance loving people can freely put their trump cards to get in here.\n\nAnd what advice will you give to them:\n\nI\u2019m going to mention this thing just to make things clear. GS is majorly an investment banking firm. Someone might think that work here majorly is related to finance and in future, if you land at GS, your field completely becomes finance-oriented. However, this is not completely true. Work for the engineering divisions, that GS hire people for from IITs, is mostly technological. But to understand the background of the work you are doing, you need to understand the finance behind the technological requirements, thus with time, you tend to develop more knowledge in finance. So yeah, you might get deeper into finance, but you won\u2019t get your hands off the technological work you do.\n\nAlso, it\u2019s important to keep in mind that not everyone gets the same experience at any place. What you take out of this journey definitely depends on the firm, the team you are working in and also on you, how well you adapt yourself to a corporate environment, and how well you are able to interact and mix up with everyone around you.\n\nI\u2019d like to end this by saying \u201cevery day is a learning experience!\u201d, take most out of whatever opportunity you get.\n\nGood luck!\n\nWarm Regards,\n\nAnubhav Jain"

So I will introduce myself. I am Sayan Mandal, from the Computer Science and Engineering department, about to go into my fifth and final year at IIT Kharagpur. I interned at Microsoft IDC after the end of my fourth year as a Data Scientist Intern and got a Pre-Placement Offer from Microsoft.\n\nSelection Procedure:\n\nMicrosoft\u2019s selection procedure is pretty simple. They have a CGPA cutoff of 7 for a candidate to sit for the test conducted by Microsoft. Basically, there were 3 stages:\n\n\u25cf They conducted an online coding test initially. The test had 3 coding questions and we had to solve it within 1 hour.\n\n\u25cf After the online coding round, they conducted a Group Fly round where they gave a problem statement to all the candidates and we had to discuss with the mentors and come up with a good solution as well as implementing the solution on pen and paper. Be sure to improve your implementation skills. No matter how easy the algorithm is, you need to implement it fast on pen and paper. There was a time limit of 1 hour. Be sure to talk to your mentors properly and implement your solution efficiently on the paper.\n\n\u25cf Those who cleared the group fly round advanced to the Interview. Personally, I had three rounds of interviews. In the first round, They asked me about algorithms and data structure. I had to write code on the paper for all the questions. In the second round, I was asked questions from Natural Language Processing and AI. Luckily, I was somewhat aware of these fields and I was able to answer the questions. In the third round, they asked me about the projects I did on my previous internships. Surprisingly, I had to write code on the paper in my third round too. So it is highly recommended to practice writing bug-free code on the paper.\n\nHow to prepare for them:\n\nPractice, practice and practice. Those who are familiar with competitive programming will get benefits above others. But it is very easy to crack good companies with two or three months of rigorous practice. Some good resources will be: geekforgeeks, Interviewbit, Leetcode. If these sources are okayish for you go for codeforces, spoj, HackerEarth etc. For dual degree people, be sure to cover OS, DBMS and networks a little bit for safety. For particularly Microsoft, be sure to improve your implementation skill.\n\nYour Project Details:\n\nI worked for the Office Project (\u201cProject\u201d is one of the many products of Office365) team. I worked on an open-ended problem based on Natural Language Processing. I had some experience in NLP, So I didn\u2019t face many difficulties in approaching the problem from my side. They usually go through your resume while assigning you to various teams and go through your past projects, any special skills or courses taken, but in many cases, it can be randomly allotted as well.\n\nCompany Culture:\n\nMicrosoft takes quite a lot of pride in its culture after Satya Nadella became CEO. Some of the key points are:\n\n\u25cf Flexible Timing. You can come and leave the office anytime you want. Everyone is happy as long as you are doing your job well. No one rolls an eye at your office timing or your uniforms.\n\n\u25cf One Microsoft. This is a term used frequently within Microsoft. This signifies although there are lots and lots of teams within Microsoft, everyone is under Microsoft. So you can ask your doubts to anyone within your team as well as out of your team. For my case, I took a lot of help from a senior software engineer in Redmond and he was very friendly and helped me a lot throughout my internship.\n\n\u25cf Growth Mindset. This signifies Microsoft wants to hire people who want to learn it all rather than who knows it all.\n\n\u25cf When it comes to a fun office environment, Microsoft has numerous pool tables, foosball tables etc. There is an Xbox room (obviously). You can play table tennis, cricket, volleyball etc. (just google \u201cMicrosoft IDC Hyderabad campus\u201d). There will be a team outing, lunch and you will be getting goodies from Microsoft.\n\nAccording to you who should ideally apply for the intern:\n\nAnyone who loves computer science, coding and who wants to work in a big tech company and wants to learn about the Technologies of Tech giants should definitely apply for this internship. On a side note, those who are interested in pursuing research should not apply. One positive point of this internship is you will get the Microsoft brand in your resume.\n\nAnd what advice will you give to them:\n\nJust a piece of general advice, don\u2019t just run after the money and try to run away from the hype called \u201cday 1 intern\u201d. Try to choose companies wisely according to your interest."

        "content": "FORESIGHT(2018): Summer Internship Credit Suisse| Shweta Gupta\n\n--\n\n1\n\nListen\n\nBrief Introduction:\n\nI am Shweta Gupta, a final year student, specializing in Financial Engineering. I have recently completed my summer internship in Market Liquidity & Risk Management(MLRM) profile at Credit Suisse, Mumbai.\n\nSelection Procedure:\n\nCredit Suisse has a very reasonable selection procedure and gives equal opportunity to all the departments. The whole procedure tests quantitative aptitude and problem-solving skills. Knowledge of Finance gives an edge but is not mandatory and the company provides sufficient training to enable understanding and completion of the project. The selection procedure consists of four steps:\n\nStep 1: CV Shortlisting. The company shortlists a good number of candidates for the written test and there is no fixed CG criteria as such.\n\nStep 2: The Test. The selection test conducted is very unique and is the most important factor in the selection process. It mainly consists of subjective questions centred around Probability & Statistics, Partial Differentials, Integrals and a few basic questions from Finance(typically Derivatives). Presenting the solution properly is of prime importance as the approach adopted for each question is critically judged.\n\nStep 3: The Interviews. After the test, the selected candidates have to go through two rounds of interviews, depending upon the candidate. The interview starts with discussing the test questions(primarily the unattempted ones) followed by a few puzzles and CV based questions. There is no ideal way of preparing for these interviews as these depend a lot on the individual\u2019s profile as well as your conversation with the interviewers. Prepare your CV well and keep your mind fresh. The interviewers are very helpful and will guide you in case you stutter sometimes.\n\nStep 4: HR Interview. Again, there is no straightforward technique to prepare for this. All you can do is have a look at some common HR questions. Asking a lot of questions is key in this round, as well as this internship.\n\nHow to prepare for them:\n\nStudy the relevant topics from Iyengar, Montgomery, Class Notes and practice puzzles from Heard on the Street, 50 Challenging Problems in Probability. For questions based on Finance, a basic understanding of Derivatives from Investopedia/Khan Academy or other online sources would be sufficient. If you are a Financial Engineering student or have some background in Finance, be well versed with all the completed courses/internships.\n\nYour Project Details:\n\nAll interns are assigned different teams and different projects. There is a lot of variety in projects across different teams, each requiring a different skillset. My project was under the Solutions Methodology Team which works on developing and implementing Market Risk Methodologies for Rates, FX & Commodities. I had to document the Interest Rate Curve Construction details for Emerging Market Economies which required understanding their framework and the products involved.\n\nCompany Culture:\n\nTotally in love with the company culture! The work hours are flexible and require a daily minimum of 8\u20139 hours. Everybody in the company is very approachable and helpful. Employees have a good work-life balance and actively participate in the extra-curricular activities, philanthropy events and awareness drives. We also had various Speaker Series Session, where senior executives across the globe, shared their experiences and gave useful and interesting career insights. Overall, it was a great learning experience.\n\nAccording to you who should ideally apply for the intern:\n\nAnyone who\u2019s looking to explore avenues in Quantitative Finance should apply for this internship.\n\nAnd what advice will you give to them:\n\nCDC Internship process is a totally new and different experience for the most of us. Every company has a different strategy and looks for a specific skill set. It is therefore very important to first select profiles you are interested in and prepare accordingly. Take every little step as a challenge and keep on delivering your best.\n\nGood Luck!"

They take tests in their own software which they will ask you to download. They give only one question in the online round for which the time duration is three hours. You can compile code any number of times but the number of submissions is limited to ten(most probably). Once you submit and if all hidden test-cases run successfully, you are done, else you just lost one submission. If you lost all ten submissions, you can\u2019t submit anymore.\n\nOnline test is followed by a technical round and then an H-R round.\n\nHow to prepare for them:\n\nQuestions asked in the online round are very easy and mostly based on data structures like 2-D matrices. If you have done a little bit of coding in summers then you can easily crack this test. In the technical round also they ask simple questions about matrix, string matching, arrays, linked list, stacks, queues etc.\n\nI would suggest you start from geeksforgeeks and learn the basics of Data Structures then complete Topic-wise Algorithms.\n\nYour Project Details:\n\nIn SRI Noida, I was allocated to the Application Group. My Project was based on Machine Learning and Image Processing. I had to do research and develop an android controlled software using Deep Learning. Some of my mates got projects on AI and ML and some got projects in android development and enhancement. Moreover, the project you will get depends on which team you got allocated.\n\nCompany Culture:\n\nCompany culture is pretty nice. People are very nice and helpful. You will have to work 40 hours per week inside the office. On a daily basis, you have to be at least 4 hours a day inside the office for full attendance. That gives good flexibility in working. You will get lunch and dinner. You can also go to the cafe for coffee and drinks. For fitness, they have gym, yoga, zumba classes and medical room.\n\nAccording to you who should ideally apply for the intern:\n\nThose who want to do some good things in android development or in the mobile industry can go for this type of internship.

I did my Summer Internship at Credit Suisse as a Financial Technology Analyst.\n\nCredit Suisse Group AG is a Swiss multinational investment bank and financial services company founded and based in Switzerland. Headquartered in Z\u00fcrich, it maintains offices in all major financial centres around the world. As the second-largest bank in Switzerland, it is considered a \u201cBulge Bracket\u201d bank providing services in investment banking, private banking, asset management, and shared services. Credit Suisse is known for its strict bank-client and banking secrecy practices.\n\nSelection Procedure:\n\nThere was an online written test followed by a 3 round interview.\n\nThe online written test had 40 Questions for 60 minutes. The questions were from basic Mathematics, English, Quant, and Programming.\n\nThe basic Mathematics were from ratio proportions, average, fractions, etc.\n\nThe English were some fill in the blanks, paragraph questions, etc.\n\nThe Programming was detecting errors from some lines of code, predicting the output etc.\n\nCalculators weren\u2019t allowed for the test. So this test was a game of speed.\n\nAfter clearing the online written test, there were three rounds of interview.The first round was a Technical round where they asked questions about my CV like projects, scholarships, and skills. Also some fundamental questions from PDS like arrays, linked list are also asked.\n\nThe second round was Managerial round which was similar to the technical round, but they ask about some situations/life events of mine which was difficult to handle for me, but I was able to handle it successfully.\n\nThe final round was HR round where they ask about my interest, strengths, weakness, life goals, plans for further studies and why I want to join Credit Suisse as I am from a circuit branch with a good CGPA (9.0+) and Credit Suisse is a bank? Also, he asked me what I know about Credit Suisse?\n\nAfter giving satisfactory answers to HR, I was selected for IT profile in Credit Suisse.\n\nHow to prepare for them:\n\nBrush up 6th to 10th-grade Mathematics will be useful. Some knowledge of Algorithms and PDS will be excellent. Other sources like puzzles from Geeksforgeeks, 50 Challenging Problems in Probability will be helpful.\n\nYour Project Details:\n\nI worked on a web application that takes some input from the user then send it to the backend JAVA server that will fetch the data from the database server and then display the data to the user on the browser.\n\nThe technologies I have used were HTML, Angular 2, Typescript, Angular Material, Java 1.8, JAVA Rest Web service, JAVA Spring Framework, SQL.\n\nCompany Culture:\n\nCredit Suisse\u2019s culture is just excellent. The first main and different thing was we were instructed not to use Sir/Madam. Yes, you read it right, no Sir/Madam. You have to call everyone in the office by their first name regardless of how much senior they are to you, but you should also have politeness in your speech and actions.\n\nThe TA seniors (Those who joined as an employee less than two years) are great, and they gave the most funda for the office and its culture.\n\nThe office timings are flexible, no in or out time monitored, however on an average you need to work around 8 hours per day.\n\nAll the managers and TA seniors are approachable for any problem. All of them encourages new ideas and questions.\n\nYou will get free office cab services from your home address to the office, but your home should be in the same city.\n\nThere were endless treats from seniors, managers, and colleagues during the internship.\n\nSecurity for employees is excellent, especially for women. There are many types of securities present here. One example is there will always be a security guard in the office cab beside the driver if there is any female employee in the cab during the evening and late-night hours.\n\nAccording to you who should ideally apply for the intern:\n\nFor employees, there is an exclusive system. The employees can change their team after each year. So if you are not so sure about your career in finance, you can join Credit Suisse in IT/Analyst and later change to Finance team.\n\nAlso if you want to learn how a private and investment bank works and how they use technologies to maintain its security, then it will be an excellent place for you.\n\nAnd finally, if you want to know your possibility or prerequisites needed for a career in Finance then go ahead.\n\nAnd what advice will you give to them:\n\nDo read about the company before going to interview. If possible, please look about 2008\u2019s great depression and where was Credit Suisse\u2019s position at that time. Keep calm and stay focused. Great Luck."

I am from Rajendra Prasad Hall of Residence. I joined Flipkart as an SDE intern this Summer.\n\nSelection Procedure:\n\nFlipkart hired Software Development Interns from 8 IITs including Kgp. There was no CGPA cutoff or any other pre-requisite criteria. There were 2 phases in this hiring process.\n\nFirst there was a coding round on Hackerrank where we were given 3 problems to solve within an hour. Those who solved at least 2 problems properly were shortlisted for the personal interviews.\n\nIn the next phase there were 2 rounds of personal interviews which according to Flipkart\u2019s lingo are also known as \u201cPS & DS Algo\u201d. The best thing about these rounds is resume plays a very limited role since it is totally based on problem solving skills which ensures no bias among the candidates. Even the problems asked to every candidate were of similar difficulty. After this whole day process, 4 of us were selected as summer flinterns.\n\nHow to prepare for them:\n\nStrong grasp over Algorithms and Data Structures is the competency they look for. So practice problems from different topics of Algo and DS and spend some time on competitive coding platforms. Prior to the interview go through the FAQs for Software Development roles on geeksforgeeks. During the interviews, try to suggest the optimal solution and in case you\u2019re stuck ask for hints as well.\n\nYour Project Details:\n\nI was a part of the Logistics Insights Team at Ekart.

I interned during Summers of 2019 at Credit Suisse India Pvt. Ltd. which is a leading multinational investment bank and financial services company, advising clients in all aspects of finance across the globe. I worked in Global Markets(GM) IT division of the APAC(Asia-Pacific). The internship was 9 weeks long and started in the mid of May on 13th May.\n\nSelection Procedure:\n\nCredit Suisse is open for students of all the departments. It comes to hire for 3 different positions:1. Technology Intern2. Risk Management Analyst3. Finance Liquidity Risk AnalystIt came on DAY 2 for us but before that, it came in late October. As far as I remember, a single candidate can apply for only one of the positions and all the exams for these positions are conducted separately. I was the Technology Intern so I will discuss the same. To qualify for the interview, you need to clear the coding exam. The test consists of two parts:1. 25 MCQs- These questions are based on DS and Algo.2. 5 Coding Questions- 2 of 100 marks each and 3 of 200 marks each.The interview consists of 3 rounds:1. Coding round: DS and Algo2. CV round: Details of your internships and projects on the CV3. HR round: Basic stuff regarding your future goals (want to do a job or go for higher studies)\n\nHow to prepare for them:\n\nFor the written test first, GeeksforGeeks for practising different algorithms and data structures, InterviewBit for coding practice. Doing these two things are more than enough. If you are good enough at coding there is no need to prepare for MCQ separately, it has general questions related to DS and Algo. For interview:Coding Round: Be thorough with different Algos and also have proficient knowledge about the language which you use for coding, about the STL libraries (for C++).\n\nCV Round: Go through the projects thoroughly and make sure you are able to empathize with the interviewer and make him understand the projects from his perspective.HR Round: Just be clear with your future goals. There is no point in lying just tell frankly what you want to do with your life.\n\nYour Project Details:\n\nMy project was designing a health monitoring system for Apache Kafka. Being a bank, they didn\u2019t want to use any 3rd party APIs so I had to build everything from scratch. I had to configure Kafka and then build the utility in JAVA8 which was integrated into their pipeline of the trade reporting engine for Europe. My util generated and sent the status of different components of Kafka and also generated alerts in case of failure. Everyone was assigned adifferent kind of project and everyone had to work solely on that project.\n\nCompany Culture:\n\nThe environment here is quite chill and friendly. There are no time restrictions (come and go whenever comfortable depends on the timing in which zone you are working), the dress code is semi-formal or smart casuals. People are very easily approachable here, one can freely talk to any person at any position without any hesitation. They have a smart working environment where you can sit anywhere in office and work, there is no fixed seating areafor a person (you get smart cards for VMs which can be inserted in any keyboard). All in all, you grow here in a team, working together with different people at different locations. You get many treats and outings (depends solely on your team). People are very humble and generous, not only about the work but they will also guide you about the city, areas to visit and places suitable for your stay. They also have different coding competitions organized where they provide many goodies and also they organize many recreational activities. The workload is very minimal and you have enough time in hand to explore other lots of stuff.\n\nAccording to you who should ideally apply for the intern:\n\nAll the technology enthusiasts/ coding geeks/ finance loving people can apply. People who love finance but want to explore the technology perspective of it are the most suitable ones.\n\nAnd what advice will you give to them:\n\nCredit Suisse is majorly a multinational investment banking and financial service company. Someone might think that work here majorly is related to finance and in future, if you land at Credit Suisse, your field completely becomes finance-oriented. However, this is not completely true. But to understand the background of the work you are doing, you need tounderstand the finance behind the technological requirements, thus with time, you tend to develop more knowledge in finance. So yeah, you might get deeper into finance, but you won\u2019t get your hands off the technological work you do. If you join Credit Suisse, they have a special two-year program where you get to choose a different project in a different team of your interest after a year. The workload is very minimal for these two years, so people get alot of time to prepare for their masters as well.\n\nAlso, it\u2019s important to keep in mind that not everyone gets the same experience at any place. What you take out of this journey definitely depends on the firm, the team you are working in and also on you, how well you adapt yourself to a corporate environment, and how well you are able to interact and mix up with everyone around you.I would say that try to get the best out of whatever is present, learn from people around you. Don\u2019t lose hope, if something doesn\u2019t turn out to be the way you wanted, there is something much better ahead, just be \u201cPATIENT\u201d."

        "content": "FORESIGHT(2019): Summer Internship American Express| Saloni Meshram\n\n--\n\nListen\n\nBrief Introduction:\n\nBeing a student of Metallurgical and Materials Engineering Department, I had a very few options in core. This was known to me almost since my first year, thus I decided to go for non-core from the beginning. I would suggest each one of you know about the scope and opportunities in your department before deciding which profile to choose. During one of my internships, I was able toexplore the field Data Analytics and from there I decided to continue in the same.\n\nSelection Procedure:\n\nStudents from all the departments are eligible to apply. There was no CGPA cutoff.\n\nOnline Test: An online test with 20 MCQ questions is conducted once you apply. The test was quite easy. It consisted of questions on basic probability, mathematical aptitude, verbal and non-verbal reasoning and data interpretation. Make sure that you don\u2019t commit silly mistakes. Around 10 people were shortlisted for the next round.Technical Round: It started with a generic question, \u201cTell me about yourself\u201d. The discussion started with my previous internship at HDFC Bank, Mumbai. Then, the discussion revolved around the Boosting Algorithms. Among other people who were shortlisted, some were given questions related to guesstimates andprobability to solve along with some puzzles.Technical Round + HR:This round again began with my introduction and a brief explanation about my previous projects. Since AmEx and HDFC Bank deal in credit card, a major part of this round involved discussing my work at HDFC Bank. I was asked about some suggestion/new ideas as to how the data AmEx currently has can be used. Then, we moved towards my work at EY. Here, I had directly used thefuzzy-wuzzy library. So, I was asked to give the logic for building it from scratch. Then came the question, \u201cWhy should we hire you?\u201d and \u201cWhy Amex?\u201d. Be prepared for these questions.\n\nHow to prepare for them:\n\nBe thorough with your CV. Don\u2019t write a description about your internships that you can\u2019t explain. 2. Be prepared for questions like strengths, weakness, why should we hire you? etc. Think about these questions properly and tell them about actually why they should take you and what sets you apart. The interviewer has been in tons of interviews and will easily catch the generic answers.3. Keep practising aptitude questions and puzzles online on websites like IndiaBix. Also, brush up your concepts related to Probability. 4. Be comfortable with at least one programming language preferably Python.5. Know about the company before walking into the interview.\n\nYour Project Details:\n\nEvery intern was allowed a different project to work on. Each one of us had a mentor to guide us as the project proceeded. I was part of the International Line Modelling team. My team worked on delivering the models that would help the company decide which customer should be allotted what credit limit on the credit card. My project was an exploratory one wherein we were developing a dynamic model that would take personalized parameters and weights for each customer. I had to build this model for the US market. Thus, the person to whom my manager reported was in New York and we would discuss the progress of my project usually through Skype. I was solely working on this project under guidance from my mentor. I had written all the codes in Python which were completely automatic. But, most of my co-interns worked on SAS.\n\nCompany Culture:\n\nMost of the interns, including me, were in allocated the Gurgaon office while a few got the Bangalore one. The Gurgaon office seats over 6000 employees distributed across the 3 major divisions \u2014 Enterprise and Digital Analytics (EDA), Credit and Fraud Risk (CFR) and Technology. I was a part of the International Line Modelling Team from CFR with my job title as Credit and Risk Decision Science Intern. My office was in One Horizon Center building. The workspace is amazing and has been laid out quite creatively. All the interns were taken out for the fun event at Canvas Laugh Club so that we get to know each other. The company provides you with accommodation for 1 week and bears your travel expenses at the beginning and end of the internship. Also, the company provides transportation everyday anywhere in Delhi NCR region. The number of working days was 5 with timings being specific for a particular team. Team specific fun events and offsite trips to nearby locations happen once a year.\n\nThe best thing about AmEx has to be the people there. On the first day itself, we got to interact with the senior leaders of the company, who were really welcoming. The Director and the VP of my team got really involved in the work I was doing and we used to have regular brain-storming sessions. Also,the team members really looked out for each other and were quite helpful. I had a great time discussing everything and anything over lunch with my team. The HR people also made some efforts to arrange sessions with top executives from India and the US offices.\n\nWhat I liked the most about my internship:\n\nMy manager/mentor leveraged the comfort that I had with Python or else it would have taken me some time to get comfortable with SAS. My inputs were always considered even though due the time crunch everything could not be implemented. My teammates would always be ready to give me fundas be it related to my project, career or any other thing. My mentor would always motivate me and guide me as to how to look towards the problem statement with a more analytical view. I have learnt innumerable things throughout this internship and listing all of them in one blog is just not possible.In the end, I am glad that I was able to contribute to the project. The most important thing that I have learnt is that whatever you do, give it your best shot. Try to pitch in new ideas/methods for your project and interact with the people as much as possible. They are obviously more experienced and it\u2019ll definitely develop your social skills. Look at this internship as a golden opportunity and make the most of it in every way possible"

I am a student of Industrial and Systems Engineering department enrolled in its dual degree course with M.Tech. in Financial Engineering. I am a boarder of Patel Hall of Residence.My previous internships include research internship at Indian School of Business, Hyderabad in the field of Quantitative Finance and served as a research affiliate at the University of Huddersfield, England in Supply Chain Management with Financial risk measures.\n\nSelection Procedure:\n\nIt has 2 stages. First, the online test which includes questions from data interpretation and verbal reasoning. Shortlist depends upon the performance in the online test as well as CV. The second stage has Personal Interviews. I had appeared for 5 different rounds with different panels. First 2 were for checking Quantitative Aptitude followed by 1 round on CV. One with HR and finally with the Director.\n\nHow to prepare for them:\n\nYou can prepare for Quantitative Attitude from the book named \u201cHeard on the Street\u201d. In Finance, basic topics like Capital Market, Money Market, basic financial instruments and their derivatives, and Risk measures can be covered. Probability and Statistics in Engineering by Williams W. Hines is a good source for the foundation of Probability and Statistics.\n\nYour Project Details:\n\nI have worked with Quantitative Investment Solutions(QIS) team at DBC. My project was based on the interest rates market and the forex market. I have studied the research and backtested 2 different strategies to form portfolios for investors like pension funds and asset managers. I was supporting theLondon desk of the QIS business. I was constantly in touch with my onshore team for my project discussion. Along with my project, I was involved in helping the team members in their day to day activities like calculating risk/return attribution and generating market data. I have also worked onautomating the return attribution to reduce the time(cost) and increase efficiency. Majorly my work was on python and a little bit on MS excel.\n\nCompany Culture:\n\nDB offers a very structured internship in the field of Investment Banking. We were allotted a Project Guide, a Mentor, and a buddy for project work guidance. They were easily available on the floor which helped me a lot to solve my problems at the earliest. There were various information sessions by the top management for the interns in which they used to discuss their involvement, their desk works, and the future opportunities. They could also explain to us some basics on financial markets. On top of all these, DBC has almost all businesses that Deutsche Bank offers. The best thing about interning at DBC is the opportunity to interact with people from all of these businesses. It is very important to get to know about all of it before you select your profile/job.\n\nAccording to you who should ideally apply for the intern:\n\nAnyone who wants to give Investment Banking a try. This internship does not require any prior knowledge in Finance. But having it definitely helps a lot during the internship.\n\nAnd what advice will you give to them:\n\nStart preparing hard on the topics mentioned. Be aware of the recent news in this field. If you claim it, they gonna ask you in the interview."

I interned at Goldman Sachs in the Risk division this summer.\n\nSelection Procedure:\n\nFirst, there was a written test consisting of some basic programming questions and some objective type questions on Prob. Stats. and basic CS. It was followed by 4 rounds of interviews, which was based on Probability and Stats. and some puzzles. I didn\u2019t have any programming interviews as such.\n\nHow to prepare for them:\n\nI think one can do well in the interview with some revision of the basics of Probability Statistics and having some practice on the same topic.Doing some Coding practice would also help a lot, in general. Geeks for Geeks is a good resource for both in my opinion.\n\nYour Project Details:\n\nMy project consisted of creating a new benchmarking model for the existing CVA(credit valuation) calculation system using Neural Networks. It consisted of a lot of math and also needed programming skills. I liked my project because, instead of working on some dummy project, I got to work on a project which I personally felt had a lot of scope for impact.\n\nCompany Culture:\n\nThe most amazing thing about the company is its culture. The people are really amazing, they are very approachable and friendly as well.

It consists of 4\u20135 rounds of panel interviews following a CV shortlist procedure, apart from a simple test process. The test itself is pretty simple with Quantitative Reasoning and English sections. Once the CV is shortlisted, the interviews take place along with the other companies and take up to 3 hours to get through.\n\nHow to prepare for them:\n\nFirstly, ONE DOES NOT NEED A FINANCE BACKGROUND TO SECURE AN INTERNSHIP AT DB. This is the most important point to be kept in mind. They just see how well you have done whatever you put on your CV and how they feel you would fit into their work environment. While this sort of decision is subjective at best, it allows you to be yourself through the interview process. At the same time, some proficiency in Probability, Statistics and basic Quant ability is expected of the candidate (an entire round is usually dedicated to this aspect). In short, be confident of what you have done and you should do fairly well in the DB selection process.\n\nYour Project Details:\n\nI worked on FX Hedging Methodologies while at DB. I am, however, unable to disclose more about the same.\n\nCompany Culture:\n\nThe Desk that I worked with was Fixed Income and Currencies: APAC Region, which consists of people from various backgrounds who do a variety of work, which makes it an excellent learning opportunity for someone who\u2019s just delving into the world of finance. They are a really fun, yet at the same time, an insightful bunch with whom I spent a really great 2 months. There\u2019s a pretty good work-life balance which allows you to enjoy not just the internship but the city of Mumbai as well so that\u2019s a plus.\n\nAccording to you who should ideally apply for the intern:\n\nI feel everyone should apply for this Company because there is no right or wrong \u201cprofile\u201d, per say. If you be draft your CV well enough, you should get good shortlists, although that is subjective and the only thing that may stop you short. However, upon making it to the interview rounds, as long as you\u2019re candid with them about your expectations from the internship, there isn\u2019t much that should stop you from making it.\n\nAnd what advice will you give to them:\n\nI don\u2019t have any DB-specific advice, to be honest. However, to everyone sitting for an internship, be it their third or fourth year, I strongly recommend you to try out a new field; something you haven\u2019t done in the past. College is the only time you get to explore and I hope you make the best of it.Best of luck and cheers!"

        "content": "FORESIGHT(2019): Summer Internship Nomura\u2019s Global markets | Pallav Bhutani\n\n--\n\nListen\n\nBrief Introduction:\n\nHi! My name is Pallav Bhutani. I am a final year undergraduate student of the department of Chemical Engineering (enrolled in its dual degree course :P). I had the chance to work in Nomura\u2019s Global markets division during these summers. Global Markets is the \u2018trading side\u2019 of Nomura. Powai office is integrated with various trading desks most importantly Asia except Japan(AeJ) and Europe.\n\nSelection Procedure:\n\nHow to prepare for them:\n\nFor the group discussion, all you can do is form groups ideally a week before Day 1 and practice them, take feedback from the groupmates, work on it a practice again. Other companies that have a GD are ITC & HUL.For the interviews, as already mentioned above, it an interviewee led interview. The interviewers want to see your strong points and the understanding you have of the same. So if you try to impress them by your background in finance, make sure you can answer any question they throw at you (Not having a finance background helped in my case :P). They can pick up any word you have mentioned in your CV and have a 10 min discussion on it. Be clear on why you want to do finance and why Nomura is the perfect match for you. For guesstimates, you can see a couple of videos on Youtube. No need to practice for weeks but have an understanding of what it is.\n\nYour Project Details:\n\nNomura\u2019s internship program is very well structured and a lot of importance is given to the interns there (owing to the fact that they hire recent graduates only from this program). The 2-month internship is equally divided into two teams. The work might vary from team to team. There is no single project, interns have the chance to work on multiple projects.I had the privilege to work in \u2018Equity Linked Strategies\u2019 where my work was to make multiple analysis tools related to finding outliers in various equities, convertible bonds and options. One model I made was related to delta hedging of convertible bonds and various strategies that can be used for the same. One other project was related to portfolio screening and backtesting.Both the projects were in sync with the traders in HK/Europe.In my next month, I worked in \u2018Asset-Backed Securities\u2019 strategy team. One interesting fact about the team is that it was Lehman Brothers\u2019 ABS team before Nomura (Watch Big Short if you can\u2019t relate). My work in ABS was to construct a screening model to find outlier ABS deals that have the possibility for rating up-gradation/degradation.Nomura also added a sideline competition for the interns which we took very seriously. The aim was to invest 1Million USD in various indices (S&P 500, Shanghai Composite etc), safe havens, crude oil etc and get the most returns at the end of the intern. As a matter of fact, our final presentation was 90% on this competition. We worked on this on weekends and absolutely loved it.\n\nCompany Culture:\n\nNomura is a Japanese bank and you can see the Japanese culture in the way work is carried out. Nomura is a very respected investment bank that takes a lot of pride in its employees. Nomura gives a lot of power to its employees, the learning curve is very steep. A lot of focus is given to the interns. There will be multiple networking lunches and high teas with the leadership team of Nomura which consists of all EDs and MDs. The exposure an intern at Nomura gets is immense. The culture is to meet as many people as you can on the floor. You are considered as an employee during your internship, I was on a call with a trader. It will not be unusual to be on a call with a client if your team does that.\n\nAccording to you who should ideally apply for the intern:\n\nAnyone and everyone. It is a misconception that Nomura hires only CFAs/FRMs or for that matter people with a background in finance. I had absolutely no exposure in finance. I clearly mentioned it in the interview. They understood and asked me on the work I have done in campus. They do not need finance guys. They need smart people that can be given responsibility. Finance you can learn, the person you are you cannot change. Finance is no rocket science and internships are for learning, Nomura understands that. So make use of this learning opportunity and start preparing for the process with grit.\n\nAnd what advice will you give to them:\n\nBe clear in what you want to do. The last thing an interviewer wants to see is a person in two minds. Have a clear understanding of why you want to do finance if you don\u2019t have previous experience in finance. Be confident in the work you have done on campus and know everything about your past work experience. Be completely honest with the interviewers, no need to overexaggerate at any point. But definitely, know about the happenings in the finance world like US-China trade war, US- Iran tensions, Fed rate cuts etc, this will give added talking points."

I am a third year undergraduate student from the department of Mechanical Engineering enrolled in its 4 year BTech course of manufacturing science and engineering. I did my internship at Nomura Structured Financial Services in the Global Markets division in the summer of 2019.\n\nSelection Procedure:\n\nThe process begins by applying to Nomura with one of your 3 CVs made on the CDC website. There is no hard cutoff on the basis of CG but it pays to be above 8. After you are selected on the basis of your CV, you have to appear for a GD. The topics of the GD can be anything ranging from abstract analogies for the professional world to contemporary issues. Post the GDs, there are 2 technical interviews followed by an HR interview.\n\nHow to prepare for them:\n\nDuring the technical interviews, it does pay to have some basic knowledge of financial securities, however, there is no hard and fast rule. The best thing would be to back up your CV such that you can explain the learnings from virtually every experience written on your CV. It\u2019s also beneficial to have a decent idea about guesstimates and brain teasers. \u201cHeard on the street\u201d is a good book to prepare for the same.\n\nYour Project Details:\n\nApart from a lot of ad hoc and BAU work, my main project was creating a tool that could calculate Initial Margin requirements for derivative transactions underlying Bespoke CSAIDs both using SIMM and Schedule IM models. The work mostly revolved around excel and also some VBA so it does help a lot to have some decent understanding of Excel beforehand.\n\nCompany Culture:\n\nThe company culture is pretty chilled out where everyone from the analyst sitting beside you to an MD overseas lend an ear to help you with your work. You are expected to dress in formals as they have a pretty strict dress code. The best part, however, is that the timings are flexible as long as you complete the work assigned to you. The amiability and approachability of senior management is a great motivator and weekends are usually as awesome as you can imagine. Overall, the culture is amazing.\n\nAccording to you who should ideally apply for the intern:\n\nThis internship is perfect for anyone looking to get an idea of how the finance industry operates irrespective of whether you have any prior knowledge or experience in finance. The company provides a plethora of reading material to learn on your own pace once selected and you even learn on the job hence that is not an issue. Someone who already is interested in finance shoulddefinitely apply because the practical knowledge that you\u2019d gain is in no way achieved with any course, certification you may have already done.\n\nAnd what advice will you give to them:\n\nStay calm during the technical rounds. The aim of the interviewers is in no way to intimidate or grill you. The more interested you can keep them and steer the interview into a conversation, the better your chances. Stay to the point during explaining your past experiences and try to weave your CV into a story wherein you show how an internship or a project reinforced your belief about joining the industry. Most importantly, just try and smile. It does wonders!"

ITC is one of India\u2019s foremost private sector companies with a market capitalization of INR 3.74 trillion and a turnover of INR 550 billion. ITC is rated among the World\u2019s Best Big Companies, Asia\u2019s \u2018Fab 50\u2019 and the World\u2019s Most Reputable Companies by Forbes magazine and among India\u2019s Most Valuable Companies by Business Today. ITC has a diversified presence in FMCG, Hotels, Paperboards & Specialty Papers, Packaging, Agri-Business, and Information Technology.\n\nSelection Procedure:\n\nFor the students of top-notch colleges (IITs, IIMs etc.), a program names KITES is launched every year. The selection procedure of ITC is a bit comprehensive.\n\nHow to prepare for them:\n\nThe answers to the fields asked in the internship application form should be honest. For Psychometric Test, the key is to read the questions carefully, you\u2019ll find same questions asked in different manners multiple times just to check the mental stability of your mind. For the GD round, my advice is to search for a few case GD topics online and practice with your friends on the same. This will help a lot during the final GD. I firm grip on core subjects (the applicant should be ready with 2 strong subjects) and conceptual clarity is required. Knowledge about the accomplishments written in the internship form (like the past internship work, academic project) is must for the interviews.\n\nYour Project Details:\n\nI was working in the Agri-Business Division of ITC at Guntur, Andhra Pradesh where my major project was to Digitalise a Spice Processing Facility up to Industry 4.0 standards. This was a critical project as a capital expenditure of about 175 Cr INR was at stake. The project demanded thorough knowledge of Spice Processing as well Digitalisation Trends being adopted across industries so I planned and visited many ITC/non-ITC plants located in different parts of the country including Bangalore, Pune, Chirala etc. This was a really enriching experience and the best part is all your travel expenses are handled by ITC itself. I also contacted international vendors through video conferences for fixing deals and budget finalisation. For these jobs, I was working at the Agri-Business Division HQ at Guntur. Apart from this I was also assigned 2 minor projects related to facility\u2019s construction phase.\n\nCompany Culture:\n\nThe work culture at ITC is very professional. The corporate exposure that one gets at ITC is unmatchable in my opinion. People treat you equal to themselves and give importance to your ideas/inputs instead of treating you like some students who are still studying. Each and every project is very well thought upon. You are given a feeling of ownership towards the project which makes you more dedicated towards it. The thing that I liked the most at ITC was \u201cAppreciation for Talent\u201d, people acknowledge your efforts for any job which makes you feel motivated to deliver more. Apart from this with a brand name like ITC attached with you, international firms and organisations respect your designation which also adds to your corporate profile for any future endeavours. For future interns, you\u2019ll enjoy a grand welcome party cum workshop during March/April for the Intern Summit at Bangalore in one of the finest Luxury-Collection Hotel of ITC (ITC Windsor).\n\nAccording to you who should ideally apply for the intern:\n\nIn my opinion, someone who wants to experience corporate life to the fullest, learn how big organisations work should definitely seek for an internship. Someone who wants to utilise the opportunity instead of enjoying 2 months away from home should seek for the internship. Someone who not only wants to learn but also make an impact by his/her contribution should definitely seek for an internship.\n\nAnd what advice will you give to them:\n\nWhen I got Guntur as my internship location, I was sad as it is not a very great city to chill out. But now I feel it does not matter at all; what matters at the end if the experience, knowledge and exposure that you take from the internship. Also, students focus on the high stipend that ITC pays; it is to be understood that if such a high amount is being paid the same amount of efforts should be visible from your side. Even if you contribute a little, they\u2019ll acknowledge your efforts and surely will offer you a PPO. Last thing, Keep Calm, SAB PEACE HOGA. Day-1/Day-10 kuch fark nahi padta. BE MOTIVATED!!"
