        "content": "FORESIGHT(2024) | Internship at Texas Instruments | Sanidhya Raj\n\n--\n\nListen\n\nHello, I hope you all are doing well! I am Sanidhya Raj, a soon-to-be fourth-year undergraduate student from the Department of Mathematics. I am from Patna, Bihar, and currently reside at MMM Hall of Residence. Last year, I received an offer from Texas Instruments for an embedded software engineering role.\n\n2. How did you get into Texas Instruments? What was the selection procedure?\n\nThe process began with the submission of my CV. The initial filter was an online test consisting of MCQ questions on aptitude, C/C++ fundamentals, OOPs, operating systems, and a few on electronics/hardware.\n\nNext was the interview round, which at Texas Instruments is straightforward as it consists of only one round, unlike other companies. In the first half of the interview, I was thoroughly questioned about my CV, focusing mainly on the projects I had listed. Since the interview was conducted online, I was asked to share my screen and code in C or C++. Basic questions from data structures and algorithms were asked, covering linked lists, bitwise operators, and sorting (2-Easy and 1-Medium level). Toward the end, they asked general HR questions I had prepared in advance.\n\n3. How to prepare for them?\n\nDuring the summer break, I interned and rigorously practiced DSA problems on leetcode. For theory, I referred to Algozenith and Striver. Additionally, I spent a day or two revising probability and statistics and solved some puzzles from GFG, as these are commonly asked in interviews, though not at Texas Instruments. I appeared for 6 interviews (3-Day 1 & 3-Day 2), and questions of varying difficulty from probability & statistics and puzzles were frequently asked. Spend more time practicing problems on graph algorithms and dynamic programming since they are more often asked. Consistency is the key. Just keep on grinding, and eventually, you\u2019ll make it.\n\n4. When did you start preparing for this role and according to you what is the ideal time for aspirants to begin their preparation?\n\nI began my preparation in May 2023, when my summer vacation started. However, I recommend starting earlier to ease the pressure towards the end. Regardless of when you begin, stay calm and devise your strategy, then work consistently according to it. The last two months are crucial, so use that time wisely.\n\n5. What difficulties did you face while preparing for this Company/Profile? How did you overcome them?\n\nKeeping a consistent schedule was no easy feat, especially when fatigue set in. Balancing an internship alongside my DSA preparation added another layer of difficulty. However, I chose not to panic and focused on doing as much as possible. Having a group of friends to discuss coding problems with was incredibly helpful; it kept me consistent and motivated.\n\n6. Are there any specific requirements such as department, CGPA, or other criteria for this position? Additionally, do certain PORs or EAAs enhance one\u2019s chances of securing this internship?\n\nTexas Instruments offers several roles, but only the embedded software engineering position is open for MA, IM, and CS. The other roles are limited to ECE/EE students. There is no specific CGPA cutoff, however, a higher CGPA is given priority. There is not much focus on the PORs.\n\n7. According to you, who should ideally apply for this job?\n\nSomeone with a passion for software development and an interest in electronics and hardware should ideally aim for this role.\n\n8. What are some of the major points you think would be valid to mention in your CV while targeting this profile?\n\nTI places significant emphasis on projects, making it essential to include strong technical projects on your CV. Half of the interview revolves around discussing these projects, so be thoroughly prepared for detailed questions on each one. A high CGPA or a strong awards and achievements section would be a cherry on the cake.\n\n9. Lastly, what advice would you like to give to the students aiming to grab CDC internships this year?\n\nMake sure you\u2019re well-prepared for a thorough CV grilling. Revise linked lists, DP, graphs, and probability & statistics well since they are quite frequently asked. There may be moments when you feel like giving up, but keep hustling. Remember hard work always pays!"

        "content": "FORESIGHT(2024) | Internship at Google | Shelly Aggarwal\n\n--\n\nListen\n\nHello everyone, I am Shelly Aggarwal, a pre-final year undergraduate at IIT Kharagpur enrolled in its B.Tech course of Instrumentation Engineering. I am a boarder of Mother Teresa Hall of Residence. I joined Google as a Software Engineering Intern this summer.\n\n2. How did you get into Google? What was the selection procedure?\n\nI got into Google through the Career Development Centre, IIT Kharagpur. The process consisted of an online assessment (on 15th July) and two rounds of interviews (on Day 1) -\n\na. Online Assessment-The online assessment consisted of two coding questions to be solved within a 60-minute time limit. There were multiple questions (around 5), all of medium-hard difficulty, which were randomly distributed among the students.\n\nThese were the questions I got in my assessment:- Median path: We were given a tree of n nodes, each with a value. We had to find the sum of the medians of all simple paths of odd length. I don\u2019t remember the details.- Hybrid maximum: Some hybrid sequence was given. An expression was also provided, calculating the difference between the sum of maximum values and the sum of the minimum values in the sequence. We had to find the maximum value of the expression for all possible sequences.\n\nI can\u2019t recall the other questions exactly, but this might be of some help:- Maximize collection of toys- Something related to Prime Paths in a grid using BFS\n\nAim to give your best in the oa. Even if you cannot solve both questions, it is absolutely fine. There are still chances of getting a shortlist since OA is one of many criteria for getting one, specifically for Google.\n\nb. Technical Rounds:There were two technical rounds. The first round was held a day before Day 1, called the preliminary round, and the other was on Day 1 if you get through Round 1. I was asked to code in a Google Doc, not a code editor, in both rounds. So, the focus is entirely on your conceptual understanding and logic and whether you can implement it. In both rounds, I was not asked any HR questions, not even my introduction.\n\nRound 1:The interviewer asked me three questions. The last two were a bit difficult versions of the previous question. The first question was easy and was based on a tree where alternate nodes had to be painted black and white. The next question was of medium difficulty, where I was asked to paint alternate levels in black and white. I found the last question challenging and could not optimize the time complexity. I don\u2019t exactly remember the previous question, but it was based on a similar concept, where painting the tree in an optimized way made it challenging. In all three questions, time complexity analysis was asked. It lasted for around 60 minutes.\n\nRound 2:I found this round simpler than the previous one. Again, I was not asked for any introduction or HR questions, and we jumped straight to problem solving. I was asked two questions and had to optimize the solution I provided in both. Both were based on strings and the basic concept was storing the frequency of the characters in a map. This round lasted for 30\u201340 minutes.\n\n3. How to prepare for them?\n\nWhen we talk specifically about Google, you just need to be strong in DSA. They don\u2019t generally ask anything apart from DSA. I would still advise you to be thorough with your CV as the interviewer might ask questions about any point they find interesting.\n\nThe most important part is DSA; practice as many questions as you can. Once you are comfortable solving questions of a particular difficulty level, increase the difficulty level. There are a plethora of online resources and platforms where you can practice. It was pretty overwhelming when I started preparation during the summer breaks, and I felt lost. Hence, I prepared from Algozenith and also solved questions on Leetcode. Binary search, two pointers, graphs, trees, and dynamic programming are the most important topics.\n\nAs for how many questions to solve, solve as many as you can. I cannot provide an exact number. Keep solving until you are comfortable with that topic or difficulty level. Many also ask how much time to dedicate to a single question. For medium-difficulty questions, give 20 minutes to formulate an approach, and if you cannot think of one, look for a few hints or a slight idea and try again. Initially, it might take 40 minutes, but eventually, try to solve them within 30 minutes. Also, it is okay to look at the solution; what is wrong is forgetting it later. Make a note of what the approach was and what the basic concept that you missed was. Also, try to give contests on Codeforces and CodeChef regularly for upskilling yourself.\n\n4. When did you start preparing for this role and according to you what is the ideal time for aspirants to begin their preparation?\n\nI started DSA preparation in January 2023, but due to the semester examinations and assignments, I could not prepare for it properly. I started a structured preparation during the summer breaks. But that is not recommended at all since it became very stressful. Start preparing for it as early as possible. Managing acads and coding simultaneously might become challenging, but practice DSA whenever possible. Whatever I did during my semester helped me immensely in escalating my preparation during summer breaks.\n\n5. What difficulties did you face while preparing for this Company/Profile? How did you overcome them?\n\nAs I mentioned earlier, it becomes very confusing amidst so many resources, and figuring out how to proceed becomes difficult. So, I took a course to structure my preparation. Also, I contacted seniors to clarify any doubts regarding the preparation for that profile. Moreover, keeping your motivation up always during your preparation is difficult. There were times when I had self-doubt and was unsure of the outcome. But it is important to remember that you are giving your best, and whatever has to happen will happen. Just give it your best shot!\n\n6. Are there any specific requirements such as department, CGPA, or other criteria for this position? Additionally, do certain PORs or EAAs enhance one\u2019s chances of securing this internship?\n\nGoogle was open for all circuital departments. As for PORs, they don\u2019t matter at all for an SDE role at Google. However, a high CGPA significantly increases your chances of getting a shortlist. Once you are shortlisted, you are judged solely based on your coding skills. This is not only true for Google, but generally, having a good CGPA always helps.\n\n7. According to you, who should ideally apply for this job?\n\nAnyone interested in development and enjoys coding can apply for this job.\n\n8. What are some of the major points you think would be valid to mention in your CV while targeting this profile?\n\nMention previous experiences, such as internships and projects you have worked on. Good contest ratings and academic achievements can distinguish your profile. Just be thorough with whatever you mention in your CV. If you are not confident about it and it gets reflected in your interview, it significantly reduces your chances of getting an offer.\n\n9. Lastly, what advice would you like to give to the students aiming to grab CDC internships this year?\n\nJust give it your best shot :).To be honest, I believe both hard work and luck play a significant factor in your getting a shortlist for a company. You cannot control the other one, so just focus on working hard; the rest will follow. The more we focus on the end result, the more stressed we are. So, just stay motivated and ask your seniors and peers for help if you are stuck. It\u2019s all about giving your consistent effort."

        "content": "FORESIGHT(2024) | Internship at Graviton Research Capital | Abhijeet Singh\n\n--\n\nListen\n\n1) Brief introduction and description of the offered role\n\nA) Hello everyone, I am Abhijeet Singh, a 4th-year undergraduate student of the Department of Computer Science and Engineering, enrolled in its Dual Degree course. I will be interning at Graviton Research Capital in the summer of 2023 as a software engineering intern.\n\n2) How did you get into GRAVITON RESEARCH CAPITAL LLP? What was the selection procedure?\n\nA) Graviton\u2019s selection process began with a 60-minute test comprising two questions: one on tree-based DFS and another on Bit Manipulation. Successfully solving both questions was required for shortlisting.\n\nThe interview consisted of two 30-minute technical rounds followed by a 15-minute HR round. The first technical round started with a coding question combining Dynamic Programming and Bit Manipulation, followed by a puzzle. The second round began with a problem with calculating expected values using the linearity of expectation principle. Subsequently, I was asked several questions on core computer science topics, primarily focusing on Deadlock and Synchronization in Operating Systems and Pipelining and Caching in Computer Organization and Architecture. The second round concluded with a question involving fundamental probability concepts.\n\nThe HR round had standard HR questions, and I was offered the position at the end of this round.\n\n3) How to prepare for them?\n\nA) To prepare effectively for a role like the one at Graviton, it\u2019s essential to build a strong foundation in both competitive programming (CP) and core computer science fundamentals. Start early with CP, focusing on key topics such as dynamic programming, graphs, and trees, and participate in contests on platforms like Codeforces and AtCoder. This practice will enhance your problem-solving skills and help you perform well under the time constraints of coding tests.\n\nAdditionally, deepen your knowledge of operating systems, computer architecture, and software engineering principles, particularly in areas like synchronization, pipelining, caching, and object-oriented programming. However, for B.Tech students, proficiency in software engineering topics is generally sufficient.\n\n4) When did you start preparing for this role and according to you what is the ideal time for aspirants to begin their preparation?\n\nA) I began my specific preparations for this role three months before the CDC internship process. However, I started competitive programming (CP) in my first year, which significantly aided my preparation. I strongly recommend starting CP as early as possible; early engagement allows ample time for practice, helping you reach a proficient level. Additionally, from my observation, those who start CP early often secure better offers during CDC internships.\n\n5) What difficulties did you face while preparing for this Company/Profile? How did you overcome them?\n\nA) Initially, I recognized my weaknesses in Dynamic Programming (DP). To overcome this, I tackled numerous DP problems on Codeforces and other websites.\n\nAdditionally, during the final three months before the CDC internship process, I sometimes felt demotivated. Fortunately, I was part of a study group of three people. Our regular discussions helped maintain our focus on our goals. This group was also instrumental in resolving doubts and bolstering my preparation.\n\n6) Are there any specific requirements such as department, CGPA, or other criteria for this position? Additionally, do certain PORs or EAAs enhance one\u2019s chances of securing this internship?\n\nA) Generally, HFTs are open only to students from circuital branches, and it\u2019s advisable to maintain a CGPA of 9 or above. However, in my experience with Graviton, CGPA did not seem to play a significant role. Additionally, holding positions of responsibility or excelling in extracurricular activities does not necessarily improve one\u2019s chances of securing an internship in HFTs.\n\n7) According to you, who should ideally apply for this job?\n\nA) Anyone with a keen interest in Computer Science fundamentals and curious about how these principles can be applied in the fast-paced world of high-frequency trading should consider applying for this job.\n\n8) What are some of the major points you think would be valid to mention in your CV while targeting this profile?\n\nA) For companies on days 1\u20132, a CV isn\u2019t usually critical. However, for HFT positions, it is beneficial to highlight your rankings in competitive programming competitions and your ratings on platforms like Codeforces and Codechef. Also, try to mention some good projects related to Computer Science in your CV.\n\n9) Lastly, what advice would you like to give to the students aiming to grab CDC internships this year?\n\nA) Try to make the best use of the three months before the CDC internship process; this can make a lot of difference. Try to remain calm during coding tests and strive to avoid errors in your implementations, as these can consume critical time needed for solving other problems. Don\u2019t be disheartened by a few poor performances in tests or interviews, as there will be a lot of opportunities. The CDC process is demanding, so remember to take care of yourself. Maintain faith and confidence in your abilities, and believe that you will secure a good offer in the end. Stay focused and resilient, even when things don\u2019t go as planned."

Brief introduction and description of the offered role\n\nHey Folks!\n\nMy name is Samay Sawal, I am a third-year Undergraduate student of the Department of Mathematics enrolled in its BS course of Mathematics and Computing. I am a border of Rajendra Prasad Hall of Residence. I am from Pune, Maharashtra.\n\nSome other things about me, I am the General Secretary at the International Relations Cell, and I targeted mainly software and data science roles in CDC.\n\nI joined Google this summer as a Software Engineering Intern in their Cloud Team.\n\n2. How did you get into Google? What was the selection procedure?\n\nStarting with the coding round Google had given everyone a window of around 4 to 5 hours (I cannot recall exactly) wherein you can give the test (on HackerEarth) of 1 hour during this window. The coding round had two questions - one was medium level while the other one was on the tougher side (probably tougher among all questions). I was able to solve 1 question completely and for the tougher question around ten out of the fourteen test cases. There were many sets of questions, and it was pure luck as to which set you got.\n\nSo, this time Google had changed their selection procedure, though the number of rounds remained the same (i.e. 2) but they had a screening round before day 1 on Friday itself where they took a technical round. Out of all the shortlisted candidates, some were now shortlisted for the technical round on Day 1.\n\n\u25cf In the screening round, I was asked around questions, one was a simple question based on an array, one was on the implementation of heap sort and one was based on graph traversing which I\u2019d say was a medium to hard-level question. I was able to solve all the questions and by EOD I got to know that I had been shortlisted for the Technical Round on Day 1.\n\n\u25cf On Day 1, Interviews started at 10 a.m. and I got my Interview call around 11:30 a.m. as I had other Interviews lined up as well. For this technical round, I was asked three questions all based on Graphs alongside the Time Complexity and the Memory Complexity. While the first question was pretty easy, subsequent follow-ups were a little on the tougher side. I was able to code all three problems but faced issues with the time complexity and memory complexity of the first two questions (The interviewer was kind enough to teach me a bit about TC and MC :) )\n\nI was pretty satisfied with both my technical rounds, but yet had butterflies in my stomach if I would get the role or not, and by the end of the day I got to know that I had been offered by Google for the SWE role.3. How to prepare for them?\n\nEssentially the entire selection process only involved DSA and nothing else honestly!\n\nI had followed Algozenith from the very start (around August of 2023) but did not do much during the semesters, I did DP in December and then covered Graphs in May. I covered the rest topics like Segment Tree, Binary Search, Bit Manipulation, etc, during the semester only. Other topics like Trie, Linked List, and all I covered in June. I saw that DP and Graph were important topics, especially for Google I read articles that Graph is the most common topic for questions, and thus I did Graph extensively, from At Coder, CSES, and ALgozenith Questions.\n\nI gave regular contests on CF, CC, Leetcode, and AtCoder. Alongside this, I believe the regular contests organized by GOC are very important, and not only the live contest but past year's contest as well. I also did Interview Bit but wasn't able to finish (but as recommended by my seniors Interview Bit should be done at least twice completely). Apart from this for Coding, I did not follow anything else as Algozenith was exhaustive enough.\n\nApart from DSA I also revised Probability and Statistics from my class notes and solved questions from the book \u201c50 Challenging Problems in Probability\u201d. I did Object object-oriented programming from Algozenith.\n\nFor puzzles, I only followed Brain Stellar, which helped me a lot in my Interview with Nomura for their Quants and Strats Position. I believe that the summer vacation is very important and you should plan your day accordingly so that everything is covered.\n\n4. When did you start preparing for this role and according to you what is the ideal time for aspirants to begin their preparation?\n\nIf you are planning to get a Software or Quant role, DSA is very important. I started doing DSA early but had a lot of gaps in between, so I wasn\u2019t able to have a proper grasp, maybe this might be different for you, but in my experience, I believe you should continue doing DSA without breaks (at least a little) so that you stay in touch. I will suggest starting as early as possible but even if you did not, at least cover basic topics like Sorting Algorithms, Binary Search, Graph, DP, etc.\n\n5. What difficulties did you face while preparing for this Company/Profile? How did you overcome them?\n\nThe biggest challenge for me was DSA only\u00a0:(\n\nAlthough I was doing a lot, I was not satisfied with my results in contests. I kept going and one-to-one meetings with the instructor at Algozenith boosted my morale a lot.\n\n6. Are there any specific requirements such as department, CGPA, or other criteria for this position? Additionally, do certain PORs or EAAs enhance one's chances of securing this internship?\n\nThe SWE Role of Google was open for only circuital branches, so yes Department plays a major role, coming to CGPA I believe CGPA is important, as it does play an important role in getting shortlisted for different roles in different companies, it is a major factor alongside the branch.\n\nComing to PORs, in my opinion, I don\u2019t believe it is important in SDE roles. I did not include my IR Cell POR in my SDE CV on the CDC portal. Though they can be a good filler if you have space in your CV, and the same goes with EAA.\n\n7. According to you, who should ideally apply for this job?\n\nAnyone eligible\u00a0:), if you are really into software development, you should apply for an internship role in such companies, because there is a lot to learn here and leverage the experiences of full-time employees here.\n\n8. What are some of the major points you think would be valid to mention in your CV while targeting this profile?\n\nI believe many Day 1 companies for SDE roles (exceptions like Goldman Sachs) do not really grill you on your resume or even have a glance at your resume. But for that matter, I believe some of the major points that companies look into your CV is maybe course work (at least for me during the Goldman Sachs Interview), apart from this some internships and projects that you have done should be included and skills you have gained up till now. My seniors always used to say to me, \u201cCV me white space nahi Diana cha hiya zyada\u201d. So try to fill your CV with all the self-projects or internships you have done, your achievements, etc.\n\n9. Lastly, what advice would you like to give to the students aiming to grab CDC internships this year?\n\nThe entire process might be a little overwhelming, even I was very anxious even after getting 6 shortlists on Day 1, but just hang in there, your efforts will pay off.\n\nNow especially for students aiming for SDE roles, be thorough with all the concepts of DSA, and try to solve interview bit as many times as you can alongside all the contests that GOC has conducted to date (there are very good PYQs which will help you a lot). Probability and Statistics are very important as they directly ask you questions from this subject (I was asked in Nomura and Morgan Stanley). Solve puzzles from Brain Stellar (I was asked a medium-level puzzle from Brain Stellar in my Nomura interview).\n\nAll the best!Keep faith in yourself, We all know you will do well \ud83d\ude03"

        "content": "FORESIGHT(2024) | Internship at Quadeye | Atishay Jain\n\n--\n\nListen\n\n1)Brief introduction and description of offered role\n\nHello everyone, I am Atishay Jain, a fourth-year UG student from the Department of Computer Science and Engineering, IIT Kharagpur. I am thrilled to share that I've successfully secured the role of Systems Intern at Quadeye. Getting this opportunity is a dream for many, and Quadeye is known for its demanding selection process and high standards, making this achievement particularly significant for me. I'd like to share insights into the selection process, the role itself, and my preparation strategy to help others aiming for similar opportunities. The Systems Intern position at Quadeye involves collaboration with software and quantitative professionals. Interns are expected to engage in both technical and business projects, gather requirements, define project scopes, present plans, and propose future project optimizations. A significant part of the job is writing highly optimized, scalable code in line with best practices.\n\n2) How did you get into Quadeye? What was the selection procedure?\n\nThe selection process at Quadeye is notably concise and selective. Only students from circuital departments such as Computer Science, Electrical Engineering, etc., with a CGPA of 9 or above, are eligible to apply. The company bypasses the traditional online assessment and opts for direct CV-based shortlisting, followed by personal interviews. This approach underscores the importance of maintaining a strong academic record and crafting an impressive CV. Additionally, the interview assesses your understanding of core concepts and your problem-solving approach. If you need insights into the exact questions asked, feel free to reach out to me via email at atishay@kgpian.iitkgp.ac.in.\n\n3) How to prepare for them?\n\nDespite Quadeye being one of my dream and target companies, my preparation wasn\u2019t specifically tailored for it. It revolved around general good practices such as masteringData Structures and Algorithms (DSA) and the principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). Interestingly, I didn't engage much in Competitive Programming (CP) since it wasn't to my liking. Instead, I focused on solving problems on platforms like LeetCode and InterviewBit and revisited core concepts in Operating Systems, Networks, and OOPs.\n\n4) When did you start preparing for this role and according to you what is the ideal time for aspirants to begin their preparation?\n\nThe ideal time to start preparing for this role is whenever you feel ready to tackle it. Being from the Computer Science Department, my preparation began from the first year of my college only. I did courses on Algorithms, Operating Systems, Networks, Software Engineering, etc, which laid the foundation of my preparation. But, the serious preparation began only during the vacations before the internship season when I solved numerous DSA problems and refreshed my understanding of the core concepts. For those outside the CS department, consider taking similar courses as electives or self-studying using online resources.\n\n5) What difficulties did you face while preparing for this Company/Profile? How did you overcome them?\n\nThe primary challenge I faced while preparing for this role was managing my time effectively, a common issue for many. Balancing the preparation with a research internship during the vacation period was particularly tough. Time management is crucial; there is no escape from this, and it's important to prioritize effectively to make room for what truly matters. Additionally, I struggled with a lack of interest in Competitive Programming (CP). Although it's often recommended by mentors and essential for many, it didn't suit my style. Despite attempting to participate in contests on platforms like CodeForces, I couldn't sustain my interest and opted instead to practice on other platforms. However, it's important to note that CP remains a vital component of preparing for tech roles, even if it wasn't the right fit for me.\n\n6) Are there any specific requirements such as department, CGPA, or other criteria for this position? Additionally, do certain PORs or EAAs enhance one's chances of securing this internship?\n\nFor the System Engineering Intern role at Quadeye, there are specific eligibility criteria that I've previously outlined. Candidates must be students from the CS, EE, ECE, or MnC departments and have a CGPA of 9 or higher. Since the selection process does not include an online assessment, it is essential that your resume highlights significant projects, internships, and achievements to ensure shortlisting. In my view, positions of responsibility (PORs) and extra-academic activities (EAA) generally hold less weight in the application unless they are exceptionally prestigious.\n\n7) According to you, who should ideally apply for this job?\n\nAs previously noted, this position demands a robust understanding of data structures, algorithms, and object-oriented programming, along with the capability to write highly optimized code. If you possess these skills and are interested in entering the high-frequency trading (HFT) sector, this role could be an excellent fit for you. In my opinion, anyone who meets the eligibility criteria should consider applying for this opportunity.\n\n8) What are some of the major points you think would be valid to mention in CV while targeting this profile?\n\nTo improve your likelihood of landing this internship, ensure your resume stands out. Maintain a high CGPA and feature projects that demonstrate your capabilities across different domains. Highlight any academic achievements you\u2019ve attained during your college career. Additionally, previous internship experiences can be a significant advantage, particularly for dual-degree students. What distinguished my application were my JEE Rank, my internship experience at the University of Alberta, and, of course, my projects.\n\n9) Lastly, what advice would you like to give to the students aiming to grab CDC internships this year?\n\nFor students targeting an internship this year, focusing on traditionally crucial areas such as Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA), Competitive Programming, and Object-Oriented Programming (OOPs) is essential. These are foundational for preparing for a software engineering role at any company. For those aiming for a Systems role like mine, a solid grasp of computer science fundamentals is imperative. If you're interested in a Quant role, a deep understanding of probability and the ability to compute quickly is critical. Similarly, a ML role requires another skill set. Securing a Systems Internship at a prestigious firm like Quadeye requires dedication, strategic preparation, and a good understanding of your strengths and interests. Remember, it's essential to not just fit into a role but find one that fits you. Aim high, prepare well, and stay true to your interests. Preparation for such roles is a marathon, not a sprint. Take small, consistent steps in your preparation and maintain a balanced approach without overwhelming yourself. Keep pushing forward, and you'll find your efforts paying off. Good luck!"

        "content": "FORESIGHT(2024) | Internship at Oracle | Aryan Kumar\n\n--\n\nListen\n\n1) Brief Introduction and description of offered role.\n\nI\u2019m Aryan Kumar, an undergraduate student in the Industrial and Systems Engineering department, pursuing a dual degree course. I sat for the CDC Internship drive and will have my internship in the Software Development role at Oracle. I\u2019m a boarder of JCB Hall.\n\n2) How did you get into Oracle? What was the selection procedure\n\nCoding Round: The first stage was a 90-min online coding test. The test comprised 2 coding questions and 20 MCQs. I would estimate the coding question complexity to be medium to hard leetcode but both are tricky and MCQs are normally based on puzzles and code snippets. I did quite well in the test \u2014100% of test cases passed for both questions and was moderately confident about expecting a shortlist.\n\nShortlisting Criteria: Shortlists were announced based on test performance. If you did all questions of the test then you might be shortlisted based on department or CGPA.Interview: Oracle comes with a total of 8 people, having 6 interviewers and 2 HR. All interview round was offline. All the round of interview was 1-1. I was the only person who had been shortlisted from the non-circuital department, that\u2019s why I had 3-technical rounds and 1-HR rounds but circuital people have only 2-technical and 1-HR rounds.Round 1: I was a bit confused at the beginning when I had to introduce myself because I felt really nervous. This was my first time having a one-on-one interview in person, which made things even harder. As a result, I had trouble speaking clearly because I was unsure of myself. Thankfully, the interviewer kindly offered me some water, which gave me a short break and helped me calm down. After that, being in the interviewer's friendly presence made me feel more comfortable.To assess my technical acumen, I was provided with a pen and a set of A4-sized sheets to transcribe the code from the '#include' statement to the 'return 0' statement within the main function. It's noteworthy that I was not allowed to utilize function snippets, a caveat unique to my circumstance as someone with a non-circuit background.During our talk, the interviewer asked me questions based on binary trees, using trees in dynamic programming, and topological sorting. They also wanted to know about my past internships. What made it interesting was that I had to figure out and write the solutions for these coding problems on paper right then and there. I'd never done that before, so it was quite tough. But as we continued talking and I got more comfortable with the interviewer, my nervousness started to fade away. It was surprising how smoothly this happened, and I found it easier to handle the challenges that came up.\n\nRound 2: This round was the same as the previous one, I had to write the coding question\u2019s answer on paper. This round was a bit tough than the previous one where all the question was standard type like finding the sum in the range of each query using segment tree, knapsack dp with binary search, and standard bitmask dp(leetcode hard problem). Writing each question\u2019s code from scratch was the only difficult part of this round. The interviewer also asked me more about my CV and my college courses. It was like they were asking me to explain what I had done before.\n\nRound 3: This round was completely harder of all. I would estimate the question complexity to span 1400\u20131600 Codeforces ratings or so, the questions were definitely of a slightly higher level than the average CDC coding interviews that season. All questions need attention.\n\n\u201cAll these three rounds had taken around 60-70 minutes each. So having patience is required.\u201d\n\nRound 4(HR): My starting question was \u201cIn my world of computer science, how can I help some non-circuital guy\u201d. I answered gently and shared my experience in three internships in web development along with what I learned from them. He seemed pleased with my response. I also mentioned that I'm good at OOPs (which stands for Object-Oriented Programming). After all the technical questions, he asked about my day and the company. We had a casual chat that lasted around 25-30 minutes.\n\n3) How to prepare for them?\n\nHere are some ideas to help you prepare for interviews at software companies on day-1 and day-2. Please follow these tips\n\n1. During your winter vacation (December), take a course called Algozenth - 201. If you're new to programming concepts like the 'printf' statement in the C language, start from scratch and build your foundation in this one month. Even if you've taken the course before, it's a good way to reinforce your skills.\n\n2. During the summer vacation, which is around 60-80 days, start working on LeetCode problems once you've completed about 40-50% of the Algozenith - 201 courses. Focus on dynamic programming and graph-related problems. Aim to solve at least 100-150 (dp + graph) LeetCode questions to become proficient.\"Before watching the DP and graph videos from Algozenith, make sure to watch the videos on YouTube by 'Strive' for both DP and graphs (highly recommended).\"\n\n3. As you complete around 20% of the Algozenith course, begin participating in the ABC contest (AtCoder Beginner Contest) held every Saturday at 5:30 PM. The first four questions are relatively easier, while the last four require more attention. If you can't solve a problem during the contest, try working on it after the contest (**very important).\n\n4. In the final weeks leading up to interviews, learn Computer Science concepts related to Object-Oriented Programming (OOPs). Watch lectures 6 to 18 of the 'C++ by Saurabh Shukla' series and practice all the OOPs questions on InterviewBit (there are about 50 multiple-choice questions). If you have time, you can also explore subjects like Operating Systems (OS), Databases (DBMS), and Networking for additional knowledge. \u201cHaving a strong grasp of CS fundamentals, especially OOPs, is crucial.\"\n\n4) What difficulties did you face while preparing for this Company/Profile? How did you overcome this problem?\n\nI didn\u2019t face many problems, but I noticed that many people started preparing late. Due to this, they were still polishing their CP skills during the tests instead of targeted interview prep which that time should ideally be reserved for. So, it\u2019s best to follow the recommended early preparation, which should be enough for people with average skills.\n\n5) According to you, who should ideally apply for this job?\n\nThe way they choose people is more focused on competitive programming(CP). If you've done it before and enjoy coding, you have an advantage.\n\n6) Any specific advice you want to give to the junta sitting for internships this year?\n\nHey CDC folks, I know the road ahead might look hard. But believe in your effort \u2013 it will pay off. If you're not from a circuit background and don't get picked by a company right away, don't get discouraged. Your hard work won't go unseen. Every day, you'll see the results of your determination. Even I didn\u2019t get any shortlisted in day-1 companies. I was quite frustrated with the way the shortlisting criteria were being used for some day-1 companies where I did 100% in tests. Oracle was the only company that I got shortlisted for day-2. So, 1 shortlist and 1 chance of an interview will be sufficient if you did hard work.\"Have faith in getting a chance, drop your \u201cbt\u201d for sure.\"\n\n7) Kindly attach your resume. What are some of the major points you think would be valid to mention in your CV while targeting this profile? (any specific suggestions you would like to make?)\n\nList all your internships, projects, and achievements clearly in bold on your CV. Be ready to talk about them confidently and warmly. CV discussions are important to understand your past experiences, so make sure you can confidently explain and impress the interviewer with what you've done."

        "content": "FORESIGHT(2024) | Internship at Mastercard | Khushi Agrawal |\n\n--\n\nListen\n\n1) Brief introduction and description of offered role.\n\nHey, you all! I am Khushi Agrawal, a pre-final year undergraduate student from the Department of Electrical Engineering, enrolled in the B.Tech course for Instrumentation Engineering. I am a resident of Sister Nivedita Hall of Residence and hail from Bhilai, Chhattisgarh. I received an offer from Mastercard on Day \u2014 3 of the CDC internship drive for a Software Development Engineering role, and I will be working with the Tech (Payments and Networks) team this summer.\n\n2) How did you get into Mastercard? What was the selection procedure?\n\nFirstly, we had an Online Assessment round of 60 mins at Nalanda. It consisted of two easy-level coding questions. Despite their simplicity, they included some critical test cases. I managed to solve one question completely, but I recall one test case not passing in the other question. Nevertheless, I qualified for the interview round scheduled for Day 3.\n\nThere were two interview rounds, both conducted online via one-on-one video calls, but we had to go to Nalanda for the interviews.\n\nIn the first round, the interviewer asked me to introduce myself and provide a quick overview of the projects listed on my resume. This was followed by 2\u20133 questions about my research internship and the SWG website development I had mentioned. Then came some behavioral questions such as: Why Instrumentation Engineering? What are your future academic-related plans? What is one thing you wish you could have contributed to as a tech-savvy individual but couldn\u2019t? The interviewer was quite calm throughout the process and didn\u2019t ask overly challenging questions. Thus, the first round concluded smoothly.\n\nI was asked to wait for 10 minutes before being directed to join another meet link for the second round. I began with my introduction again. Then, the interviewer asked me a few CV-related questions, to which I responded to the best of my ability. After that, he presented a problem statement: there are emails of four categories arriving randomly in the inbox, and you need to classify them according to their category. How would you approach this? Initially, I answered using a data structure logic, thinking it was a DSA question. However, it turned out to be an ML-related question, so my response wasn\u2019t very apt. He then moved on to ask the difference between Red-Black trees and Binary trees in data structures and concluded by asking what I know about Mastercard. The second round was completed, and after a few minutes, I was informed that I had been selected.\n\n3) How to prepare for them?\n\nPreparation for SDE role follows a focused and a one-way path: becoming well-versed in Data Structures and practicing questions consistently. I purchased a self-paced DSA course from GeeksforGeeks, which covered all data structures in a systematic and easy-to-understand manner, greatly aiding my theoretical understanding. Additionally, there are various YouTube channels like Luv Babbar and Take U Forward that provide detailed explanations, which were quite helpful.\n\nFor practice, platforms such as LeetCode, AtCoder, InterviewBit, and the CSES Problem Set are invaluable. In particular, I find Codeforces to be the best platform for competitive programming, as it trains the brain to solve complex problems quickly, which ultimately helps during the Online Assessments. I primarily used InterviewBit for its curated questions that can be completed in a short time, covering almost all types of problems.\n\n4) When did you start preparing for this role and according to you what is the ideal time for aspirants to begin their preparation?\n\nI started preparing for this role in my second year. However, it was challenging to balance coding with the course curriculum and other commitments on a regular basis. As a result, the bulk of my preparation occurred in the last three months. These three months were crucial, affording ample time to focus solely on key aspects of the selected profile.\n\n5) What difficulties did you face while preparing for this Company/Profile? How did you overcome them?\n\nStaying on track with regular problem-solving was the biggest challenge in my preparation. I, along with my friend, created a basic schedule to cover all the important topics. Discussing challenges with others made it more interesting and kept us going. With so many applicants, it\u2019s tough to stand out and get picked for interviews, but at the end of the day, patience is the key to everything! :)\n\n6) Are there any specific requirements such as department, CGPA, or other criteria for this position? Additionally, do certain PORs or EAAs enhance one\u2019s chances of securing this internship?\n\nMastercard hired for two roles: SDE and Product Development Intern. The SDE role was open to students from circuital branches only, with no CGPA criteria, while the Product Development role was available to students from circuital + Mechanical peeps, with a CGPA requirement of 7.5. Although some companies do not specify a CGPA criterion, maintaining a decent CGPA significantly adds to the points and truly helps in the shortlisting process.\n\nWhile companies generally do not pay much emphasis on PORs and EAAs for this role, including them on your CV makes it look more substantial and noticeable.\n\n7) According to you, who should ideally apply for this job?\n\nAnyone who is interested in coding and enjoys digging deep into the technical aspects of anything can apply for this role. The majority of companies hire in this domain because of its demand and necessity, so it increases the chances of grabbing an opportunity at any recognized firm to a greater extent.\n\n8) What are some of the major points you think would be valid to mention in CV while targeting this profile?\n\nCVs usually go through the ATS machine, which helps with the shortlisting process. Some key points to keep in mind while you prepare your CVs are:\n\na) Present projects and internships concisely in 2\u20133 bullets, focusing more on numbers to increase the credibility of your accomplishments.\n\nb) Maintain a clean and well-structured format by keeping each point to a single line, spanning from left to right.\n\nc) Mention self-initiated or tech-related projects that are relevant for an SDE role, highlighting the tech stack utilized in projects.\n\nd) If you have a considerable rank in coding platforms, then it is worth mentioning.\n\ne) Avoid making spelling and grammatical mistakes since it lowers down the impression.\n\nA particular dedicated time is given for CV preparation, so one must seek feedback from seniors to ensure an up-to-the-mark presentation. Also, avoid mentioning those things which you are unaware of or are unsure of, as this can pose a problem during the interview process.\n\n9) Lastly, what advice would you like to give to the students aiming to grab CDC internships this year?\n\nThe CDC process can be overwhelming. It\u2019s not just about preparation but also about staying positive and confident till the time situation is in our favour. Rejections and seeing peers land internships early can bring self-doubts, but remember, good things take time. Keeping up the effort and having a resilient attitude, clubbed with support from friends and family, helps overcome challenges and breakdowns. And hey, there are plenty of opportunities out there, so don\u2019t be afraid to explore different paths. Just give it your best shot, and you\u2019ll find the right fit eventually. Keep your head up, and keep going!\n\nResults are generally not in our control, but persistence and a never-give-up attitude matter most in the long run. Wishing all the very best to everyone!"

This summer I will be interning at Sprinklr as a Product Engineer.\n\n2) How did you get into Sprinklr? What was the selection procedure?\n\nA) The selection process consisted of one online coding round and 3 rounds of interviews. In the coding round, we were given 90 minutes to solve 3 questions. The questions were based on binary search, dynamic programming optimization, and basic implementation. The questions were a mix of easy, medium, and difficult problems.\n\nIn the first technical round, the interviewer started by asking a classical DP question ( Count the no.of the subset with a given sum in an array ). I was asked to write the code on Google Docs and not on any code editor. As I had done a project on ML and the interviewer was also from an ML background, so he asked me some basic questions related to ML and related to my project and also asked me to code it. This interview lasted for about 40 min.\n\nIn the second technical interview, the interviewer asked me to give a 5-minute introduction about myself. After that, I was asked to code a telephone directory that had the functionality of adding, deleting, and searching for a number in that. I wrote a brute force code for the following, then he asked me to optimize this using trie. For that, I just explained the approach to him. He then asked me a probability question. This interview lasted for 30 min.\n\nThe third round was an HR round to assess my culture fit for the company which lasted for 20 min. It included some standard HR questions and situations. The interviewer was quite friendly and fun to talk to.\n\n3) How to prepare for them?\n\nA) You should prepare DSA thoroughly as it is required in both coding rounds and interviews. Give as many contests on Codeforces and codechef as possible as it will help in solving questions faster in coding rounds. Maintaining consistency is crucial. For interviews, prepare notes for your CV explaining each project and internship. Try to explain the logic to the interviewer while coding the solution.\n\n4) What difficulties did you face while preparing for this Company/Profile? How did you overcome them?\n\nA) DP was a difficult topic in the starting. Vivek Gupta\u2019s DP workshop on YouTube is a good playlist to learn this topic.\n\n5) Are there any specific requirements such as department, CGPA, or other criteria for this position? Additionally, do certain PORs or EAAs enhance one\u2019s chances of securing this internship?\n\nThere was no such cutoff of CGPA or department for this role. It was open to all the departments. I don\u2019t think PORs contributed that much to get this internship.\n\n6) According to you, who should ideally apply for this job?\n\nA) Anyone who is interested in development and wants to explore software profiles should apply for the Sprinklr intern.\n\n7) Kindly attach your CV/Resume. What are some of the major points you think would be valid to mention in your CV while targeting this profile?\n\nA) Be honest about what you write in your CV and you should be able to explain everything in it. Having a prior intern in your CV will give you an advantage.\n\n8) Lastly, what advice would you like to give to the students aiming to grab CDC internships this year?\n\nA) \u25cf Don\u2019t take too much pressure during the CDC process and be yourself.\n\n\u25cf Get your CV reviewed by seniors and friends. Give mock interviews to boost your confidence.\n\n\u25cf DON\u2019T GIVE UP cause you might not get shortlisted in many companies. Just trust in your effort and hard work cause many good companies will come at a later stage."

        "content": "--\n\nListen\n\nHello everyone, I am Abhirup Pal. I am a third-year undergraduate student in the Department of Industrial and Systems Engineering enrolled in its BTech course. I am a boarder of Rajendra Prasad Hall of Residence, I am from Kolkata. I will be joining Sprinklr as a Product Engineer Intern this summer.\n\n2. How did you get into Sprinklr? What was the selection procedure?\n\nThe selection process consisted of an online coding test followed by 3 rounds of interviews: two technical and one HR round.\n\nThe online test consisted of 3 problems of medium-hard difficulty which were to be solved in 90 minutes. The problems were based on binary search, prefix sums, and dynamic programming.\n\nThose who solved 3 problems completely or 2 completely and one partially were shortlisted for the interview rounds.\n\nThe second round of interviews was purely DSA-CP based. The interviewer started by asking a tree problem based on shortest paths. I had not seen that problem before, so I thought for 10\u201312 minutes and explained my thought process. In the end, I gave an incomplete solution that would pass some of the test cases, so he pointed it out. Finally, I gave the complete solution and he told me to code it in a Google doc. The coding portion was rather simple, I only had to write a bfs function and then call it twice in the main function. The interviewer was satisfied, so he moved on to another problem, to which I first gave a brute-force solution followed by a binary search solution. After this, the round was over.\n\nThe HR round lasted only for about 15 minutes. The interviewer was quite friendly, he asked me about my background, my strengths and weaknesses, and some typical situational tasks. He also asked me about the kind of work Sprinklr does and I answered what I had learned from the interviewers in the previous rounds (XD!).\n\n3. How to prepare for them?\n\nThe same way one would prepare for any other software role: DSA-CP. There are a bunch of resources available on the internet for DSA. For practicing DSA at a beginner level, Leetcode is great. Once you are comfortable with basic topics you should participate in Codeforces or Codechef contests or at least upsolve contest problems, this would help you solve new problems during a test or an interview.\n\nIn the last month of preparation, you have to learn CS fundamentals: OOPs are sufficient for BTech, Dual Degree students need to know OS, and DBMS as well. You should be well prepared with your CV as well. Look up common questions and answers based on any skills or projects that you mentioned in your CV. You should also look up common HR questions with answers before the day of the interview, AI tools like ChatGPT can be really helpful in these.\n\n4. When did you start preparing for this role and according to you what is the ideal time for aspirants, to begin their preparation?\n\nI have been into Competitive Programming since my second semester. I did learn DSA, but I gave contests on Codeforces, and I could barely solve A and B of div2. I did CP more seriously from the second year onwards, learned more DSA, and practiced on Leetcode and Codeforces. By the end of the summer after the second year, I could solve 3\u20134 problems in div2 and 5\u20136 problems in div3.\n\nHowever, my ratings were only around 1500 on both of my CF accounts. There is no such ideal time to start preparing, start as early as you can.\n\n5. What difficulties did you face while preparing for this Company/Profile? How did you overcome them?\n\nThe major difficulty I faced was that my rating on codeforces was pretty stagnant. While practicing I could solve 1700\u20131800 rated problems, but could not do so in contests. So, I started solving every contest I participated in, identified my weak topics, and started strengthening them by solving simpler problems on Leetcode and Codeforces. On code forces, a simple rule of thumb is, if your rating is \u2018x\u2019, you should practice problems in the rating range \u2018x\u2019 to \u2018x+300\u2019.\n\nAlso, having a good peer group whom you can discuss problems with always helps.\n\n6. Are there any specific requirements such as department, CGPA, or other criteria for this position? Additionally, do certain PORs or EAAs enhance one\u2019s chances of securing this internship?\n\nThere were no such criteria as CG, POR, or EAAs, however, Sprinklr only allowed BTech students to apply, and BS students were not allowed this year. Anyways, having a decent CG always helps for software-based roles as some companies put CG criteria (&gt;=8 or &gt;=7.5) to apply for them.\n\n7. According to you, who should ideally apply for this job?\n\nAnyone who is interested in software development and Competitive Programming should apply.\n\nAny other skills like ML or Web dev are always helpful.\n\n8. What are some of the major points you think would be valid to mention in your CV while targeting this profile?\n\nYou should know the skills and projects you would mention in your CV well. Apart from this, a CV is not that important, PORs and EAAs do not matter. However, it is always a good idea to get your CV reviewed by your seniors and batchies.\n\n9. Lastly, what advice would you like to give to the students aiming to grab CDC internships this year?\n\nMy only advice would be to keep improving yourself every day, learn and practice as much as possible, do not worry about the result. Do not let the CDC judge your level of preparation, there are a lot of other factors involved like luck, department, etc. which you cannot control. Keep going, enjoy the process, and stay motivated!"

        "content": "FORESIGHT(2024): Internship at Databricks | Bhuvan Rangoju |\n\n--\n\nListen\n\n1)Brief introduction and description of the offered role\n\nHello, I\u2019m Bhuvan Rangoju, a 4th-year Integrated MSc student from the Department of Mathematics. I\u2019ve been offered a software internship at Databricks. In this blog, I\u2019ll share my journey in preparing for this role, my mistakes, and a few personal tips.\n\n2) How did you get into Databricks? What was the selection procedure?\n\nGetting into Databricks is not different from how you\u2019d get into a typical software company. At first, we had an online assessment (90 minutes) consisting of 4 questions selected from a pool of 10\u201315 straightforward questions; order n3 and n4 solutions were also accepted. The company shortlisted only circuital (and MnC) students who completed all four questions with an early submission. Unfortunately, I got stuck on one of the questions, which took most of my time, so I didn\u2019t make it into the initial shortlist. But it was decent enough to get a shortlist on the extended list.\n\nThere were three interview (online) rounds(coding + coding + HR). The order of rounds varied among different candidates.\n\nMy first coding round consisted of a single question, which I found quite challenging. The problem was to print a path from the start node to the end node in a Fibonacci tree(I still don\u2019t know what it is). I had to ask numerous questions to clarify the problem and begin coding. The interviewer was very friendly and supportive, which helped me stay calm. I asked a bunch of questions and communicated with the interviewer all the time, and within 45 minutes or so, I was able to finish the code, with which the interviewer seemed satisfied. Fortunately, my coding style \u2014 modularized functions, appropriate variable names, and clarifying comments helped me barely pass this round.\n\nThe second round was fairly easy compared to the previous round. I was asked two easy questions. The first one is a straightforward recursion with memoized DP. The second one was related to the Sliding window. Initially, I gave an O(nlogn) solution, but the interviewer was expecting a linear time complexity, which I was able to get at the very end of the interview using a deque with the help of a few hints.\n\nThe third round consisted of the typical resume grilling followed by an HR interview conducted by the Director of the Engineering team. He delved into every detail of my resume, from past internships to projects to PORs. Therefore, it\u2019s crucial to thoroughly review your resume before any interview, as you wouldn\u2019t want to miss an opportunity that could have been secured with just 1\u20132 hours of preparation.\n\n3) How did you prepare for them?\n\nIn my second year, I decided to target Software/ML roles for my CDC internship drive. Assuming you now understand the importance of CP, I won\u2019t emphasize this fact and will dive right into my preparation. Like any other beginner with coding, I was confused and overwhelmed by the abundance of resources available on the internet. After consulting some of my seniors, I started practicing on Codeforces & CSES in my 3rd semester. After a few months of consistent efforts, I reached a specialist rating. Unsatisfied with the fact that I struggled to reach an Expert rating, I felt a bit demotivated and discontinued CP for a while. But I continued giving contests now and then and up-solving questions, hoping to increase my rating. The summer of 2022 (just after the 4th sem) is when I became more serious and disciplined and focused more on learning new and difficult concepts that would help me in the long run. I felt pretty confident that I could clear most OAs even though I was just a specialist. It was during the winter break(December 2022) that I got into the dark blue zone, and I finally felt that my efforts had paid off. And just like that, I left CP, and since then, I haven\u2019t given more than a handful of contests and have practiced solving questions.\n\nBeing a non-CS guy, I had to teach myself OOPs(object-oriented programming). An NPTEL course by Partha Pratim Das (PPD) and practicing a handful of questions were enough to clear most OOP rounds. During my Mitacs internship in the summer of 2023(just before the internship drive), I did Interviewbit and Leetcode, which seemed easy given the knowledge and level of preparation I had by doing CP. As I said in the beginning, I also aimed for ML roles in companies like (Adobe, Amex, etc.) for which I read online blogs on ML algos and a playlist by Patrick Loeber on YouTube, which taught writing ML algos from scratch, which I genuinely enjoyed. I also did a bit of Probability & Statistics and puzzles from the standard books like Heard on the Street, 50 Challenging Problems in Probability, and BrainStellar, just in case I get shortlisted for quant roles, which I honestly had no hopes, given my CG (8.9), and CF rating(1695).\n\n4) What difficulties did you face while preparing for this Company/Profile? How did you overcome them?\n\nOne of the most common hurdles a beginner faces is not getting their basics cleared and directly moving on to intermediate concepts. I recommend revising the PDS course and practicing implementation-based questions on Hackerrank and CF Div 2 (A, B) & Div 3 (A, B, C, D) questions to get a grip on writing code. Learn STL in C++, which saves a lot of time when solving complicated and multi-concept questions from a resource of your choice.\n\nI never learned anything in a structured way and used to solve questions randomly based on tags on CF. Just before my OAs started, I spent some time on the USACO guide, which has everything organized and questions topic-wise sorted by difficulty. You can check that out. I also recommend taking up the Algozenith course by Vivek Gupta; the quality of questions and video lectures are to the point (worth every penny), which I had gotten to know just before my CDC interviews, so I couldn\u2019t complete it.\n\nMost of you must not have had any experience with OOP, so you can refer to any online course in the NPTEL / YouTube playlist to learn the basics. An in-depth understanding is required in software roles in quant companies for which people recommend learning from online websites like learncpp.com.\n\nI haven\u2019t focused much on fundamental computer science topics like Operating Systems, Computer Networks, and Databases. However, these are essential for quant roles. I recommend discussing with your peers or seniors in computer science for guidance.\n\n5) Are there any specific requirements such as department, CGPA, or other criteria for this position? Additionally, do certain PORs or EAAs enhance one\u2019s chances of securing this internship?\n\nDatabricks shortlists only circuital(CS, EC, EE) and MnC students with a CG of 9+. PORs and EAAs hardly play any role in the shortlisting process (except consulting roles). It only adds a point to discuss in the HR round and shows that you have worked with people or in a team (Kshtij Tech team in my case) before, which reflects the cooperative nature of the candidate.\n\n6) According to you, who should ideally apply for this job?\n\nAnyone interested in coding, solving algorithmic problems, designing applications, or just curious about working in the tech industry should apply.\n\n7) What are some of the major points you think would be valid to mention in your CV while targeting this profile?\n\nYou can find my CV below. Some points to keep in mind specific to software/quant roles: 1) Maintain a decent CG (9+).\n\n2) Do CP as much as possible, and try your best to reach Candidate Master.\n\n3) Mention your rating on various coding platforms like CF, CC, Leetcode, and Kickstart, Hackercup ranks (if they are good enough)\n\n4) Prior internship(s) is/are not a must, but have at least a couple of projects.\n\n5) Be thorough with every word in your CV and get it reviewed by seniors before finalizing it.\n\n9) Lastly, what advice would you like to give the students aiming to grab CDC internships this year?\n\nTake your preparation seriously. A couple of months of dedicated and planned preparation can have a significant impact on your result. Have a couple of friends who are there for you to compare and discuss stuff and to relax yourself from the stress and pressure you\u2019d be carrying during the CDC phase. Be consistent and enjoy the journey. Don\u2019t lose hope if you don\u2019t get a Day 1 company; I didn\u2019t. Just remember hard work and honesty always pays off, if not now, soon enough.\n\nLastly, I would like to thank my parents and my nagging sister for bringing the best out of me; my friend Lakshman Kattunga for challenging me (and helping me out in a few contests :) and Roopak Priyadarshi who boasted me now and then, and simplifying Div2 Ds for people like me to understand.\n\nI wish my juniors luck and all the best!"

        "content": "--\n\nListen\n\n1) Brief introduction and description of offered role\n\nHi, everyone! I\u2019m Pranav Kulkarni, a fourth-year dual-degree CSE student at IIT Kharagpur. I am a boarder of Nehru Hall of Residence. I will intern at AlphaGrep Securities as a Software Developer in the Summer of 2024.\n\n2) How did you get into AlphaGrep? What was the selection procedure?\n\nThe selection procedure consists of a common coding round for quant and software developer roles and a series of interviews.\n\nThe coding round had 4 DSA questions to be solved in 90 minutes. They were from a varying range of difficulties. The most straightforward question was based on a standard LIS problem, then a question based on ranges and intervals, which was easily solvable using sets, and then a question based on tree travel involving probabilities consisting of printing precise decimal values; the most challenging question was an observation-based one which was also solvable using binary search on the answer. I solved all four questions within 50 minutes. Implementation skills matter a lot in these rounds. Even if you get the logic correct, you may make silly mistakes in your implementation, thus wasting vital time debugging your code. I was shortlisted for both Software and Quant profiles.\n\nMy interview consisted of three rounds, with questions involving CS core concepts like data types, data structures, static & dynamic polymorphism, inheritance, smart pointers, caching and paging, TCP & UDP, mutex and DSA concepts like DP, graphs, sliding window, tree, and arrays. Some of the questions involved facts that I wasn\u2019t aware of, but my logical approach while thinking of answers helped me get through them.\n\n3) How to prepare for them?\n\nTo get shortlisted, DSA is the most essential required skill to ace the coding rounds for software developer roles. Apart from regular contests on Codeforces, CodeChef & Atcoder, participate in competitions like ICPC, HackerCup, etc. Mentioning good ranks in these competitions significantly boosts one\u2019s CV.\n\nIf you are targeting HFTs, good practice of object-oriented programming is crucial, as some of the HFTs specifically test this skill during coding rounds.\n\nI primarily practiced the standard DSA topics like DP, Segment Trees, Trees and Graphs from CSES and AtCoder, and got an idea about how they are asked in the coding tests from the previous years\u2019 GOC CDC series.\n\nI\u2019d recommend preparing for OOPS and thoroughly knowing C++ STL containers and Operating System concepts to crack the interview. I followed the course slides to prepare for the OOPS and CS core concepts. To prepare for interview-specific DSA questions, I practiced using InterviewBit questions.\n\n4) When did you start preparing for this role and according to you what is the ideal time for aspirants to begin their preparation?\n\nI started my preparation for the software developer role at the start of my third year, as the topics covered during the courses were mostly related to core system design concepts. During the semesters, I couldn\u2019t devote any time to learning DSA due to my focus on maintaining my CGPA and learning all the Lab courses with a thorough understanding and practice.\n\nDuring the winter break of the third year, I started learning basic concepts like STL, which are essential for competitive programming. As I was very new to competitive programming, it took me the whole of December to learn the necessary basics.\n\nMy summer before CDC started with me as a pupil on the Codeforces and a 3-star coder on the CodeChef. With these not-so-good stats of competitive programming, I devoted the month of May to learning and practicing new DSA concepts. It was tough for me to learn and practice new DSA and OOPS concepts during the summer, so I recommend that others start learning these concepts during the breaks of the second year.\n\n5) What difficulties did you face while preparing for this Company/Profile? How did you overcome them?\n\nAs I said, the most significant difficulty I faced while preparing for the CDC was the need for more practice of DSA. To overcome this, I had to stick to standard practice questions from CSES and InterviewBit and rely on my problem-solving and implementation ability to solve questions in the coding rounds.\n\n6) Are there any specific requirements such as department, CGPA, or other criteria for this position? Additionally, do certain PORs or EAAs enhance one\u2019s chances of securing this internship?\n\nThe role was open only for circuital branches like CS, MA, EC, EE, and IE. The shortlist and priority to appear for the interview were based entirely on the test performance, so criteria like CGPA, POR, and EAAs didn\u2019t make any difference.\n\n7) According to you, who should ideally apply for this job?\n\nAny student who is highly interested in system design, has good implementation skills & a grip over DSA, enjoys fast-paced learning, and is highly efficient in programming should ideally apply for this job.\n\n8) Kindly attach your CV/Resume. What are some of the major points you think would be valid to mention in CV while targeting this profile?\n\nHaving a high rating on Codeforces is always a major plus. You can also mention the ranks you obtained in popular coding contests such as Google Kickstart and Facebook HackerCup. If you have taken part in ICPC, mention that too.\n\n9) Lastly, what advice would you like to give to the students aiming to grab CDC internships this year?\n\nApart from talent and preparation, the procedure for grabbing an internship through the CDC depends on many other factors, such as your confidence, luck, communication, etc. I recommend you form a group of friends who are targeting the same profile as the resources and information you learn from them will consistently benefit in this luck-dependent, random process. Always believe in yourself, and don\u2019t get disheartened or overconfident by your performance in the coding rounds.\n\nAll the best for upcoming CDC internships!!\n\n1) Brief introduction and description of offered role\n\nHi, everyone!

        "content": "--\n\nListen\n\n1) A brief introduction and description of the offered role.\n\nA) Hello Everyone, I hope you guys are doing well. I am Mohd Amaan, a soon-to-be fourth-year undergraduate student from the Department of Electrical Engineering. I hail from Roorkee, Uttarakhand, and am a boarder of Patel Hall of Residence. Through the CDC process, I was able to get an internship in the software development role at Amazon.\n\n2) How did you get into Amazon? What was the selection procedure?\n\nA) Amazon came to campus on Day 3. We had one initial screening round, which consisted of two questions. There was a question bank, and the questions were more on the easy side, though there was some inconsistency with the environment. One was on basic strings, and the second question was based on iterative DP, which was easy but gave me some errors in two cases that were platform-specific. Most of the people completed the test within the first 15 minutes themselves. After getting the shortlist, we had only 1 interview which was a long one (1 hour+ in my case), which consisted of three questions, which were again on the easy side. The topics were binary search, binary trees, and linked lists. The interviewer just asked me to write the pseudocode, though I wrote the full code for all three questions.\n\n3) How to prepare for them?\n\nA) If I were to specifically refer to my experience with giving interviews at Amazon and Piramal, Leetcode/Algozenith would suffice for both the interview and the OA. But looking at the overall CDC experience, Competitive Programming prepared me to think about solutions with better speed and improved my code writing speed, which in general helped me in OAs and the interview itself. Leetcode/Algozenith is the cake, and CP is the topping XD\n\n4) When did you start preparing for this role and according to you what is the ideal time for aspirants to begin their preparation?\n\nA) I started preparing as soon as I went home for the summer vacation. I\u2019ll say that there\u2019s no ideal time. Start as early as you can, and don\u2019t panic. If you are someone starting summer vacations, I suggest you practice in chunks and divide your time between theory and problem-solving. Mine was something like 20:80, with 80 being the problem-solving.\n\n5) What difficulties did you face while preparing for this Company/Profile? How did you overcome them?\n\nA) In between the preparations, I felt like I had reached a steady state, which was not the case, which made me a bit laggy in between. My friends\u2019 group proved to be the most effective solution, providing me with assistance at every stage. We had formed a group to discuss daily practice, any challenges someone was facing, contests, etc. We spent hours on call discussing the edge cases and where the code might fail, which gave me confidence in the OAs.\n\n6) Are there any specific requirements such as department, CGPA, or other criteria for this position? Additionally, do certain PORs or EAAs enhance one\u2019s chances of securing this internship?\n\nA) From a departmental perspective, the answer is no. CG greater than 8 would be preferred. Amazon has some LPs (Leadership Principles) on which they focus a lot. I didn\u2019t have a resume grilling round, but surely a resume carries importance.\n\n7) According to you, who should ideally apply for this job?\n\nA) Anyone looking to work on scaling large systems that have a direct impact on the tech sector should apply for the position.\n\n8) Kindly attach your CV/Resume. What are some of the major points you think would be valid to mention in your CV while targeting this profile?\n\nA) They generally do not give much importance to resumes, but again, they have some Leadership principles on which they focus a lot. You never know what portion of your resume might attract the interviewer. Prepare a good resume and go through it thoroughly.\n\n9) Lastly, what advice would you like to give to the students aiming to grab CDC internships this year?\n\nA) Just keep yourself calm. Carry on the grind and eventually, you will make it. You won\u2019t feel you have done enough at any point because there are endless things to learn. Just keep on grinding, do CP, practice more problems, build a good resume, and you will be there."

        "info": "Practice problems from Leetcode, Codeforces, GeeksforGeeks, etc or whatever platform you are comfortable with and can keep InterviewBit for the last 1\u20132 months as it consists of just the right set of questions one requires before the assessments.",
        "content": "Foresight(2024) : Internship at Microsoft | Ayushi |\n\n--\n\nListen\n\nHello everyone, I am Ayushi, a pre-final year undergrad at IIT Kharagpur enrolled in its B. Tech course of Instrumentation Engineering. I am a boarder of Mother Teresa Hall of Residence and I shall be joining Microsoft India as a Software Engineering Intern this summer.\n\n2) How did you get into Microsoft? What was the selection procedure?\n\nI got into Microsoft through the Career Development Centre, IIT Kharagpur. The process consisted of an online assessment (in mid-July) and two rounds of interviews (on Day 1) -\n\na. Online Assessment -\n\nThe online assessment was held on Codility and was about an hour long. It consisted of two coding questions of medium-hard difficulty. From what I remember, the first question was to find out the longest symmetric substring from a string of (<,>,?) and the second question required us to use Union-Find. One needed to solve both the coding questions correctly to get through.\n\nb. Technical Round -\n\nWell, this was quite an experience as we were allotted our panels at around 4:30 in the morning. So do keep your sleep schedule flexible to help in times like these. The interviews were held online at Nalanda. In my interview, I was asked the standard \u2018Trapping Rain Water\u2019 problem. Initially, I had to give the brute force approach and then optimize it to satisfy the time constraints provided by the interviewer. The key here was to consistently communicate with your interviewer and keep them informed of your thinking process. They can be quite friendly and can help you find the way out if you are stuck somewhere.\n\nc. Technical+HR round -\n\nSoon, after my first interview ended, I got a call for my next interview. The process was similar here. I was asked a question on trees and I was required to present my solution, starting with the brute force approach and ultimately arriving at the most optimized version. For the HR part, the interviewer asked me to briefly describe the project that I found most intriguing. The interview lasted for approximately 45 minutes.\n\n3) How to prepare for them?\n\nFor the coding round, I would suggest starting with DSA as early as possible. Practice problems from Leetcode, Codeforces, GeeksforGeeks, etc or whatever platform you are comfortable with and can keep InterviewBit for the last 1\u20132 months as it consists of just the right set of questions one requires before the assessments. Participate in CF contests regularly and make it a point to upsolve the questions otherwise it won\u2019t help. (Also you can participate in the contests held by Grimoire of Code as they consist of some quality questions)\n\nFor the interview round, one must be thorough with your CV as the interviewer might ask questions about any point they find interesting. You must remain calm and composed throughout the entire process. Even if you are stuck somewhere, there is no need to panic. Communicating with the interviewer can be very helpful in ultimately finding your way to the final answer.\n\n4) When did you start preparing for this role and according to you what is the ideal time for aspirants to begin their preparation?\n\nIf anyone is aiming for a technical role in CDC, having a thorough knowledge of DSA is essential. I started learning DSA in my second year. To be honest, balancing DSA with your acads is challenging, and there were times when I had to focus solely on academics. However, if you manage your time effectively and are able to learn even one concept in a week, even that is sufficient. Taking small steps is what truly matters.\n\n5) What difficulties did you face while preparing for this Company/Profile? How did you overcome them?\n\nThe major issue I faced during my preparation was finding a clear roadmap with all the necessary resources in one place. There are a plethora of resources available online but choosing from them efficiently is a big task. Talking to seniors who prepared for the same profile last year is the best thing one can do in such situations. Moreover, It was tough to stay motivated and follow the same routine consistently for three months but having a group of friends to discuss doubts and share daily progress made the preparation journey much easier.\n\n6) Are there any specific requirements such as department, CGPA, or other criteria for this position? Additionally, do certain PORs or EAAs enhance one\u2019s chances of securing this internship?\n\nFor an SDE role, positions of responsibility (PORs) don\u2019t really matter, though they do enhance your CV overall. However, for CDC internships, a higher CGPA can significantly improve your chances of being shortlisted, in addition to your programming skills. Some companies even have a CGPA cutoff in their online assessments, so having a higher CGPA is always advantageous.\n\n7) According to you, who should ideally apply for this job?\n\nAnyone who loves problem-solving, enjoys coding and is interested in development can apply for this internship role.\n\n8) Kindly attach your CV/Resume. What are some of the major points you think would be valid to mention in CV while targeting this profile?\n\nIncluding good projects or previous internships in your CV can always be the starting point of discussion with your interviewer. They might simply ask you to skim through one of your projects. Present your work well in your CV and make sure to bolden the key aspects. Be confident in whatever you mention as not being able to explain your own project details can create a really bad impression on the interviewer. For software roles, listing your contest ratings can also be a distinguishing factor.\n\n9) Lastly, what advice would you like to give to the students aiming to grab CDC internships this year?\n\nMy main piece of advice would be to make use of these three months wisely. It is all about time management and putting in your efforts consistently. Don\u2019t hesitate to contact your seniors who have gone through the same process last year. They might be the best ones to guide you both on the professional and the personal front. The intern season is both hectic and confusing and might lead you to question your own abilities at times. But remember that if you have put in your time and efforts dedicatedly in the process, it is definitely going to pay off in the end. So just focus on giving your best every time. All the best!!"

        "content": "FORESIGHT(2024)\u00a0: Internship at Graviton Research Capital LLP | Swapnil Yasasvi |\n\n--\n\nListen\n\n1) Brief introduction and description of offered role\n\nHi, I am Swapnil Yasasvi, a fourth-year undergraduate from the Department of Computer Science and Engineering. I will be joining Graviton Research Capital LLP this summer as a Software Engineer Intern.\n\n2) How did you get into Graviton Research Capital LLP? What was the selection procedure?\n\nAs a participant in the CDC Internship Program facilitated by the placement cell at IIT Kharagpur, I applied for the Software Engineer position offered by Graviton during the on-campus recruitment drive. Graviton provided two roles: Software Engineer and Quantitative Researcher, with a restriction to choose only one.\n\nThe selection process comprised a DSA-based test on Hackerearth, featuring two medium-hard questions. Candidates who completed both questions proceeded to the interview rounds.\n\nThe initial interview round included questions on probability and statistics, alongside a hard dynamic programming-based DSA question with some invariance observation.\n\nThe second round involved solving a puzzle and delving into computer fundamentals such as operating systems and computer architecture.\n\nDuring the HR round, I faced typical HR inquiries like why I was interested in joining Graviton, narrating my journey, and outlining my future aspirations. Since I hadn\u2019t specifically prepared for HR questions, I provided spontaneous responses. Towards the conclusion of the HR round, they extended the offer to me.\n\nUltimately, Graviton selected two candidates for the Software Engineer role and one for the Quantitative Researcher position. I was fortunate to be chosen for the Software Engineer position.\n\n3) How to prepare for them?\n\nIn the lead-up to the CDC internship process, I noticed that Dynamic Programming (DP), Graphs, Trees, and Segment Trees were repeatedly asked in the tests. I diligently worked through the entire CSES problem set for these topics, also went through the AtCoder DP contest, and sought out problems on Codeforces (CF) and AtCoder to solve.\n\nThe three months right before the CDC internship process kicks off are super important. If you use them right and plan meticulously you can get good results. In May, I dived into solving DP and graph problems on CF with ratings above 1700, along with Algozenith.Whenever I needed to get the hang of new concepts, I often referred to USACO and cp-algorithms. In June, I dedicated my time to practicing problems on AlgoZenith and LeetCode, with a keen focus on DP, Graphs, Trees, and Segment Trees. Additionally, I tackled problems covering important topics such as string algorithms, Trie, and two-pointers. For linked lists, I primarily practiced from Interviewbit. Furthermore, I started revising Operating Systems using class slides and engaged in solving easy-medium Brainstellar problems.\n\nIn July, I focused on revising CS core like OOPs, Computer Architecture, and Computer Networks through class slides. Additionally, I also started working on problems from the GOC CDC series.\n\n4) When did you start preparing for this role and according to you what is the ideal time for aspirants to begin their preparation?\n\nSo, my main goal was to land an SDE role, and Competitive Programming (CP) is crucial for acing the tests and securing interview opportunities. I\u2019ve been into CP since my second year, but if you\u2019re just starting and your CDC internships are coming up soon, focus on brushing up on your basics first. Spend a week or two on standard data structures/concepts like stacks, queues, priority queues, sets, multisets, and number theory topics like the sieve method, as well as DFS and BFS.\n\n5) What difficulties did you face while preparing for this Company/Profile? How did you overcome them?\n\nI didn\u2019t have many problems, but I was anxious about making mistakes because of the pressure. To stay calm and collected, I followed my friend\u2019s advice and took some deep breaths right before the interview. Also, it\u2019s crucial to talk to your interviewer. You shouldn\u2019t stay silent for too long without saying anything. I always made sure to share any ideas or small steps in a helpful direction with the interviewer.\n\n6) Are there any specific requirements such as department, CGPA, or other criteria for this position? Additionally, do certain PORs or EAAs enhance one\u2019s chances of securing this internship?\n\nYes, the department you belong to does matter, especially if you\u2019re from a circuital department, you might have a slight advantage. But even if you\u2019re not, you can still improve your Competitive Programming (CP) skills and Dev skills to increase your chances of getting an interview. Also, your CGPA is important. The higher it is, the better your chances, especially for companies like Quadeye and Glean, which shortlist based on CGPA alone.Positions of Responsibility (POR) don\u2019t matter much for Software Development Engineer (SDE) roles. 7) According to you, who should ideally apply for this job?\n\nIndividuals interested in a career combining software engineering and finance/quant should consider applying for a role at Graviton Research. The company offers a unique opportunity to work in both fields, using computer science to solve complex financial problems. If you have a passion for technology and a strong understanding of finance/quant, this could be an ideal position for you.\n\n8) What are some of the major points you think would be valid to mention in CV while targeting this profile?\n\nHFTs and many other Day1 companies often don\u2019t even glance at your resume before the interview. They might only check it when they\u2019re shortlisting candidates. During the interview itself, they\u2019ll ask questions related to the job and your skills, regardless of what\u2019s on your resume.\n\n9) Lastly, what advice would you like to give to the students aiming to grab CDC internships this year?\n\nThe CDC process, including preparations, tests, and interviews, can be mentally draining, leading to a loss of motivation. To overcome this, I recommend forming a study group to discuss problem-solving approaches and keep track of deadlines. It\u2019s also beneficial to maintain regular communication with peers to gauge your preparation progress. Taking assistance from seniors in reviewing your CV is essential, and don\u2019t hesitate to ask for their guidance.\n\nIt\u2019s crucial not to let demotivation affect you. Comparing your progress to that of others may discourage you, but it\u2019s important to stay positive, learn from your mistakes, and focus on improvement for future opportunities.\n\nWishing you all the best for your upcoming internship drive."

        "content": "FORESIGHT(2023): Summer Internship at Amazon | Aryan Gupta |\n\n--\n\nListen\n\n1) Brief Introduction\n\nHello everyone! I am Aryan Gupta, a third-year undergraduate in the Department of Chemical Engineering enrolled in its BTech course. I am glad to be able to help out fellow KGPians with what I have learned in the process .whilst securing an SDE intern at Amazon via the CDC procedure.\n\n2) How did you get into Amazon? What was the selection procedure?\n\nI would like to briefly outline my journey throughout the second year and how it has contributed. My interest in computer science topics led me to take various application-level courses in CSE and related departments. This gave me course projects with hands-on experience in core software projects. I had some exposure to web dev and data science via the general championship competitions. All these experiences helped me develop a solid background.\n\nAs far as the selection process goes, it included a coding round and an interview for me. The coding round had three questions ranging from medium to hard. The interviews involved a discussion about my projects, followed by coding questions to be approached in a step by manner by improving the solution gradually.\n\n3) How to prepare for them?\n\nI will not undermine the DSA preparation that remains omnipresent in the process. I had some early exposure to C++. Nevertheless, I prepared the usual set of topics, used GFG and YT as my helping hand, and gave contests to prepare myself for the time-constrained setup. Also, it is very important to practice from Leetcode and InterviewBit for the standard questions.\n\nThanks to our seniors who have compiled a detailed resource manual for preparation (Link)\n\n4) What difficulties did you face while preparing for this Company/Profile? How did you overcome this problem?\n\nThe main problem that needs to be cleared for people preparing for CDC is regarding a roadmap/guide to conquer X. Rather; one needs to understand the importance of sticking to a plan but be adaptive in the process according to the situation. You can chalk out your plan and take guidance from seniors or take a course if it helps, but you need to be consistent.\n\n5) According to you, who should ideally apply for this job?\n\nThis role is meant for problem solvers, and that is what gets tested in the entire process. It can be that one is a good problem solver but doesn\u2019t want to adopt the coding route, which is perfectly fine.\n\n6) Any specific advice you want to give to the junta sitting for internships this year?\n\nAs a last piece of advice, remember that you will always find a way to excel if you strive to. So never get disheartened if your efforts do not yield results in CDC; the process isn\u2019t robust enough to judge your true potential. But use it as a reminder for the countdown to start thinking about what direction you want to proceed in your life and out of college."

I got an internship offer at Honeywell for the SDE role in the CDC internship drive in 2022.\n\n2) How did you get into Honeywell? What was the selection procedure?\n\nThe selection procedure consisted of an online coding round followed by a technical and HR interview. This year, Honeywell had separate tests for SDE and Data profile. There were three coding questions for the SDE profile. The questions were of medium difficulty.\n\nThe first interview round started with a few basic questions like Are you familiar with AWS or Azure? Are you proficient in Java? After such questions, the interviewer asked me to explain the first project on my CV. Then they asked some questions like what was the motivation behind that project? What were the challenges you faced, and how you overcame them? The first round lasted for forty-eight minutes.\n\nThe second round was the HR round. It was a short round of about ten to fifteen minutes, and they asked the standard HR questions like what do you expect from this internship? What are your strengths/weaknesses? Etc.\n\n3) How to prepare for them?\n\n4) What difficulties did you face while preparing for this Company/Profile? How did you overcome this problem\n\nI faced some problems in DSA. To tackle this problem, solving medium to hard-level questions regularly is the key. Once you know how to apply the standard techniques, you will become more confident.\n\nPreparing the CV was also a challenging part. I spent many hours thinking about what questions could be asked on my different projects and preparing their answers. For the HR part, I referred to some online articles, which were enough to get an idea about the HR questions and prepare their answers.\n\n5) According to you, who should ideally apply for this job?\n\nSomeone who is interested in coding or development should apply for this role.\n\n6) Any specific advice you want to give to the junta sitting for internships this year"

I am a final year undergraduate student of the Department of Industrial and Systems Engineering enrolled in its Btech degree course. I am a boarder of RK Hall of Residence. I was born and brought up in Jalandhar. Talking about my previous experience, I had a remote research intern at the University of Birmingham which was about a particular algorithm which was developed by the professor.\n\n2) How did you get into Honeywell? What was the selection procedure?\n\nHoneywell is open to all departments. The selection procedure was similar to most of the companies Firstly, there was an online test. It had 3 questions and were okayish level questions as far as I remember. Before Honeywell, I had one interview in DE Shaw in which I was rejected after my first round. In DE Shaw, I was asked about a medium-level coding question and after that, the person was more interested in CS fundamentals I told him that I was not comfortable with them, but he still asked me them and I tried to answer my best.\n\nFor Honeywell, After the test, we had 2 interviews. The first one was technical and the second was HR. Personally, my interview was pretty chill and they literally asked me nothing in the interviews. My technical interview was for just 5 mins in which I got the question of how could you reverse a string. Probably the person taking the interview was not from a coding background. So, after that, I was asked about very basic concepts of OOPS and it was just that. But note that it wasn\u2019t the case for everyone. Many of my friends had interview for more than half an hour.\n\n3) How to prepare for them?\n\nIn my case, no preparation was needed! Xd, Jokes apart so, my preparation level was very good and I was expecting a day 1 intern but all happens for good! So, for preparation, I would say that it all depends on how much time are you having. I will tell you all the possible preparation which you could consider depending on the time you are having.\n\n2\u20133 Months: Focus on DSA. Try to do problems on websites like GFG, interview bit, leetcode\n\n3\u20136 Months: So, it depends on you if you are having this much time. So, if you are interested in quant, you probably need to devote some(very small) time towards it. You will also need to focus on Competitive programming as it might be helpful for the coding rounds of some companies.\n\n6\u201312 Months: You are having a lot of time. I will advise that you should really try to get involved in competitive programming and try to increase your ratings. It will eventually help you out at some point.\n\n4) What difficulties did you face while preparing for this Company/Profile? How did you overcome this problem\n\nThe problem which most people face is getting confused about what to prepare and where to prepare from as there are a lot of resources. I would suggest focusing on a single resource and getting a grip on the topic in general.\n\n5) According to you, who should ideally apply for this job?\n\nAnyone who is interested in a software development role should apply\n\n6) Any specific advice you want to give to the junta sitting for internships this year?\n\nMy only advice is just to try your best and try to learn more and more things and don\u2019t worry about the output that your hard work or preparation is going to have. Just be in the process, enjoy learning it and try to be your best self because you are never going to have that much time in your life again for this preparation."

        "content": "FORESIGHT(2023): Summer Internship at Cisco | Gaurav Madkaikar |\n\n--\n\nListen\n\nBrief Introduction\n\nHey everyone! I\u2019m Gaurav Madkaikar, a final-year dual degree student from the Computer Science and Engineering Department. I received an opportunity to intern at Cisco via the CDC Internship Drive held last year, in 2022.\n\nHow did you get into Cisco? What was the selection procedure?\n\nThe selection procedure included an online screening test followed by three interview rounds\u2013 two technical rounds and an HR round.\n\nOnline test:\n\nThe test consisted of roughly 40 MCQs based on various CS concepts like OOPs, operating systems, computer networks and two coding questions. There was no negative marking for the MCQs. Both coding questions were based on graphs, with the first being an implementation of Floyd Warshall and the second having a DP-based solution. I solved the first one entirely and the second one partially and was shortlisted for the interviews.\n\nRound 1: After a brief introduction, the interviewer gave me a standard sliding window question which I explained and coded quickly. He then asked me multiple questions on OOPs\u2013 virtual functions, copy constructors, and singletons, to name a few. Given that I had mentioned OS and CN in my course curriculum, he went on to ask a lot of questions about these topics. Since I had already covered these topics in detail in my sixth semester, I was in a good position to answer all of them. He ended with an implementation question based on binary trees. The interview extended to an hour, and I was quickly called in for the second round.\n\nRound 2: The interviewer was a senior manager who asked me to share any previous project experiences and any challenges I faced. We then had a detailed discussion about the projects mentioned in my CV. The interview ended with me asking some questions about his experience in the company.\n\nHR Round: This was a very short round of roughly 10\u201315 minutes. He was pretty chill and enquired about my interactions in the previous rounds, following up with some standard HR questions like, why do you want to join Cisco, where I see myself in 5 years\u2019 time. The round ended with a discussion about the stipend and my preference for the work location.\n\nHow to prepare for them?\n\nIn general, you need to be thorough with your DSA problem solving skills for any software related position. Keep reading about the various algorithms through articles on geeksforgeeks and cp-algorithms.com (specially for graphs). Practicing them regularly via leetcode/interviewbit would help. I, personally, covered certain bookmarked questions on leetcode and focussed on solving interviewbit completely. I also gave contests conducted by Grimoire of Code(GOC), which helped me get a feel of what the CDC tests would look like. Although I didn\u2019t focus much on CP, I did have friends who gave contests on CF regularly, but I would recommend it only after you have covered considerable ground.\n\nApart from DSA, having knowledge of CS topics like OOPs/OS/DBMS/CN (descending order of importance) is always a bonus, especially OOPs is a must. These topics can be looked upon from learncpp.com (OOPs), geeksforgeeks and the corresponding course slides from the CS department. Make sure to check out previous interview experiences, the type of questions asked and some basic general knowledge corresponding to the company you\u2019d be interviewed for.\n\nWhat difficulties did you face while preparing for this company/profile? How did you overcome this problem?\n\nFrom my personal experience, I would suggest everyone not be overwhelmed with the amount of resources available for preparation. Choose your resources at the start and stick with them until completion before moving on to something else. Put a heavy focus on improving DSA, as it is the most important factor in getting interview shortlists. Other topics (like OOPs, OS) can be easily revised in the weeks closer to the tests/interviews. Focus on solving questions rather than just reading theory/code. In my case, I noted down those concepts/problems which were non-trivial and revised them at the end. Specifically, for this company, I expected questions from networks and OS and thus revised it the day before. Keeping contact with friends and family will surely help in calming down the stress levels as the tests approach.\n\nAccording to you, who should ideally apply for this job?\n\nAnyone who is interested in problem-solving, enjoys programming and is keen on developing software whilst aspiring for the best work-life balance can apply to Cisco. Any specific advice you wantto give to the junta sitting for internships this year The CDC phase will be challenging, competitive yet fun in its own manner. Try to target one or two profiles and prepare accordingly instead of applying to all. The earlier you start your preparation, the better it is. Get insights from seniors/friends who have gone through the process and prepare a resume that truly reflects your skills. DSA is the most important factor in getting interview shortlists, so put your maximum time and effort into mastering it. Try to give mock interviews in parallel so that you get used to the formal setting.\n\nDuring interviews, be confident and let your interviewer know about your thought process. Start with brute force and then proceed towards the optimal one. If you are stuck at any point, ask the interviewer for clarification and explain your current approach. Interviews can get really tiring, so make sure you sleep well and are hydrated throughout. Handling rejections is as important as any skill in your resume, so don\u2019t be disheartened and hope to give your best for the next opportunity. Believe in yourself, and the good days aren\u2019t far ahead!\n\nWhat are some ofthe major points you think would be valid to mention in your CV while targeting this profile? (any specific suggestions you would like to make)\n\nHaving good projects or previous internships on your CV help in initiating discussions around programming with your interviewer. They also indicate your ability to learn and develop on the go. You can create your own projects and/or collaborate with your friends and build projects over a common course or an idea. Highlight the most important features of your project and write them down as full statements. Try to fill out your CV as much as possible with the relevant information. Showcasing your performance in competitive programming, competitions will certainly stand out. While mentioning a POR for the software profile is not that important, it can help in giving your CV an all-around perspective. Refrain from mentioning anything you are not confident about, prepare your CV thoroughly and be ready to be grilled on anything mentioned."

What was the selection procedure?\n\nThere were a total of three rounds, which I had to clear to get an internship at honeywell. The first round was a coding round which had moderate level three questions. The second round was a technical round where they asked programming and math questions along with my CV review.

I am from Ranchi, Jharkhand. I will be joining Honeywell as a software engineering intern from May\u201823.\n\nHow did you get into Honeywell(SWE)? What was the selection procedure?This role was open for all the pre-final students from all the departments. The screening test consisted of three coding questions with moderate difficulty levels. The test was conducted on the Hackerank platform.Question 1: It was on Graph Traversal, where we were presented with an undirected graph with N nodes and M edges and had to calculate the Connected Sum of each component and finally come to the final answer.Question 2: It was on Segment Tress, but O(n 2 ) approach passed all the test cases because of its weak nature. In this, we have given two arrays, one of which stores the indices of the items in the order they are placed in the queue, and the other stores the instantaneous position where the corresponding item is placed in the queue. It was mentioned that each time an item is inserted, all the following items are shifted toward the right by one position, and finally, we need need to find out the sequence of the item in the queue after all the items have been placed.Question 3: It was based on a map and some operations of it; I do not remember it exactly :)After the shortlisting based on CV and test, the next step involved a technical interview followed by an HR round. The technical round has some questions on sorting algorithms (as my project was a sorting visualizer), a couple of short coding questions followed by some basics on the OOPs concepts, and a brief discussion on all the projects I had mentioned in my CV and finally discussed all the technical expertise mentioned in my CV. The last round was the HR round, where standard HR questions like past experiences, what difference you can make if selected,and how you are a team player. HR would be particularly interested in extracurricular activities, your ability to express yourself, and, most significantly, whether or not you share the company\u2019s values. Going through the firm\u2019s page and checking out the current working domain of the organization is highly recommended for the HR round, as HR would want you to have some understanding of the company to which you are applying. Examine the company\u2019s values aswell.\n\nHow to prepare for them?\n\nTo prepare specifically for Honeywell, you should have an excellent grasp of Data Structures and Algorithms. There will be medium questions on the test, so clear all of the principles of conventional DSA, and concentrate more on Dynamic programming and graphs, as these topics are included in practically every company\u2019s test. In terms of coding examinations, you should solve questions for at least two months to gain a firm grasp. You could practice questions on sites such as Leetcode, InterviewBit, and GFG because the questions will be pretty similar. I personally used the AlgoZenith platform and InterviewBit mostly to solve the question.You should be familiar with the projects listed on your interview CV. Maintain your composure and avoid panicking throughout the interview. Never code in an interview as if you know everything about the problem; instead, try to interact with the interviewer, ask questions, and if you don\u2019t have any, tell him what you\u2019re doing to solve the problem and why you\u2019re doing it; only then will the interviewer be interested in you; ask for hints if you\u2019re stuck anywhere; the interviewer is there to help you; they just want to check your thought process. To prepare for the behavioral questions in the HR round, you should be familiar with the STAR (situation, task, action, and result) technique and look over the company\u2019s Leadership principles.\n\nWhat difficulties did you face while preparing for this Company/Profile? How did you overcome this problem?\n\nThe most challenging issue I encountered was thinking about the question with its optimal response in a certain period during the screening exam while under pressure to do better than others. To overcome this, you can give mock tests before the CDC test begins. Technical interviews are not the same as competitive programming. In interviews, you must gradually workyour way up to the most effective answer while being unaware of the limits. However, the limits determine the entire approach and mentality in a programming competition. Being a CP man might cause some issues during interviews. Occasionally not directly looking at the limitationsshould be sufficient to circumvent this difficulty.\n\nWhile studying for CDC, you may suffer rejections in coding exams, mainly due to CGPA on Day 1 or Day 2. During this time, you must be psychologically intense and trust in yourself.\n\nAccording to you, who should ideally apply for this job?\n\nAnyone interested in developing software, coding, or handling extensive data, in general, can apply for this role. Honeywell provides various tech stacks and projects for interns, including DevOps, Machine Learning, Web apps, MicroServices, Databases, and more. You might be able to work on these cutting-edge technologies. Anyone interested in these positions iswelcome to apply; Honeywell had no department or CG criteria at our time, and the work-life balance will become apparent after I begin my internship on the 22nd of May.\n\nWhat are some of the major points you think would be valid to mention in your CV while targeting this profile? (any specific suggestions you would like to make?)\n\nWrite down all of your projects/internships and show them adequately in your CV, as this is a crucial component of any interview. The project can be self-directed or directed by a professor. Highlight all of your accomplishments in the Academic Achievements section. Enter your handle ratings from sites such as Codeforces and CodeChef. Mention your rank if you participated in Google Code Jam, Kickstart, or Facebook Hacker Cup. Put open source contributions, if any.\n\nBest Wishes, and All the Best!!"

Once you have a firm grasp of the fundamentals, you can strengthen your problem-solving skills and develop a fast thinking to crack the coding questions in the online test. I recommend practicing questions from popular platforms like GeeksforGeeks, LeetCode, and CSES. You can even go for questions module-wise on Algozenith too.\n\nAfter gaining proficiency in standard DSA questions, you can test your skills by participating in coding competitions on platforms like CodeChef and Codeforces.\n\nAlso I would strongly recommend participating in various coding competitions, as this can have a positive impact on your CV. Additionally, it is crucial to practice dynamic programming, graphs, and trees extensively. For DP problems, I suggest tackling the hard and medium level challenges on LeetCode, while for graph problems, I found the CSES problem set to be quite helpful.\n\nAs you approach the last two months of your preparation, I strongly recommend using InterviewBit, as their problem set covers all the concepts you need to know and are likely to encounter in coding interviews( i did get one). During this time, you should also focus on solving puzzles and probability questions. For puzzles, I suggest checking out resources like \u201cHeard on the Street\u201d and GeeksforGeeks. For probability, you can try the book \u201c50 Challenging Problems in Probability.\u201d\n\nFinally, for CS core concepts like DBMS, OOPS, and networks, I suggest setting aside the last 2\u20133 weeks of your preparation to review and gain a rough understanding of these topics. You can refer to short notes on websites like AlgoZenith or GeeksforGeeks to help you quickly review and reinforce these concepts.\n\nAn important pointer: Don\u2019t get overwhelmed by all the different learning resources out there. Try to stick to one or two that really work for you, so you don\u2019t end up spending too much time wading through a ton of different stuff.\n\n4) What difficulties did you face while preparing for this Company/Profile? How did you overcome this problem\n\nOne of the biggest challenges I faced during my CDC preparation was the daunting amount of material to cover in a limited amount of time. To combat this, I found it helpful to team up with a small group of 2 or 3 peers. By setting targets and discussing problems together, we were able to make steady progress while also maintaining our mental well-being. I mean, let\u2019s face it, CDC prep can be pretty exhausting, so it\u2019s nice to have some support along the way. This approach allowed us to tackle difficult topics more efficiently and effectively.\n\n5) According to you, who should ideally apply for this job?\n\nAnyone who is interested in problem-solving and software development can apply for the software profile.\n\n6) Any specific advice you want to give to the junta sitting for internships this year.\n\n7)What are some of the major points you think would be valid to mention in your CV while targeting this profile?(any specific suggestions you would like to make?)"

        "content": "FORESIGHT(2023): Summer Internship at Goldman Sachs | Vishal Kumar |\n\n--\n\nListen\n\nHey everyone! My name is Vishal Kumar, and I am currently a 4th-year undergraduate student pursuing a dual degree in Mining Engineering. I am from Muzaffarpur,Bihar. This summer, I will be interning at Goldman Sachs.\n\n2. How did you secure an internship at Goldman Sachs? What was the selection procedure like?\n\nGoldman Sachs offers software and quant intern roles on our campus, open to students from all departments with no CGPA cutoff. The selection procedure consisted of two stages:\n\nFirst, there was an online test conducted on the Hackerrank platform a week before the interview. It comprised four sections:\n\nSection 1) Two Coding Questions:\n\nParticipants had to solve two coding questions in 30 minutes. The first question involved rearranging a string, ranging from easy to medium difficulty. The second question focused on matrices and graphs, presenting a medium to hard level challenge. Due to the time constraint, I was only able to completely solve the first question, while managing to pass some basic test cases for the second.\n\nSection 2) English Writing Skills:\n\nCandidates were required to write short answers to two questions within a total of 15 minutes. The questions were:\n\nWhat did you learn in your recent project?\n\nHow would you handle a situation where a team member is unable to complete their task, impacting your own performance?\n\nSection 3) CS Fundamentals:\n\nThis section included around 10 multiple-choice questions on topics like Object-Oriented Programming, Operating Systems, and Database Management Systems. Ample time was provided for this segment.\n\nSection 4) Quantitative Aptitude:\n\nThis section consisted of approximately 20 questions to be answered within 45 minutes. Although a few questions posed some challenges, a solid grasp of probability and basic logical ability was sufficient to navigate through this section.\n\nInterview Day:\n\nRound 1:\n\nThe round commenced with introductions, followed by the interviewer inquiring about a project from my CV. I provided a satisfactory response, after which I was presented with a puzzle involving 100 tigers and 1 sheep on an island. Although I had come across the puzzle before, I took my time, asked clarifying questions, and answered accordingly. Next, I was given a coding question through a Hackerrank ID and asked to share my screen. The question involved converting a fraction into a decimal, which was of medium difficulty on the LeetCode scale. I followed an almost correct approach throughout the code, even performing a dry run. This round lasted for 40 minutes.\n\nRound 2:\n\nThe final question involved finding the square root of a given number between 0 and 10\u2079. I explained the logic of using binary search and proceeded to write the code. I wrote the code for 1 to 10\u2079 and then used reverse logic for 0 to 1, which could be further optimized. Nevertheless, the interviewer appeared happy and satisfied. Towards the end, there were also questions regarding the company, my role, and growth opportunities. This round lasted for 45 minutes.\n\nFor most students selected from our campus, there was no HR round this time. However, it is advisable to familiarize yourself with basic HR questions.\n\n3. How should one prepare for the Goldman Sachs selection process?\n\nTo prepare for the online test, continue practicing Competitive Programming (CP) until the end. In the month leading up to the tests, shift your focus to platforms like LeetCode and InterviewBit to enhance your grasp of Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) questions.\n\nIf you lack confidence in your writing skills, practice writing concise answers to the questions mentioned earlier.\n\nFor the interviews, concentrate on strengthening your DSA knowledge and reviewing the fundamentals of Object-Oriented Programming. Additionally, explore resources like BrainStellar and YouTube for commonly asked probability and puzzle questions, as these are often covered in the initial round. During interviews, expect in-depth discussions on your CV, so ensure you have a thorough understanding of its contents. Utilize this opportunity to showcase your achievements and experiences.\n\n4. What difficulties did you face while preparing for this Company/Profile? How did you overcome them?\n\nStuck at similar rating levels:\n\nAt some point, individuals engaged in Competitive Programming may find themselves plateauing at a certain rating level. It is crucial to persist through this phase by solving a variety of problems and maintaining patience. Everyone faces this challenge, and only those who persevere ultimately succeed.\n\nOverwhelming amount of preparation:\n\nSome students pursuing B.Tech may feel they have less time compared to those in dual degree programs, resulting in a perception of having to cover a lot of ground. To overcome this, form a peer group and engage in discussions revolving around potential coding questions. This not only exposes you to different perspectives but also enables you to articulate your own thoughts effectively.\n\n5. Who should ideally apply for this job?\n\nIn my opinion, individuals with even a slight interest in finance or a desire to explore the field should definitely consider applying. Based on your performance in tests and interviews, you may be assigned roles related to finance or software development.\n\n6. Any specific advice for aspirants applying for internships this year?\n\nIn the previous year (2022\u201323), the entire process was conducted online. However, this year there is a possibility of the process returning to an offline format, similar to pre-COVID times. It is crucial to carefully read the instructions provided before starting any tests, as some sections may allow switching between them, providing an advantage. Practice numerous mock interviews, and articulate your thoughts and ideas confidently to the interviewer. Remember, if you began your preparation late and are unable to secure a good company through the CDC, it does not imply that you are less competent than those who performed well. Treat it as a valuable learning experience that will contribute to your personal growth. Additionally, prioritize the development of an impressive CV, as it can significantly distinguish you from other candidates.\n\n7. What are some major points you believe should be mentioned in your CV when targeting this profile? (Any specific suggestions?)\n\nAll the best for the upcoming internship season! Stay positive, stay motivated and be patient throughout the process."

        "content": "FORESIGHT(2023): Summer Internship at Sprinklr| Agnibha Sinha |\n\n--\n\nListen\n\nBrief Introduction\n\nHello everyone! My name is Agnibha Sinha. I am a third year B.Tech student of the Department of Electronics & Electrical Communication Engineering. I will be interning this summer as a product engineer at Sprinklr.\n\nHow did you get into Sprinklr? What was the selection procedure?\n\nThere was an online test followed by 3 rounds of interview.\n\nOnline Test: The test was held on HackerEarth and had 3 coding questions which were to be solved in 90 minutes. The questions were based on sliding windows, finding cycles in graphs and a variation of DFS to partition a tree. Overall it was a good mix of easy, medium and difficult problems.\n\nInterview Round 1: This round lasted around an hour. It started with an introduction followed by a couple of tricky questions on predicting the output. Then we moved on to standard interview questions involving binary trees and prefix sums. We were required to code on google docs and explain the solution including corner cases and optimize the space & time complexities.\n\nInterview Round 2: The second round lasted for another hour and followed similar logistics to the first round. The questions this time were more ad hoc and observation based. A few questions were also asked on the projects on my CV.\n\nInterview Round 3: The third round was a Culture & Talent round which lasted around 40 minutes and it included standard HR questions and brief discussion on my PORs and extracurriculars. The interviewer is really friendly and it is a fun round to talk in.\n\nHow to prepare for them?\n\nThe primary skill needed for such roles is DSA as it covers both the online test and major part of the interviews. Make sure you understand all the important algorithms in depth. For practice, there are multiple free resources available. Leetcode & Interviewbit are good for getting a grasp of the standard questions. Participating in contests on Codeforces and Codechef regularly helps in improving your speed and ability to solve new problems on the spot. You may also go for paid courses like Algozenith.\n\nIn the last few days, go through a few CS fundamentals like OOPs, DBMS (You may require more knowledge on CS fundamentals if you are a dual degree student). Brush up prob stats and look at a few puzzles from Brainstellar.\n\nFor the interviews, be prepared with your CV. Look up a bit about how the company functions and its objectives. Also prepare a few standard HR questions.\n\nDuring the interview, speak confidently and do not hesitate to ask the interviewer for hints. Think out loud and explain the solution as you are coding it. A few mock interviews will surely help you with this.\n\nWhat difficulties did you face while preparing for this Company/Profile? How did you overcome this problem\n\nThe major difficulty is that there are a lot of things to cover in very less time. For overcoming this, set achievable and realistic targets and prioritize important things. Another difficulty is forgetting specific topics which is where notes come in handy. Make notes yourself on topics you are not confident about and refer to them frequently. Losing focus and motivation are other issues faced which is where having a good peer group helps.\n\nAccording to you, who should ideally apply for this job?\n\nAnyone interested in the software profile can apply for this job. In case you are not specifically inclined towards any role and do not repel coding, I would suggest you to prepare DSA which is the requirement for majority of the opportunities in CDC including this role.\n\nAny specific advice you want to give to the junta sitting for internships this year\n\nThe entire CDC process requires you to be motivated at all times. You will find there are a lot of factors like CG, department and sometimes just luck which may go against you. Try not to worry about these things as you have no control over them. Just focus on what you have at hand and give your best. Keep in touch with your friends and family. Feel free to reach out to seniors for any advice. Do not take stress and accept things as they turn out. Above all enjoy the process!\n\nWhat are some of the major points you think would be valid to mention in your CV while targeting this profile? (any specific suggestions you would like to make?)\n\nBe honest about what you write in your CV and be ready to explain everything in it. Highlight your projects and internships if you have any. A good project makes your resume stand out and can lead your interview. If you do not have projects currently, try some self projects but only after you are confident with DSA. You can mention your ratings on competitive programming websites and ranks in different contests. PORs do not have much value in the software role but do mention them if you have them as it may be one of the talking points in the HR round. Get your CV reviewed by a few seniors and follow proper formatting. Have a draft of the content you would put on your CV before the ERP portal opens up. Making a CV on ERP directly is not the smoothest process."

        "content": "FORESIGHT(2023): Summer Internship at Sprinklr | Adarsh |\n\n--\n\nListen\n\n1) Brief Introduction\n\nI am Adarsh, a 4th year undergraduate from the department of E&ECE. I am from Jamshedpur, Jharkhand. I like to play computer games, watch web series and talk with my friends.\n\n2) How did you get into Sprinklr? What was the selection procedure?\n\nThe selection procedure consisted of multiple rounds. The initial round was a coding round, which included three questions. The first question was based on arrays and prefix sums, while the other two were related to trees, involving mathematical concepts and dp on trees. The first question was relatively easy, while the second and third questions were of medium difficulty. I was able to complete all the problems within 45 minutes, which made me hopeful of being shortlisted.\n\nThe initial shortlist included students who were able to solve all the problems. However, later on, the shortlist was extended to include the students who completed two problems completely and one problem partially. This expanded shortlist advanced to the next stage, which comprised three rounds: two technical interviews and one HR round.\n\nIn the first technical round, the interviewer began by asking whether JavaScript is pass-by-value or pass-by-reference. I honestly admitted that I could guess but did not know for sure. The interviewer acknowledged my response and then presented me with a dynamic programming problem. Although I initially struggled to grasp the problem, I provided a brute-force approach. When the interviewer requested an optimized solution (which I hadn\u2019t considered at that moment), I asked for clarification to better understand the question. Once I comprehended the problem, I presented the optimal solution. The interviewer then asked me to open a text editor of my choice and write the code. During this process, he cross-questioned me, exploring alternative scenarios by suggesting modifications to the code. I confidently answered all the queries, and the interviewer praised my performance. However, he inquired about my knowledge of data structures. When he asked if I was familiar with segment trees, I responded affirmatively. He then posed some simple range query problems, which I successfully solved. Additionally, he specifically asked me about lazy propagation, to which I explained the logic. He further asked if I could code it without using a template, and I assured him that I could, although it might take some time. He accepted my answer, and we proceeded with the discussion, during which he shared information about the technology stack used at Sprinklr, emphasizing their focus on new technologies rather than legacy code.\n\nIn the second technical round, the interviewer began by emphasizing that the internship would be my first major project. He then proceeded to ask a problem related to topological sorting in graphs. I quickly understood the logic before he finished presenting the question and immediately recognized it as a topological sort problem. I explained the method to him, and he instructed me to write the code in my text editor. While coding, he provided guidance and pointed out any mistakes I made, allowing me to correct them. After completing the question, he presented problems related to expectation value, which surprised me since the role was for a software development engineer (SDE). Nevertheless, the problems were relatively easy, and I promptly solved them.\n\n3) How to prepare for them?\n\nAs a dual degree student, I observed the internship phase of the B.Tech students. To gather insights, I approached a friend (Shobhit Gupta) who had received an internship offer from Sprinklr and asked about his preparation strategy. He simply said \u2014 \u201cCP karlo ho jayega\u201d. Taking his suggestion, I began practicing CP problems from the beginning of my third year, primarily on Codeforces. Additionally, I watched videos from AlgoZenith, a resource for learning algorithms.\n\nInitially, I faced difficulties in solving C-level problems. To address this, I decided to complete the A2OJ Div2 C ladder, which proved to be an effective way to enhance my problem-solving skills. I finished the ladder in November. Soon after, I started participating in Codeforces contests, and by December, I achieved the Expert rating (although I was fortunate since there were two Div3 rounds during that time since to become expert in second ID it took me much more time). After completing the Div2 C ladder, I moved on to the Div2 D ladder. This ladder introduced me to various new types of problems related to algorithms and data structures that I was unfamiliar with at the time. To learn these new concepts, I relied on resources such as the cpalgorithms website and blogs on Codeforces and practiced those on cses before proceeding to codeforces. I also studied the code of highly-rated coders to understand how to implement techniques efficiently.\n\nIn January, IIT Kharagpur announced an offline semester. Initially, I did not focus much on CP due to the offline activities. However, when the COVID-19 cases surged, I returned home and resumed my practice. During the offline part of semester, I gave my time to participating in contests(I had 2IDs and I used to give contests from the ID that was lower in rating this maintained the stability) , but I couldn\u2019t practice as intensively on campus. Once the exams were over, I returned home and began practicing more rigorously. I set a filter for problems in the range of 1800 to 2200 and worked on solving problems within that range. I continued using the strategy of two Codeforces accounts mentioned earlier, participating in contests from the account with the lower rating to maintain a stable overall rating.\n\nAround one month before the internship tests, I was able to solve four problems in Div2 contests. Additionally, I started practicing on InterviewBit, although I couldn\u2019t complete the platform (I had covered about half of the problems by the time the tests began). On Codeforces, my ratings were 1887 and 1869 on my first and second accounts, respectively, at the time of the tests. Overall, practicing on Codeforces significantly helped me since the platform exposes you to a wide range of problems, including those that may appear unexpectedly in tests or interviews.\n\n4) What difficulties did you face while preparing for this Company/Profile? How did you overcome this problem?\n\nI did not encounter any specific difficulties. However, I believe that if the third year had been conducted offline, it would have presented numerous challenges due to time constraints and other commitments in college.\n\n5) According to you, who should ideally apply for this job?\n\nI guess anyone who has an interest in software development and likes problem-solving.\n\n6) Any specific advice you want to give to the junta sitting for internships this year?\n\nSame advice as my friend gave to me \u2014 \u201cCP karlo ho jayega\u201d.\n\n7) What are some of the major points you think would be valid to mention in your CV while targeting this profile?(any specific suggestions you would like to make?)\n\nProjects are not very important. In my personal experience, the interviewer did not inquire about my projects. However, if you choose to include good projects in your CV, be prepared to be grilled on them."

I am a boarder of Azad Hall of Residence and I am from Jaipur, Rajasthan. I have my upcoming summer internship at Sprinklr as a product development intern.\n\n2) How did you get into Sprinklr? What was the selection procedure?\n\nThe selection process for Sprinklr involves a coding test with three questions, two of medium difficulty and one hard, followed by three rounds of interviews, including two technical and one HR. The coding questions covered topics such as Dynamic Programming, trees, and graphs, and those who successfully solved all three questions were invited to the interview stage.\n\nThe first technical interview focused solely on Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA), where I was presented with questions on bit manipulation, 0\u20131 BFS, Binary search, and Dynamic Programming. After explaining my solutions, I was asked to code them on a Google doc to ensure my understanding of the concepts.\n\nThe second round of technical interview centered around my CV, as I had previous experience in ML and Data Science, with Mitacs and other relevant internships and projects. I was asked to code an image classifier in a language of my choice, without using any external help. I mostly wrote a pseudo-code, and the interviewer focused on the order of operations and the correctness of function names and arguments. Additionally, they asked me various questions about why I was using certain techniques, such as AdaGrad, what other gradient descent algorithms were available, why I was using softmax activation in the last layer, and why activation functions were necessary. They also asked me a few questions about matrix algebra and probability. Many people who had a software CV were asked DSA in round 2 also.\n\nAfter this interview, we had a discussion about the projects and work-life at Sprinklr, which left me feeling confident about proceeding to the next round.\n\nThe third round of interviews aimed to assess my cultural fit with the company, and I had prepared by researching Sprinklr\u2019s core values, mission, and beliefs during the 10\u201315 minute break between the previous round and this one. During this interview, I was asked about my strengths and weaknesses and presented with situational tasks to evaluate how I would handle real corporate situations. They also asked me about my experiences with NSS work and Mitacs.\n\nI answered each question carefully, taking time to consider my responses, as I had been advised by seniors that Sprinklr was known for its selective HR process. After this final round, I felt confident about my chances of being offered a position, and shortly thereafter, I received a call from the CDC representative confirming my selection.\n\n3) How to prepare for them?\n\nIf you are interested in coding, I highly recommend dedicating significant time to practicing on Codeforces and LeetCode. Solving coding challenges within the given time frame is crucial for improving your speed and accuracy. Many of the questions on the coding tests I encountered were similar to those found on LeetCode. I personally solved around 400 questions from the well-known LeetCode sheet and also used InterviewBit in the final months of my preparation to reinforce my understanding of key concepts. To get the most out of Codeforces, I recommend\n\ntaking past contests as virtual contests. After a contest, it\u2019s important to dedicate time to \u201cupsolving\u201d, and I suggest trying to solve at least CF D-level problems. For topics that need more strengthening, I suggest using tags to find related questions. And lastly, I strongly recommend taking dynamic programming seriously, as it\u2019s an essential skill for any coding test.I will recommend Aditya Verma DP playlist on Youtube as well as Algozenith DP theory.\n\nFor those seeking to specialize in Machine Learning, I highly recommend reading the book \u201cHands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow\u201d. This resource provides an excellent overview of almost all ML and DL concepts, and I do not recall encountering a question on an interview that was not covered in the book. I do, however, advise that readers should have a foundational understanding of ML and DL concepts before reading this book. For example, taking Andrew Ng\u2019s ML course and the Deep Learning Specialization on Coursera (consisting of 5 courses) is highly recommended. I believe these resources cover most of the ML and DL questions one is likely to encounter in interviews.\n\n4) What difficulties did you face while preparing for this Company/Profile? How did you overcome this problem?\n\nOne of the biggest challenges I faced while preparing for a software role was maintaining a consistent coding practice during the summers. However, I was fortunate to have a supportive friend who helped me stay motivated by solving coding problems together. This mutual support system helped us both to improve our coding skills and perform well in coding contests. We would often discuss our approaches to coding problems for hours, which helped me to articulate my ideas more effectively during interviews.\n\nAdditionally, I was doing a MITACS internship at the same time, which left me with limited time to code compared to my peers. To overcome this, I recommend starting preparation early, ideally in December, to gain a competitive edge by the start of summer. In my preparation, I also studied fundamental concepts such as OOPs, SQL, and OS. These concepts helped me to have a better understanding of software development principles and apply them effectively during interviews.\n\n5) According to you, who should ideally apply for this job?\n\nIf you are confident with Competitive Programming and have a good understanding of Data Structures and Algorithms you must apply for this role. I think that is all Sprinklr wants and whatever additional skills you have like Web Dev or ML is just a bonus.\n\n6) Any specific advice you want to give to the junta sitting for internships this year.\n\nI suggest that applicants should not focus on a specific company but instead apply to several companies with similar backgrounds. Don\u2019t get discouraged if you don\u2019t receive an interview invitation from your dream company. Keep applying to other companies as you may end up in an even better one."

        "content": "FORESIGHT(2023): Summer Internship at Oracle | Gautam Singla |\n\n--\n\nListen\n\n1) Brief Introduction\n\nHello! I am Gautam Singla, a fourth-year undergraduate studying Mathematics and Computing at IIT Kharagpur. I will intern at Oracle in the Summer of 2023 as a Server Technology Intern. This blog is about my preparation and experience of coding rounds and interviews in the CDC Internship Process 2022\u201323.I was shortlisted for two companies on day 2 for interviews. These were Intuit and Oracle.\n\n2) How did you get into Oracle? What was the selection procedure?\n\nOracle conducts one online test consisting of many MCQs from every topic: Data structures, Mathematics, Reasoning, and English. It was a 2-hour long test. Questions were not too hard if you know about these topics (B-Tree, AVL Tree).\n\nSome students are shortlisted based on the above test, and CGPA plays a role in shortlisting for the interviews. After being shortlisted for interviews, they generally conduct three rounds, consisting of two technical rounds and one hr round. But I was one of the last students they interviewed, so there were three technical rounds for me. In the last round, the interviewer in the starting itself told me that they were expecting answers to all the questions.\n\n3) How to prepare for them?\n\nThe primary skill needed for someone sitting for an SDE role is Competitive Programming. I have done the Algozenith course AZ-201, which helped cover all the topics in detail.\n\nI have given leet code contests regularly. You must also upsolve problems that you were not able to solve during contests. Upsolving is important to improve your problem-solving skills. Don\u2019t just read the editorial; try to implement the solution yourself.\n\nSolving a lot of problems will improve your implementation skills which are important because if you write buggy codes during the coding rounds, you will not have enough time to debug your code even if your logic is correct. Also, if you have solved many problems, most coding round questions will seem familiar, and you will not have to spend much time thinking about the solution.\n\nAlso, keep giving contests organized by Google and Facebook, such as Kickstart and HackerCup. You can use the ranks obtained in these contests in your CV. I have also mentioned my Google Kickstart rank.\n\nI studied Object Oriented Programming from the course slides and GeekforGeeks. I have not studied Operating Systems or DBMS, and that will not be an issue, as you can tell the interviewer if you don\u2019t know these topics. If you have mentioned anything related to any other subject in your CV, you must know it.\n\n4) What difficulties did you face while preparing for this Company/Profile? How did you overcome this problem?\n\nInterviewer Rounds\n\nRound 1\n\nIt was an easy round which lasted for about 40 minutes. You will be asked to introduce yourself at the start of the round. You should prepare one short introduction which summarizes your profile. After the introduction, I was asked to explain one of my projects. You should prepare for the projects mentioned in your CV. If you are not able to explain things on your resume, it has a bad impact on you. One coding question was asked based on stacks, which was an easy question.\n\nRound 2\n\nIn this round, I was asked to introduce myself. In this round, my interviewer chose one of my projects written in my resume. So, you have to prepare for all the projects mentioned in your resume, as the interviewer can choose any random project from your resume. After that, I was asked a question from the Operating System, to which I replied that I had not studied this topic as of now. So, then they asked some questions on OOPS.\n\nRound 3\n\nGenerally, this was a hr round, but it was also a technical round for me. At the start of the interview, I was asked if they were expecting I will answer all the questions. They have asked me if I regret anything about two rounds before this round. After that, I was asked a simple question based on DFS in graphs. I was asked two puzzles at the end of the round. I was able to answer all the questions.\n\n5) According to you, who should ideally apply for this job?\n\nAnyone who has an experience in software profile and wants to have an experience in this domain should apply for this company.\n\n6) Any specific advice you want to give to the junta sitting for internships this year.\n\nCP is very important. Start as early as possible, and I recommend doing Competitive Programming over internships/projects in your free time.\n\n7) What are some of the major points you think would be valid to mention in your CV while targeting this profile?(any specific suggestions you would like to make?)\n\nYou should have three important things to write in your resume (2 projects, one internship, or three projects). Please be honest about whatever you write in your resume. The prior internship experience is good but not compulsory for grabbing an offer in CDC. I didn\u2019t have any internship experience before this."

        "content": "FORESIGHT(2023): Summer Internship at Oracle| Riddhiman Moulick|\n\n--\n\nListen\n\n1. Brief Introduction\n\nHi, I\u2019m Riddhiman Moulick, a final-year undergraduate in the Department of Electrical Engineering enrolled in its BTech Course.\n\n2. How did you get into Oracle? What was the selection procedure?\n\nSo, Oracle had a common test for its Applications Developer and Server Technology roles. The written test consisted of multiple timed sections. These sections consisted of MCQ/paragraph questions on General Aptitude, English, some fundamental CS concepts, and DSA (with a focus on AVL trees, different tree traversals, etc.)\n\nThe interview shortlists consisted of around 12\u201314 candidates for each role. I had 3 rounds of interviews.\n\nThe first round started off with a few questions on probability and PnC. Each answer had a short discussion on the approach as well. Then I was given a coding question on the HackerEarth platform based on the sliding window technique. I initially coded out the brute force solution and then moved on to the optimal solution but before I could complete it the time was almost over. So, I explained the approach I had thought of, to the interviewer with which he seemed to be happy. This round took around 50 minutes.\n\nThe next round first involved a detailed discussion of the projects in my CV followed by 1 coding question and an interesting puzzle over which we had a fairly long discussion. I was also asked whether I knew DBMS to which I replied that I was only familiar with the basics. The interviewer\n\nwas fine with this and instead asked me some questions on OOPs and Data Structures. This round went on for about 45 minutes.\n\nThe last round was mostly an HR round with standard behavioral questions and only 1 coding question on recursion and some basic mathematics. This round took about 30 minutes. The interviewers were very friendly which helped in having a sense of comfort during the interview.\n\n3. How to prepare for them?\n\nI personally started off a little late because of which I had to rush my preparation, so to get a good topic-wise understanding, I solved questions from InterviewBit and later on moved on to practice from Leetcode. But if you have sufficient time on your hands then definitely get as much practice as possible from CP/ regular contests as they will help you to improve your speed much more and reduce the need to think more on questions on the spot.\n\n4. What difficulties did you face while preparing for this Company/Profile? How did you overcome this problem?\n\nThe major difficulty I faced was due to my late start due to which I had less time in my hand (which was also majorly due to my dilemma as to which profiles I should focus more on). During my preparation, whenever I got stuck on a topic I used to solve more questions on the same topic for which I found the bucket-wise questions in InterviewBit to be very helpful. And specifically for this profile, it is helpful to have a working knowledge of other basic CS concepts as well, for both written and interview rounds for which I had to devote time towards the end.\n\n5. According to you, who should ideally apply for this job?\n\nAnyone who is interested in getting to know and working with new technologies, likes DSA, and wants to explore Software Development can apply for this role.\n\n6. Any specific advice you want to give to the junta sitting for internships this year?\n\nThe entire CDC phase is a long and mentally exhausting process. There are a lot of things that can go south even after a great preparation. Try not to get stressed out in such times and discuss whatever you feel, with whomever you are comfortable with, be it your friends or family. Keep in mind that a lot of things are beyond our control so just stay calm and give it your best!\n\n7. What are some of the major points you think would be valid to mention in your CV while targeting this profile? (any specific suggestions you would like to make?\n\nHaving previous projects or internships gives you control over the topic during the CV discussion with the interviewer so be sure to highlight such points in your CV. Be thorough with all the points in your CV and give it a look before the interview as you can be asked to describe specific parts of your projects too."

        "content": "FORESIGHT(2023): Summer Internship at Adobe | Raghav Aggarwal |\n\n--\n\nListen\n\n1) Brief Introduction.\n\nHi everyone! My name is Raghav Aggarwal. I am a final year undergrad from Electronics and Electrical Communications at IITKgp.\n\n2) How did you get into Adobe? What was the selection procedure?\n\nI applied to Adobe via the CDC internship program organized by CDC, IITKgp.\n\nThe first round was the coding test which contained pretty cliche questions in DSA with some alterations. I wouldn\u2019t say the test was easy but it wasn\u2019t on the too challenging side as well. The coding round was common to both Research and Product Development roles.\n\nThe first interview round was a pretty basic DSA round where they asked standard questions and then one hard difficulty question(grading the questions according to leetcode standards) before proceeding to the final interview stage.\n\nThe final interview was taken by a senior developer in the firm whose primary source of questions was my CV. He first went through all the projects and experiences and then selected a project to discuss in depth.\n\n3) How to prepare for them?\n\nFor the Coding round do interviewbit, leetcode and try timely practicing questions of DSA. One thing students get often confused between is Competitive Programming and DSA. They\u2019re not the same and hence if you\u2019re practicing on just Codeforces or Codechef start doing DSA practice as well. CP is good for timed practice and increasing analytical thinking but most of the companies in SDE are going to ask questions based on fundamental applications of DSA.\n\nFor the interview prep I\u2019d suggest making notes of your CV where you have pointers to explain each and every project/experience in both brief and detail. This will help you in a lot of interviews. Most of the interviewers I faced just asked me to skim through my projects and then asked detailed questions from a particular area in some project.\n\nAlso do remember to learn basics of computer memory organization (stack memory, etc.). It\u2019s not generally asked by any other firms but Adobe interviewers always ask questions from this area. You do not need to prepare thoroughly, a short 1\u20132 hour research on YouTube before the interview will suffice.\n\n4) According to you, who should ideally apply for this job?\n\nAs for the product development intern role, anyone who\u2019s interested in development and DevOps should definitely apply to this firm. The people around here are experts in their fields with a significant amount of experience. The guidance and learnings you will be provided here are unparalleled. Also the projects are based on Adobe\u2019s flagship products, hence you get to work on pretty fascinating and cutting edge tech. The code you\u2019ll be working on is going to be the production level code of the products and you get to learn a lot from the coding style itself used here.\n\n5) Any specific advice you want to give to the junta sitting for internships this year?\n\nDo talk to a senior in the same company before sitting for the interview. It always helps to know what the company might be expecting in the interview and provides you with an edge.\n\nDo not lie to the interviewer or give \u201cfundaes\u201d. These people are usually experts in their domain and know when someone is trying to fool them.\n\nDo let them know of your thought process while giving an answer in the DSA rounds, they might help you in the direction of the solution or warn you when you wander too far. They are more interested in your thought process than the final answer.\n\nAnd DON\u2019T GIVE UP! This might be the most important. You might be not shortlisted a lot of times or get rejected from an interview which went perfectly but sometimes things don\u2019t work in the way they should and misfortunes happen. Believe me there are plenty of better companies which come in the later days and it\u2019s going through the process itself which will make you learn a lot.\n\n6) What are some of the major points you think would be valid to mention in your CV while targeting this profile? (any specific suggestions you would like to make?)\n\nThe interviewer in my panel got fascinated by a simple C++ project (not DSA) because he had experience with similar kind of technology. One-third of my second interview went in just discussing that project which really made a good impression on my interviewer. Although the majority of us have works in Python, Machine Learning, etc. do remember to have a little diversity in the projects/experience section."

        "content": "FORESIGHT(2023): Summer Internship at Salesforce| Srijanak De|\n\n--\n\nListen\n\nBrief Introduction\n\nHey there, I\u2019m Srijanak De! I\u2019m a Computer Science and Engineering student enrolled in its dual degree course. I am a boarder of Rajendra Prasad Hall of Residence. I\u2019m from Kolkata and when I\u2019m not doing something productive (which is a lot of time), you\u2019ll probably find me watching anime or playing soccer. That\u2019s about it! Nice to meet you.\n\nHow did you get into Salesforce? What was the selection procedure?\n\nAfter resume shortlisting, the first round was a coding test. The next round for those shortlisted from the coding test was a technical interview round. For me, there was a personnel change halfway through, and the interview changed from a live coding round to a resume grilling and technical concept testing one. After some time, there was another personnel change, some non-technical questions were asked, and that was it. The entire interview lasted more than 1 and a half hours. The details of the interview are elaborated on below. After a few hours, I got a call about my selection.\n\nIn the first part of the interview, I was given a problem statement on a live coding platform. The interviewer was friendly, and he encouraged questions and clarified doubts, many of which were also hints in disguise. The problem was a practical one, and they mainly wanted to test the approach through which I arrived at the correct solution. It was based on an advanced implementation of binary search. The trick was figuring out which solution could be implemented practically with data sizes equal to any practical amount available in the real world.\n\nI started with a naive approach, discussed why it was not practical due to time-complexity issues and then arrived at binary search. After we agreed on the algorithm, I was asked to implement and run a full working code, taking my own inputs to check for all corner cases. Once they were satisfied with my code, there was a personnel change and they moved on to the resume grilling part.\n\nThey gave me the option to choose a project/internship from my resume and elaborate on every intricate detail. They listened to it carefully, understood everything fundamentally, and there were questions and counter-questions. Based on their understanding of my work in that project, they moved ahead with some basic OOPs design choice questions like inheritance, abstraction, encapsulation, which to use in which use cases, pros and cons of different design choices, and so on. They also asked for solutions if a code base is in a different language than what is to be used for a different purpose which uses that code base. Finally, they asked what happens if two programs try to access the same file at the same time and how to write code so as not to cause any conflicts.\n\nAfter the final personnel change, they asked some non-technical questions like, \u201cState an example from your previous experiences where there was a difference of opinion between team members and what part you played in resolving it.\u201d They also asked what the one thing was that I learned at my previous internships that I most definitely want to carry on in my future experiences. Overall, the entire interview process was enriching and enticing.\n\nHow to prepare for them?\n\nI revised my OS and OOPs concepts from my CS slides, which were all-encompassing. Geeksforgeeks also has some quick revision and common interview questions on the same, but I think the CS slides make the fundamentals much more stronger. For the coding test, CP is not needed as much as being able to solve leetcode and interviewbit hard questions. Although, CP does definitely add a certain level of confidence and ability boost.\n\nFor the live coding round, having clear DSA concepts and practising common interview questions should be enough, considering the person has enough skills to think, implement, debug, and reach the final solution of leetcode and interviewbit hard problems by himself. For the non-technical questions, just googling some common HR questions should do. All in all, a calm mind is necessary during the interview for your presence of mind to click in as that is most essential in dealing with all scenarios, even if they are unprecedented and unforeseen.\n\nWhat difficulties did you face while preparing for this Company/Profile? How did you overcome this problem?\n\nI was never a CP expert and hence I had a slow start in catching up. I talked to a bunch of my 4 year BTech friends who had their internships last year about how they dealt with this and gathered enough confidence that focussing just on mastering every topic from interviewbit and leetcode should give me a solid backbone.\n\nBeing from CS I had proper understanding of the algorithms and concepts from before so it was relatively easier to catch up on practicing enough to solve medium and hard problems by myself. Initially, when I struggled and wasted a lot of time and still couldn\u2019t solve the hard problems, my friends advised me to spend fixed amount of time in thinking, analyze the thought, read the editorial, try implementing it, use that idea in another problem, that\u2019s how I mastered the hard problems.\n\nAccording to you, who should ideally apply for this job?\n\nI think every single person should apply for this job, or at least aim to. Salesforce is a really versatile company and accepts interns from diverse backgrounds provided they satisfy their technical requirements.\n\nAny specific advice you want to give to the junta sitting for internships this year.\n\nIt\u2019s never too late to start coding, sit down, treat it like a game and keep levelling up non-stop.\n\nWhat are some of the major points you think would be valid to mention in your CV while targeting this profile?(any specific suggestions you would like to make?\n\nI don\u2019t know the metrics they use for resume shortlisting, I can only speculate. I think adding any projects or internships adds real value to the resume, no matter how small, even course projects work. Adding relevant coursework, languages, or toolkits most comfortable with is a must. Lastly, do feel free to reach out to me on LinkedIn/messenger/instagram for any further doubts you may have.

What was the selection procedure?\n\nOnline Coding Round:\n\n3 Questions\n\n- 2 easy, 1 easy-medium (< Codeforces div 2C level)\n\n- Did all 3 to get shortlisted for interviews\n\nRound 1: Coding Interview\n\nI was asked a few easy string manipulation questions to solve on an online IDE. Did all of them. Round 2: HR\n\nA lot of questions were asked from my CV, especially from a course term project (Software Engineering Lab). I was also asked why I wanted to join Salesforce, what I knew about Salesforce, etc.\n\nOverall I wasn\u2019t asked anything hard. The standard of questions drop a lot after day 1 in my experience. Compared to day 1 companies I was shortlisted in, (NK Securities, Sprinklr, Nutanix), these rounds were way simpler.\n\n3) How to prepare for them?\n\nFor SDE profiles, one must be somewhat experienced with CP. I\u2019d say at least reach specialist on codeforces / 4 stars on codechef. Have few projects. Won\u2019t help with any coding rounds/ tech interviews, but could help in HR rounds if the interviewer finds them intriguing. Most of the time during the HR interview, I was just answering questions related to my project.\n\n4) What difficulties did you face while preparing for this Company/Profile? How did you overcome this problem?\n\nI wasn\u2019t actually preparing specifically for Salesforce. I was targeting systems roles in quant firms. But yes, SDE roles for product companies were on my cards. I faced a lot of difficulty in raising my rating on codeforces, since I started CP after 4th semester (2.5 months before coding rounds). I did have some knowledge of algorithms thanks to the 3rd semester\u2019s algorithms course. Could not really escape this problem. It just takes time. Do NOT expect to be an expert right away at CP or at anything. It takes time.\n\nI was also really short on time to cover all topics. The only solution I had was to trim advanced topics. I completely skipped segment trees, advanced dp, tries, etc, since those are rarely asked in intern tests. These topics are asked in some companies though. (Ex: Google, sometimes in Quant firms, etc). Instead of learning new things in the nick of time, it\u2019s better to become proficient at things one has already studied about.\n\nI was quite slow in problem solving. As the tests are timed, this is a huge problem. I usually practiced the whole day and gave whatever contests were held at night. Doing timed contests is a sure way to develop speed.\n\n5) According to you, who should ideally apply for this job?\n\nAnyone targeting SDE roles in product companies. Also if you want to chill in your final year; Salesforce usually offers PPO at a higher rate than most other product companies, although it selects less interns from a single place (7 from KGP).\n\n6) Any specific advice you want to give to the junta sitting for internships this year.\n\nThere is no vacation for you peeps :)\n\nKGP has a lot of students sitting for internships, which means a lot of competition. Study thoroughly instead of trying to do everything, but I\u2019m sure you are painfully aware of this after the recent end\n\ninstead of trying to do everything, but I\u2019m sure you are painfully aware of this after the recent end semester.\n\nGive contests regularly as mentioned before. Do interviewbit / leetcode properly to get practice. Also keep in mind that only doing CP won\u2019t help you, since you need to have proper practice in all topics. If you don\u2019t have any projects, it\u2019s fine. Your first priority should be to get good enough to first clear those coding rounds.\n\n7) Kindly attach your resume. What are some of the major points you think would be valid to mention in your CV while targeting this profile?(any specific suggestions you would like to make?\n\nMake profile specific CVs if targeting multiple profiles. Do not try to cram everything like many do (even I did).\n\nFor ex: if you have an SDE profile, there is no use trying to write every POR you have ever got, which is not even remotely related to software, although being a member of kdag/koss/cgs etc is different, those are very worth writing in the CV imho.\n\nDo NOT have anything on the CV which you are not sure about / not well acquainted with. In case you are asked the same thing from the CV and you are unable to answer, it is safe to assume that you will most probably be rejected. Not being able to answer something from your CV is a HUGE problem, just don\u2019t write it in the first place."

I will be interning as a Software Developer at Reliance-Jio in the summer of 2023. This blog includes my CP background, preparation strategy, and experience in CDC codingrounds & interviews. I have been a huge follower of this CDC-blog series by SWG & I\u2019ll try to include all minor helpful details regarding the CDC internship drive at KGP, so yeah, this is going to be quite long!\n\n2) How did you get into Reliance? What was the selection procedure?\n\nReliance-Jio came for the first time to hire interns. Generally, they arrive for the Placement Session only. It was a Day-5 company. So,the selection process was easy and quite straightforward. It consisted of 1 coding round and 3 rounds of interviews. All the interview rounds were based on the CV and HR-related questions.In the coding round, 2 basic questions were asked. One was related to the Pascal triangle and the other was a basic implementation of a 2-pointer. The questions are at a level of CF div2 B in the sense implementation, but not as AdHoc as generally asked in Codechef or Codeforces. Anyone with 2\u20133 months of good practice in Interview Bit & Leetcode can handle this.\n\nAround 40\u201345 students got shortlisted for final interviews. I don\u2019t know why they kept 3 rounds of the same type of interviews. No coding questions were asked in any of the interviews. My CV had plenty of research projects and corporate internships related to Machine Learning and Deep Learning. They continuously asked for brief descriptions of each project in each round. In the second interview, HR was quite impressed by one of my projects mentioned in my CV related to UAV path optimization with the integration of the Bees Algorithm. They went deep into it, asking how Bees Algorithms work, their drawbacks, and how the traveling salesman problem (TSP) can be modified using this. At the end of the interview, they asked whether I am interested in further pursuing this project. They always expect an optimistic answer to such a question so, if your answer is NO, then also give a diplomatic answer. The interview went very well. In the last round, they asked some general HR questions like \u201cWhy should we hire you?\u201d, \u201cYour weakness?\u201d, \u201cWhat qualities do you have?\u201dand stuff like that. The last question they asked me was to name 5 products of Jio company that I was using.\n\n3) How to prepare for them?\n\nBe thorough with all your DSA problem-solving skills. Interview Bit and Leetcode are possibly the best resources out there to prepare for coding rounds. Apart from coding it is essential to be familiar with your CV. You should be well-versed with what you have written in your CV. Generally, they ask you from the highlighted technical terms in your CV. Mentioning something you haven\u2019t done yet in your CV, creates a very bad impression on the interviewer, probably resulting in exclusion from further rounds. Companies that come after day 3 generally prefer your CV and projects rather than asking tough DSA questions. Brushing up my CV helped me to\n\nscore some additional brownie points in Jio interviews. Also, I participated in CF and Atcoder contests regularly which certainly developed my problem-solving skills, but I didn\u2019t focus a lot on those contests. Please go through this blog written by Shivansh Shukla (Graviton), a very good friend of mine, to get brief info about all the Day 1 companies.\n\n4) What difficulties did you face while preparing for this Company/Profile? How did you overcome this problem?\n\nThe difficulty with preparing for a profile like SDE is not the lack of resources but it\u2019s quite the opposite. There are too many resources to make a beginner puzzled as to where to even start. The best solution will be to focus on just one particular resource and trust it blindly and unless you can solve a good chunk of the single resource you started with, don\u2019t look to anything else as it will confuse you more. That\u2019s the strategy I followed and I would recommend Leetcode and solving Interview Bit for revising later on.\n\n5) According to you, who should ideally apply for this job?\n\nAnyone having good problem-solving skills and the ability to grasp things quickly, as things change fast in the software field and would need to adapt and be flexible enough to adapt to these changes.\n\n6) Any specific advice you want to give to the junta sitting for internships this year.\n\nFor preparation:\n\n\u25cf Practice CP.\n\n\u25cf Try to learn the basics of OOPs, Computer Networks, OS, and DBMS (less important).\n\n\u25cf Dev-related projects may help.\n\n\u25cf POR(s) are not at all necessary.\n\nFor Interview:\n\n\u25cf The best advice would be to stay confident and believe in yourself.\n\n\u25cf The interviewer mainly wants to judge how well you think and approach a problem.\n\n\u25cf It is very important that while thinking about the problem\u2019s solution, you think out loud.\n\n\u25cf Keep talking with the interviewer about your approach so that even if you go wrong, he can give you a hint to get you back on track.\n\nAlong with focusing on DSA, do put a heavy emphasis on one specific thing I can think of as of writing this \u2014 For many Day 1/2 SDE profiles, be good at what you do. Know as much as algorithms,languages, computer science theory, as possible. If you are going to start into the CDC process you\u2019ll realize that it is so biased and the luck factor plays an important role here. You will not be shortlisted even after giving an overwhelming performance in the coding tests and your friend will be shortlisted easily. Just forget about all those negative thoughts and enjoy your CDC process junta. Always remember \u201cKARMA always WORKS.\u201d\n\n7) What are some of the major points you think would be valid to mention in your CV while targeting this profile?(any specific suggestions you would like to make?)\n\nThough I am preparing for SDE, Quant & Data profile simultaneously, I made a single CV. But you can make separate CVs for different profiles.\n\nFor Software & Quant roles, you can mention projects related to Development, core CS theoretical projects done under any professor, FT(many people do it), and Data Science. You can also mention Google Kickstart ranks (under 1000 preferable), ICPC ranks (qualified for regionals could be the golden word of your CV), in general, Codeforces (please mention you have at least >1350), and Codechef (> 4*).\n\nFor a Data profile, you can look at my CV. It is very well written. For this profile, they generally expect at least 1\u20132 research projects and you should have a good command of Python, DBMS, and SQL. Please mention Python libraries that you know, in your CV. Onsite foreign projects under 100 QS-ranked universities enlighten your CV for this profile especially.\n\nIn general, you can mention JEE ranks, Olympiad achievements, Skills & Expertise, PORs (must for Consultancy profile), and Extracurricular activities (must for consultancy profile) for all the profiles."

        "content": "FORESIGHT(2023): Summer Internship at Glean| Aryan Singh|\n\n--\n\nListen\n\nBrief Introduction\n\nAs a final year dual degree student from the department of Computer Science and Engineering, IIT KGP, I have always been passionate about software development and problem-solving. Therefore, I was thrilled to learn about the SWE intern role at Glean, a growing company that offers many new challenges in the field of software development. In this blog, I will share my experience of getting selected for the SWE intern role at Glean and provide some tips for aspiring students who are looking for internships in this field.\n\nHow did I get into Glean? What was the selection procedure?\n\nI got an internship at Glean through an on-campus drive. They were one of the Day-1 companies, and the selection process involved a CV shortlisting followed by two technical interview rounds. The interviews mainly focused on testing my problem-solving skills and involved questions about data structures and algorithms.\n\nHow did I prepare for the interviews?\n\nTo prepare for the interviews, I focused on improving my problem-solving skills by practicing on Interview Bit and LeetCode. However, I was not aware of the interview pattern for the SWE intern role at Glean, so I started watching mock interviews of Google, Meta, and other companies to learn how to structure my answers and handle follow-up questions.\n\nWhat difficulties did I face while preparing, and how did I overcome them?\n\nOne of the difficulties I faced while preparing for this profile was the lack of knowledge about the interview pattern. However, by watching mock interviews, I was able to overcome this problem and gain a better understanding of what to expect in the interviews.\n\nWho should ideally apply for this job?\n\nIn my opinion, students who are passionate about solving real-world problems through software development and have strong problem-solving skills would be ideal candidates for the SWE intern role at Glean. As a growing company that has built its first iteration of the product, Glean offers many new challenges, such as scalability, efficiency, and harnessing large language models (LLMs) to solve enterprise-level problems. Therefore, individuals who enjoy solving complex problems and want to gain experience in a fast-paced startup environment would be an ideal fit for this role.\n\nAny specific advice you want to give to the junta sitting for internships this year?\n\nIf you are starting from scratch, I would strongly recommend mastering the Standard Template Library (STL), watching videos, and practicing on Interview Bit and LeetCode. I would suggest avoiding contests for now and focusing on solving more questions on these websites. Once you have attained adequate knowledge, you will be in a good position for interviews. In the meantime, you should also brush up on your Object-Oriented Programming (OOPs), Operating Systems (OS), and Networks courses.\n\nWhat are some of the major points you think would be valid to mention in your CV while targeting this profile?\n\nWhile targeting the SWE intern profile at Glean, it is better to have a good full-stack project in your CV as it allows interviewers to ask many theoretical questions. For example, they can ask about the ACID properties of databases, the four pillars of OOPs, or why you used Flask instead of Django or MySQL instead of MongoDB. It is advisable to give sufficient time and importance to the projects that you mention on your CV. Therefore, I would suggest highlighting any relevant projects or experiences you have had in the software development domain and clearly mentioning the technologies and tools you have used. Additionally, it would be beneficial to mention any relevant coursework or certifications you have completed in the field of computer science.\n\nIn conclusion, I would like to wish all aspiring students the best of luck in their pursuit of internships and careers in the field of software development. I would like to thank my parents, God, and the Career Development Cell (CDC) for the internship that I got."

        "info": "For the technical interviews, you can practice saying your logic along with coding the problem.",
        "content": "FORESIGHT(2023): Summer Internship at Cisco | Dhruv Rathi|\n\n--\n\nListen\n\n1) Brief Introduction\n\nI am Dhruv Rathi, a 3rd-year undergraduate student from the Department of Electronics and Electrical Communication Engineering at IIT Kharagpur. I am from Durgapur, West Bengal. I was the Tech Head at the Student Welfare Group and General Secretary Technology of LLR Hall for the academic session 2022\u201323. I have an interest in problem-solving and development. I am currently doing my summer internship at Cisco Systems in the software developer profile.\n\n2) How did you get into Cisco? What was the selection procedure?\n\nThe selection process for Cisco Systems consisted of one online test and 3 rounds of interviews.\n\nThe online test consisted of 2 sections:\n\ni) DSA questions\n\nii) MCQs related to computer science fundamentals, which included OOPS, OS, and computer networks mainly.\n\nI was able to solve the DSA questions but found the MCQ part a bit difficult as I had not prepared for OS and computer networks at that time. Still, I was shortlisted for the interviews.\n\nOne night before the interviews, I searched for what type of questions Cisco asks in their interviews and found that they do focus on computer networks and OS. As I did not have much time, I went through some GFG blogs on TCP/IP and OSI models.\n\nThe interviews were scheduled through Cisco Webex.\n\nThe first interview was a technical one, and it lasted for around 45 minutes. In this interview I was asked some questions related to pointers in C. Then I was also asked one DSA question. The interviewer was very inclined to ask questions about OS and computer networks. So in cases like this, if you have not prepared the topic thoroughly, you should try to dodge the question by saying it was not in your coursework and try to direct the interview to the topics that you have prepared well. I did the same, but in this case, the interviewer was very strong-willed to know whatever I knew about CN. So, I told him whatever I could recollect from the blogs I read.\n\nThe 2nd round of interviews was technical + situation-based or managerial questions. This was also around 30 minutes.\n\nThere was a question in this interview where I was asked, \u201cIf there is a program for an elevator, then what are the test cases we should give to check the program, and what can be the edge cases?\u201d\n\nI was also asked questions related to the projects and internships on my CV.\n\nThe last interview was an HR round, which lasted for 7 minutes.\n\nIt started with my introduction, in which I also briefly included my internships and projects.\n\nThen I was asked questions about what Cisco does and why I wanted to join it. In questions like this, you should try to impress the interviewer by saying how the company impacts the world.\n\nAfter that, he asked about my location preferences, and the interview concluded.\n\n3) How to prepare for them?\n\nFor the online test rounds:\n\nPrepare DSA thoroughly (this is common for all software companies). I would also like to add that give as many coding competitions as possible. This would help you solve the questions fast in the coding rounds of companies.\n\nAlong with that, prepare topics like OOPS, as it is also asked in the coding tests of some companies. Specifically for Cisco, you can try to cover computer networks also through blogs of GFG and interviewbit.\n\nFor the technical interviews, you can practice saying your logic along with coding the problem. Some companies have their coding platforms where they will tell you to code and then check for test cases. For others, they can tell you to code on google docs or paper (in the case of offline interviews). One can practice for these with their friends. Also, try to give some mock interviews before the CDC interviews start.\n\nOne piece of advice from my side is that for whichever company you are shortlisted for interviews, search the net to see what questions or topics the company focuses on in interviews and prepare accordingly.\n\nFor HR rounds:\n\nThere are some fixed sets of questions that are asked by HR, and you should have an answer prepared for them beforehand. Many times, at the end of the interview, the interviewer might ask if you have any questions for him/her. So I would suggest preparing some questions for them as well. You can find the answers to these things online.\n\n4) What difficulties did you face while preparing for this Company/Profile? How did you overcome this problem?\n\nAs I mentioned earlier, I had not prepared the OS and computer networks, so that was a disadvantage for me. The thing I liked about Cisco Systems was that they took all three rounds of interviews for everyone who was shortlisted and then selected on the basis of the aggregate of the three rounds. As my 2nd and 3rd rounds went well, I was finally selected.\n\nIn CDC, it is very important that no matter how good/bad your previous interview went, it should not reflect on the next interview. On some days, you can have multiple interviews with different companies, and this becomes very important during that time. It can happen that you felt the interview went very well, but you are still not selected. So, you should be mentally prepared for situations like this. In situations like this, it will be good to talk with your seniors, as they must have gone through similar situations and can help you with your problems.\n\n5) According to you, who should ideally apply for this job?\n\nAnyone who is aiming for the software profile should apply to Cisco Systems.\n\n6) Any specific advice you want to give to the junta sitting for internships this year?\n\nIt is important that you focus on one profile and prepare for it thoroughly. There will be many distractions in your peer group, but you should be clear on what you should be doing.\n\nYou should never hesitate to talk to or take advice from any senior, but again, remember that even if you take advice from many people, the final decision on what should be done is yours. So prepare smartly, and in the end, everything will be sorted!\n\n7) What are some of the major points you think would be valid to mention in your CV while targeting this profile? (any specific suggestions you would like to make?)\n\nFor software roles, the most important part of the CV is the projects and internship section. So expect to get questions related to your projects. Prepare them properly, and you should be able to defend whatever you write in your CV."

        "content": "FORESIGHT(2023): Summer Internship at AlphaGrep | Sidharth Vishwakarma |\n\n--\n\n1\n\nListen\n\n1) Brief Introduction\n\nHi everyone, I am Sidharth Vishwakarma, a third-year Computer Science and Engineering undergraduate student at IIT Kharagpur. I\u2019ll be interning at AlphaGrep Securities in the summer of 2023 as a Software Developer.\n\n2) How did you get into AlphaGrep? What was the selection procedure?\n\nThe role was open only for circuital departments like CS, MA, EC, EE, and IM. The selection procedure consists of an intense coding round followed by an interview or a series of interviews.\n\nThe coding round had 5 CP questions to be solved in 90 mins. They were from a varying range of difficulties. The first question was a typical linked list query. The second was an interactive problem based on finding a sink in the graph. Third was a medium ad-hoc question using priority queues and binary search operations like lower and upper bound. The fourth was based on bitmasking. Finally, the fifth one was on level order search in a binary tree.\n\nThe interview was a bit tough, with questions based on DSA and some concepts from C++, like virtual functions, dynamic polymorphism, and shared pointers. It is also recommended that you should know some basics of system design and memory management.\n\n3) How to prepare for them?\n\nMost of your preparation time will be involved around Data Structures and Algorithms. Apart from this, it would be best to know C++ OOPS concepts. AlphaGrep tests your C++ knowledge for the Software Development Role, as most work involves C++.\n\nThey also sometimes test your systems knowledge with questions from Operating Systems and Computer Networks. Therefore, it would be handy if you had some knowledge of them.\n\nKeep your CG as high as possible. As far as I can remember AlphaGrep doesn\u2019t specify any CG cutoff, but they shortlisted only those students with a CG \u2265 9.30.\n\n4) What difficulties did you face while preparing for this Company/Profile? How did you overcome this problem\n\nI was having a lot of problems initially with CP and DSA. I always struggled to solve medium-hard problems on coding platforms like Codeforces. My consistency and persistence in doing the DSA problems was the key to overcoming this, eventually leading to better results.\n\n5) According to you, who should ideally apply for this job?\n\nThe job is most suited for any individual who-\n\nHaving some suitable coursework, research projects, or open-source activities, ideally in C++, is a plus point.\n\n6) Any specific advice you want to give to the junta sitting for internships this year?\n\nIf you are preparing for SDE roles, try keeping DSA and CP skills as high as possible. Maintain your CG and accept to face rejection. Sometimes you may have performed well in a company interview but weren\u2019t selected, but on the other hand, you get selected for a company in which you had very little chance. Try to do as much as you can. Sometimes you won\u2019t get what you expected, but be consistent and keep confidence in yourself.\n\n7) What are some of the major points you think would be valid to mention in your CV while targeting this profile? (any specific suggestions you would like to make?)\n\nDay 1 companies like AlphaGrep and many other HFTs mostly overlook your CV. The only thing they are looking for in your CV is your Department and CG. It\u2019s highly preferred that you are from a circuital department with a CG > 9. Apart from this, these companies only need good programming and mathematical ability."

        "content": "FORESIGHT(2023): Summer Internship at Sprinklr | Gaurav Malakar |\n\n--\n\n2\n\nListen\n\n1) Brief Introduction\n\nHello everyone! My name is Gaurav Malakar, and I am currently a 3rd-year undergraduate student pursuing a BTech course in Computer Science and Engineering. I am excited to share that I recently secured an internship opportunity as a Product Engineering Intern at Sprinklr, a well-known IT company. In this blog, I will walk you through my journey and provide valuable insights into the steps I took to land this internship role.\n\n2) How did you get into Sprinklr? What was the selection procedure?\n\nCV Submission: To apply for the position, I had to submit my CV through the ERP system. Fortunately, Sprinklr did not have an explicit CGPA cutoff, allowing a wide range of students to apply and be selected for the coding round.\n\nCoding Test: The coding test at Sprinklr was relatively straightforward compared to other Day-1 companies. It consisted of three questions focused on Data Structures and Algorithms. Although I don\u2019t recall the exact questions, one of them was a simple array problem, while the other two were graph-based problems. Candidates who were able to solve at least two questions successfully moved on to the next round of selection.\n\nInterview Round-1: During this interview round, I had a pleasant experience with a friendly interviewer. After introducing myself, we moved on to the technical questions. The first question was challenging dynamic programming (DP) problem, which I tackled successfully due to my familiarity with such problems. Next, I was presented with a recursion-based question that involved implementing a JSON-like class in C++. The interviewer provided specific requirements and functions, and I was able to code them accordingly. Additionally, I faced an object-oriented programming (OOP) question where I had to design a company hierarchy using classes. The interviewer gave detailed requirements for the system and posed various questions while I worked on the solution. Throughout the interview, I maintained a continuous interaction with the interviewer and incorporated feedback into my code. All the coding in this round was done on google docs.\n\nInterview Round-2: This round was purely based on CP. I was asked 2 questions, both of which were moderately hard. The first question was based on multisource BFS, and the second question was based on the Level Order Traversal of the Binary tree but can be optimized for special cases. In this round, the interviewer allowed me to use any IDE of my choice. The round Lasted for 45 minutes.\n\nHR Round: The HR round was a real head-scratcher for me. The HR representative fired away with a series of questions that left me feeling like I was in the middle of a comedy skit. Here\u2019s a breakdown of the memorable moments:\n\n\u201cTell me about a hard situation in your life that you overcame.\u201d It felt like I was in a movie, searching for that one challenging moment that tested my resilience and determination.\n\n\u201cTell me what Sprinklr does.\u201d Oh, the infamous \u201cexplain the company\u201d question. Suddenly, my mind went blank, and I felt like I was trying to explain rocket science to a toddler. Somehow, I managed to fumble my way through it with a generous sprinkling of flattery for the tech team.\n\nAnd then came the dreaded question: \u201cWhich is your favorite company?\u201d I found myself in a tricky spot because I couldn\u2019t simply say \u201cSprinklr.\u201d This question seemed more daunting than all the complex DSA questions I faced earlier. It required me to tap into my inner politician and carefully navigate my way through the answer.\n\nDespite the twists and turns, I somehow managed to survive the HR round with a mix of creativity, quick thinking, and perhaps a touch of luck. Life has a way of throwing curveballs at us, but it\u2019s how we handle them that counts.\n\n3) How to prepare for them?\n\nThe things that you should prepare are DSA, Projects, and also OOP. Let\u2019s check out these topics in a little more detail:-\n\nDSA (Data Structures and Algorithms): This is the most important topic you need to prepare for. I was introduced to DSA during my Algorithms-1 course, and I also supplemented my learning with additional topics from YouTube. Many of my friends have taken the AlgoZenith course and found it very useful. However, if you already have prior knowledge of DSA, you can consider skipping AlgoZenith and learning from YouTube instead. During my preparation, I also solved problems from a website called InterviewBit, which I recommend starting around 1.5 months before coding rounds. Additionally, I regularly participated in coding contests on Codeforces.\n\nProjects: It is highly recommended to include at least one project on your CV. In my case, I included a term project and an assignment. If you are short on time, you can also include simpler projects. However, it is important to note that lying in the project description can be risky, as interviewers may ask questions about those topics. Luckily, I wasn\u2019t questioned about my project during my interview, but some of my friends faced extensive questioning regarding their projects. Therefore, it\u2019s crucial to choose your projects wisely.\n\nIf you have limited knowledge beyond C++, you can still work on simple projects using Python or JavaScript. These languages are beginner-friendly, and it\u2019s possible to complete a project in either of them within two weeks or less.\n\nOOP (Object-Oriented Programming): I was asked one question about OOP during my interview. To prepare for this topic, I studied articles from Geeks For Geeks (GFG) and watched YouTube videos. OOP is generally considered an easier topic, and it\u2019s common for Day-1 or Day-2 companies to ask questions about it.\n\nMiscellaneous: In addition to the aforementioned topics, I also dedicated some time to learning puzzles, although they didn\u2019t come in handy as much. However, some HFT (High-Frequency Trading) companies did ask puzzle questions in their interviews. To further prepare for interview rounds, I conducted mock interviews with my friends. We would select questions for each other and utilize Google Docs for coding.\n\n4) What difficulties did you face while preparing for this Company/Profile? How did you overcome this problem?\n\nI didn\u2019t focus my preparation on any specific company. The topics I learned were commonly asked in many companies. Throughout my preparation, I encountered some challenges, such as not having a clear direction and occasionally lacking motivation during the three-month period. Fortunately, people who choose AlgoZenith, probably won\u2019t face these issues. However, for others, I highly recommend creating a roadmap for each topic you plan to learn during your preparation. Having a roadmap was instrumental in overcoming the challenge of not having a clear path to follow.\n\n5) According to you, who should ideally apply for this job?\n\nAnyone with a passion for programming can apply for this opportunity. The company is experiencing rapid growth, making it an excellent starting point for individuals aspiring to pursue a career as a software developer.\n\n6) Any specific advice you want to give to the junta sitting for internships this year.\n\nA valuable piece of practical advice I would like to share is \u201cNever leave your fate in someone else\u2019s hands.\u201d If you believe that you can bag an internship solely through the help of a friend, remember that the chances of success are quite slim. Instead, invest your energy in thorough preparation. It\u2019s not necessary to work intensely for long hours. Instead, focus on maintaining consistency. Dedicate a moderate amount of time each day (around 5\u20138 hours) to studying rather than cramming for 12 hours on certain days.\n\n7) Kindly attach your resume. What are some of the major points you think would be valid to mention in your CV while targeting this profile? (any specific suggestions you would like to make?)\n\nSome major points to mention in your CV would be:-"

What was the selection procedure?\n\nI got into DE Shaw through the CDC internship process that happens at the beginning of 4th year for dual and at the beginning of 3rd year for Btech students.\n\nDE Shaw consisted of 3 questions where each question was supposed to solved within the time limit provided and you could not carry forward the time from one question to the another. The questions were of moderate difficulty with the problems ranging between 1400 to 1700 rating on codeforces. The test included mostly adhoc, greedy and DP questions. People who solved all the 3 questions were only considered for the interviews.\n\nHow to prepare for them?\n\nPreparation for DE Shaw is similar to all the SDE companies that come on Day 1 / 2 on the campus. I mostly prepared using Codeforces and Codechef website, but I also recommend people to look at the CSES problem set as well as the Atcoder educational DP contest. Giving regular contests and up solving them after the contest does most of the preparation for the coding tests. Coming to proficiency in CP, I would say you should be someone who is able to solve ~1800 rated problems on Codeforces with minor help if you are targeting Day 1 companies.\n\nApart from CP you also need to have a good command over OOPS concepts as they are frequently asked during the interviews of companies. I mostly prepared for OOPs by reading blogs on GFG and also reading interview experience articles on GFG. Sometimes companies also tend to ask questions from OS, and therefore, I had prepared for OS as well, and it came in handy at DE Shaw as they asked a lot of OS in my interviews. But I would say if you are short on time you can skip the OS bit as it is not that important.\n\nWhat difficulties did you face while preparing for this Profile? How did you overcome this problem\n\nThe biggest problem that I, along with probably everyone that did CP faced was rating stagnation, where you continuously give contests and practice problems, but your rating does not improve or even worse, sometimes degrades. It is a very disheartening situation to be in, but you must realize that results and efforts don\u2019t follow a linear curve. In the beginning, you might not see any results, but all of a sudden, you might see all the results, and this is something you must believe in.\n\nYou must constantly back yourself up and keep your morale high, as in the end not giving up will make all the difference. I know it\u2019s easier said than done, but I guess that\u2019s the challenge.\n\nAccording to you, who should ideally apply for this job?\n\nAnyone who is interested in the field of software engineering, machine learning, or quant can apply for this job as there are profiles in DE Shaw that cater to these skill sets.\n\nAny specific advice you want to give to the junta sitting for internships this year?\n\nThe entire CDC internship process is a stressful time and many times you will feel like you have done nothing compared to others, but just have faith in your preparation. Remember that it is just a 2 months internship in your probably 25+ years of career ahead so it\u2019s not the end of the world if you don\u2019t get it. Also, make sure to have a good friend circle to practice together and conduct mock interviews with each other.\n\nRemember that luck is an important factor and sometimes you just can\u2019t help it, so don\u2019t necessarily think that not getting a Day 1 or Day 2 captures your capability. There are plenty of opportunities outside and believe in yourself and your abilities\n\nWhat are some of the major points you think would be valid to mention in your CV while targeting this profile?(any specific suggestions you would like to make?)\n\nYou can mention some software / ML related projects that you have completed, this becomes even more important in certain companies that purely do CV shortlisting for the interviews. The use of proper formatting and grammatical statements such as action words, etc. in a CV is very important. I would ask you to go through some reference CVs of seniors or on the Internet to get an idea of what needs to be done.\n\nParticularly for SDE companies, PORs don\u2019t matter so if you are targeting these roles I would say focusing your time on off-campus internships or projects is the way to go.\n\nLast but not least CGPA matters and so don\u2019t screw it up in any case, try to keep it as high as possible."

I am Parv Jain, a fourth-year undergraduate student of the Department of Electrical Engineering enrolled in its B.Tech course of Instrumentation Engineering. My professional interests lie in Data Science and Analytics including the development part and I often indulge in various extracurricular activities in my leisure time.\n\nHow did you get into Honeywell? What was the selection procedure?\n\nThere are three rounds of the selection process for Honeywell. The first round is a coding test that consists of 3 questions of medium difficulty level that could be easily solved if you have been practicing DSA for a decent time (here I mean at least 2 months of consistency).\n\nThe second round is the technical interview where they test your technical knowledge mainly using interview topics like oops, pseudo-code of basic CP questions, probability and statistics, and puzzles. You can also expect CV grilling in this round as in my case I was asked only on my CV [Past projects and experiences].\n\nThe third and final round is the cultural interview which is mostly just a formality and is taken by the HR of the company. It's just to check whether you are a good fit for the company\u2019s work environment. Before going to this round, it's better to prepare about the company a little bit [its recent projects, main domain of work, and latest company leaders and news.]\n\nHow to prepare for them?\n\nTo prepare for the coding test, you need to practice Data Structures and Algorithms thoroughly to cover all topics at a medium difficulty level at least. I prepared for it from Algozenith and then practiced questions on platforms like Interview Bit and Leetcode. This would give you a good grasp of mostly all types of questions asked in these kinds of coding tests.\n\nThere are some specific topics that you need to cater to for the technical interview part. Topics like OOPS, Time Complexities, Pseudo code of basic algorithms and problems. Apart from it, you should be very thorough with your CV as there are very high chances of the interviewer starting with your past projects and if you have a good grasp on them then there you go!\n\nYou could drive the interview towards your side as happened in my case. There is no such preparation required for the last or the cultural round which is taken by the HR of the company. For that you should be familiar with the domains the company works in, its recent projects, and the latest company news.\n\nWhat difficulties did you face while preparing for this Company/Profile? How did you overcome this problem?\n\nThe major problem I faced was getting acquainted with and maintaining consistency in competitive programming. I started it (sincerely) in the month of May and I had just the next 3 months to make it to a mark.\n\nThe only way I found to overcome this is to think of every question you do as a milestone and feel a sense of achievement after solving it. This way you will realize your progress day by day.\n\nTip: Cover theory in as less time as possible and try to practice as many questions as possible (majorly from Interview Bit)\n\nThe other problem could be seeing your friends preparing and learning at a very fast rate. Try to avoid such discussions and just focus on your preparation, and your pace of learning.\n\nAccording to you, who should ideally apply for this job?\n\nThis is a Software Development Engineer role, therefore the people who have a high inclination towards development as well as coding should prefer this role. Also, the people who are interested in AI/ML can also go for it as there is a good chance that your project is based on these domains as well.\n\nAny specific advice you want to give to the junta sitting for internships this year?\n\nOne specific piece of advice I would like to give is that don\u2019t be very specific with any company or role because there are not many companies for each and every role during CDC internships, hence in order to increase your chances to bag an internship through CDC, try to broaden your spectrum as much as possible.\n\nWhat are some of the major points you think would be valid to mention in your CV while targeting this profile?\n\nFor a software profile, there are as such no specific points to keep in mind but as a general opinion, try to have spikes in your CV by which I mean include projects, internships (if any), achievements, positions of responsibility (not of much importance in software profile) as well as extracurriculars. Prepare your CV thoroughly before going to an interview."

        "content": "FORESIGHT(2023): Summer Internship at Honeywell |Rithick Prabakar|\n\n--\n\nListen\n\nBrief Introduction\n\nHello folks! I am Rithick Prabakar, a third-year undergraduate student in the Department of Mechanical Engineering. I will join Honeywell as an SDE intern in the summer of 2023.\n\nHow did you get into Honeywell? What was the selection procedure?\n\nThe first round was the preliminary coding round. It was conducted on Hackerrank and consisted of 3 questions. All three were pretty easy if one has had a decent amount of practice. Then I had my technical interview and HR round. At first, a straightforward question was asked. After answering it, the question was modified into a more complex one. After solving that one, I was asked to explain my ongoing research project. Next, I was called for the HR round. It was concluded with a \"Do you have any questions for us?\" and a call from CDC confirming the offer.\n\nHow to prepare for them?\n\nThe first step for a software profile is a good grasp of data structures and algorithms. Here are some of the great resources I found: -\n\nIntroduction to Algorithms MIT OCW (This is gold! Make sure to follow the latest playlist for updated algorithms)\n\nIntroduction to Algorithms book by Thomas H Cormen et al. (This is an excellent book for theory. You know, for the people who love to read the book after the lecture. Amazing if you read it. If you have no motivation for a giant book, not much loss.)\n\nYou have the gist of all the algorithms and data structures by now. Now the next best thing is to focus on relevant topics rather than learning everything in detail. If you program in Python, that's good, but learning CPP would be significant. The reason is that it's a low-level language than Python and is excellent for coding the answers (STL is paradise). But always go with your most confident programming language. To learn CPP, I'd suggest the following videos:\n\nComplete CPP (This course covers everything, including OOPs concepts, implementing them, and all advanced CPP)\n\nShorter CPP(If you are overwhelmed by 31 hours, then these 4 hours cover all the core concepts needed for you to build your skills)\n\nSTL Video (This guy explains complete STL and implements them in C++. Awesome!)\n\nSTL\u00a0(Don't feel like watching too many videos? Then use this to learn the ultimate power of CPP)\n\nFrom the above resources, you covered everything needed to indulge in specific topics. The above would equip you from a complete starter to writing your code. The important topics are Dynamic Programming or DP, Graphs, Bit manipulation, Trees, and Heaps.\n\nDynamic Programming (Common DP questions with code)\n\nGraphs (Common Graph questions with code)\n\nBit Manipulation (It pretty much covers all the necessary tactics for bit manipulation needed for coding tests)\n\nAnd finally, read about code readability. It would greatly help while coding to keep track. With these, you have all the necessary knowledge of DSA. And while doing all this, you can do either of the two things. Suppose you have a lot of time (more than 5 months). In that case, giving contests in CodeForces is an excellent way to acquaint yourself with solving questions in time constraints.\n\nYou will also gain a ton of confidence to solve questions. But if you start preparing during the summers for interns, it would be challenging to solve more than 3 questions in Div. 2. And of course, if you can, keep going. Else it would kill the confidence. Rather than giving contests, focus on solving them from the archive with ratings sorted. This would provide a lot of confidence (confidence does wonders). To get habituated to solving questions under time constraints, Grimoire of Code does weekly contests with previous year CDC questions (kudos!). On top of it, a time-to-time contest from Codeforces/CodeChef for the time-constraint practice.\n\nLastly, Interviewbit bucket questions. Leetcode substitutes too. They have the previous year's questions appropriately sorted and only a handful. While doing theory, coding them simultaneously dramatically helps when wholly dedicated to solving questions. Some extra resources are given below:\n\nCP Algorithms (All CP things in sorted manner)\n\nNumber Theory(Number theory)\n\nCracking the coding interview by McDowell (For interview questions + HR questions)\n\nTips and Tricks for Interview (Most interview tips and tricks are compiled into one post)\n\nWhatever you do, be very consistent. Consistency is the key. Also, don't neglect core cs concepts like Operating Systems and Database Management Systems. OOPS too. There are a good number of resources available for them.\n\nWhat difficulties did you face while preparing for this Company/Profile? How did you overcome this problem?\n\nI had no problems with the algorithm's theory part. I have been involved in them since my high school. But the major problem was that I had no programming practice. I had a fantastic grip on CPP, so the only problem was implementing the algorithms. Even with plenty of time, I didn't show consistency in CodeForces or CodeChef (5 or 6 contests). When CDC arrived, I realized I had wasted a lot of opportunities. The only programming practice I had was in HackerRank. To overcome this, I totally focused on interviewbit and GoC contests. This gave me the base to code my paper-written algorithms. In conclusion, code what you learn simultaneously.\n\nAccording to you, who should ideally apply for this job?\n\nI haven't yet done my internship, so I wouldn't specify anything. But on a gist, it's for people interested in software, programming, and problem-solving.\n\nAny specific advice you want to give to the junta sitting for internships this year.\n\nDon't be overwhelmed by the entire CDC process. A lot of factors might demotivate you. You might have tests late at night and interviews in the early morning. To refresh, hang out with friends, do a 2.2, and take a chill pill. If you face any issues, reach out to your friends and seniors. Stay away from Facebook and LinkedIn, if possible.\n\nDon't lose heart if you are rejected. Face it. For all the work you have done, for all the efforts you have put in, you will definitely get what you deserve. Remember that CDC is just another phase and will eventually pass. It is not the end.\n\nWhat are some of the major points you think would be valid to mention in your CV while targeting this profile? (any specific suggestions you would like to make?)\n\nRelevant projects for the profile are always a great point. That also includes your self-projects and internships. If they are relevant to SDE, then adding them is good. Adding your CF/CC rating is always a plus. That also includes your code jam/hash code/Hackercup highest ranks. Group projects show you are a good team player. Relevant hackathons also offer your competitive skill. Remember, you might be questioned about whatever is written on your curriculum vitae. Get your CV reviewed by seniors to improve them."

        "content": "FORESIGHT(2023): Summer Internship at Google | Rashi Patil |\n\n--\n\nListen\n\n1) Brief Introduction\n\nHello everyone! I\u2019m Rashi Patil, a third-year undergraduate student from the Department of Electronics and Electrical Communication Engineering enrolled in its B.Tech course. I am a Boarder of SN/IG Hall of Residence. I got an internship offer from Google through the on-campus CDC drive last year (2022\u201323).\n\n2) How did you get into Google? What was the selection procedure?\n\nGoogle opens only for Students with Majors in Circuital departments (CS, ECE, EE, MnC, and IM) \u201cand/or\u201d Minors in Circuital departments \u201cand/or\u201d Micro specializations in Circuital courses. The selection process involved one coding round followed by two technical interview rounds. The coding test was conducted on the HackerEarth platform in which two questions were given to solve in 60 mins. Later, based on your score on the test and your CV, shortlisted people are allotted some panels for interviews.\n\nRound-1 (45 min): The interview started with an introduction. After this, I was given a medium-level 2-pointer problem. I quickly explained my logic and then jumped to the implementation. After this, the interviewer asked me a follow-up question about a K-pointer scenario. I went on to extend my 2-pointer solution to a k-pointer problem while discussing it with the interviewer and came up with a solution. Although, due to time constraints, I couldn\u2019t implement the solution completely, the interviewer seemed happy and satisfied with my logic.\n\nRound-2 (45 min): The interview started with an introduction. After this, I was given a medium-level Dynamic Programming problem. I quickly explained my logic and then jumped to the implementation. The interviewer went on to ask a few tricky questions related to the STLs I was using in my implementation. After completing the implementation, the interviewer asked me a follow-up question, to which we discussed a few approaches and came up with a greedy solution. He didn\u2019t ask me to code it.\n\nBoth the interviewers were quite friendly and helpful.\n\n3) How to prepare for them?\n\nA thorough understanding of algorithms and data structures is required for software engineering-based profiles. Once the basics of DSA are clear, there are many sources to practice problem-solving. If you are a beginner, then refer to Leetcode and InterviewBit. Once you feel confident in standard DSA, you can participate in competitive programming contests on codeforces to boost your problem-solving ability.\n\nFor Google, much importance is given to the candidate\u2019s resume, especially past Kickstart/Codejam performances. So, make sure to participate in these contests.\n\nCS core concepts like OOPS, DBMS, OS, etc., are also recommended if you are aiming for Day-1 or Day-2 companies. If you have a rough idea about them, you can just keep these for the end and prepare them two weeks before the interviews. Although Google doesn\u2019t ask these in any round but some companies do.\n\n4) What difficulties did you face while preparing for this Company/Profile? How did you overcome this problem\n\nToo much to prepare in less time, I overcame this problem by carefully designing my study plan for the entire summer vacation before CDC. Also, there were times when I felt stuck and demotivated; maintaining consistency at such times was very challenging. In fact, I used to read such blogs of students who got internships through the CDC to keep myself motivated. I didn\u2019t feel very confident in the dynamic programming-related problems. So, to overcome this, I moved to leetcode and solved enough questions until I felt confident in it.\n\n5) According to you, who should ideally apply for this job?\n\nThis profile is recommended for anyone who is good at problem-solving and enjoys coding and software development. There is a lot of scope for learning new technologies and skills during the internship.\n\n6) Any specific advice you want to give to the junta sitting for internships this year?\n\nStart preparing a bit early on, and be consistent throughout your preparation journey. Try to solve as many problems as you can while understanding the logic deeply to the roots of every problem. Give more contests on codeforces/CodeChef and get a hold of CP. The journey will be challenging, fun, and sometimes stressful. There will be times when you will feel demotivated. Don\u2019t give up, and keep pushing forward. Make a group and practice; this will help with motivation. Plan your journey well so that you can utilize your time to the fullest. Keep revising the concepts you study.\n\nTry to stay confident and happy in the interviews. The interviewer mainly wants to judge how well you think and approach a problem. It is very important that while thinking about the problem\u2019s solution, you think out loud.\n\nKeep talking with the interviewer about your approach so that even if you go wrong, he can give you a hint to get you back on track.\n\nAll the best, Everyone!\n\n7) What are some of the major points you think would be valid to mention in your CV while targeting this profile? (Any specific suggestions you would like to make?)\n\nProjects and internships indicate hands-on experience, which interviewers generally take good note of. Projects can be anything from self-projects to course projects. Try to participate in as many programming contests as possible and write those ranks/ratings that will be useful during shortlisting. PoRs aren\u2019t really required for this profile.\n\nBe honest with what you represent in your CV. Be ready to be grilled upon anything you write on the CV."

        "content": "FORESIGHT(2023): Summer Internship at Honeywell | Utkarshini Dubey |\n\n--\n\nListen\n\n1) Brief Introduction\n\nHey everyone. I am Utkarshini Dubey, a 3rd-year undergraduate student from the Department of Industrial and Systems Engineering, IIT Kharagpur, enrolled in its Btech 4-year course. I am about to intern at Honeywell in the summer of 2023. I offer my experience in this blog in the hope that it would be useful to someone going through the CDC process.\n\n2) How did you get into Honeywell? What was the selection procedure?\n\nApplying on ERP and CV preparation: The CDC process officially began in June end when we had to start preparing our CVs. This requires a lot of time and patience. Preparing a CV in a rush is not at all recommended. Reaching out to some seniors who sat for similar profiles and getting your CV verified by them is a must. I followed the same and incorporated their advice. Including necessary keywords in your resume, highlighting points of importance such as numbers, ranks and scores in your CV, etc are some of the points to be kept in mind.\n\nTests: Once the CV preparation window is closed, different companies start taking their tests. I primarily sat for the tests of companies which were offering SDE or Quant roles and sometimes, for analytics roles. The tests were all conducted online on different platforms like HireVue, HackerRank, Codility,etc. Since the process is hectic with multiple tests being conducted every day (even at strange hours), I would suggest to only apply and appear for those tests in which one is ardently interested. Although mostly the tests for SDE roles consist of 2\u20133 Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) questions to be solved in 1\u20131.5 hours, some tests also have MCQ questions from core CSE topics such as DBMS, OOPS and OS. Quant Tests include problems from probability, aptitude and puzzles as well. Keeping in mind the time constraint, a thorough practice of all these topics is suggested.\n\nThere are tests that have certain behavioral questions which are subjective in nature. Since they can be similar to what is often asked in interviews, it is a good practice to keep them ready well before the tests.\n\nAs far as the test for Honeywell is concerned, it was conducted on HackerRank, and it consisted of 3 DSA questions to be solved in 1 hour. While 1 question was from \u2018Graph\u2019, the remaining questions were of logic or sorting, mostly based on the CP pattern.\n\nInterviews: Once shortlisted, most of the companies take 2\u20133 rounds of interviews before final selection of the candidate. The first and foremost thing would be to prepare your introduction well; A mess-up on introduction would be the last thing one would want to do.\n\nThe next thing would be to prepare your CV well enough in depth, so that you are able to defend every possible question that the interviewer would ask. Once the introduction and CV discussion is over, the interviewer moves on to testing the coding skills. The coding questions are often based on topics like linked lists, trees, DP and graphs. Sometimes, they also include questions pertaining to searching and sorting algorithms. Practicing with mock interviews is a good way to go for overall preparation of the interview rounds.\n\nMy interview at Honeywell had 2 rounds, which were both conducted in online mode. The first was the technical round. The interviewer discussed my resume after a brief introduction of myself. I gave the interviewer an overview of all of my projects in a nutshell before being questioned in-depth about one of my development projects. Moving ahead, he asked me a few DSA questions, primarily about trees, including how to declare a tree data structure, how to traverse a tree, and the codes for the same. He continued by asking me for a puzzle. Towards the end of the interview, he asked questions about development concepts that mostly pertained to my projects. The second round which was the HR round was more of a behavioral question round. It included some of the most frequently asked questions \u201cWhy this company?\u201d and \u201cWhy interested in this role?\u201d among several others. Once he finished with the questions, he asked me if I had any queries. As I was ready for this, I asked him what changes I should make to myself and what advice he would want to give me. I also inquired about the projects I would be working on if I was chosen. After giving a thorough explanation, he concluded the interview. After around 30 minutes, I learned that I had been chosen.\n\n3) How to prepare for them?\n\nI had prior knowledge of C (which I learnt in the first-year course PDS) and C++ (which I continued after learning C). I had attempted some CodeChef contests and was acquainted with the contest environment. Once in my fourth semester, I began studying DSA topics, starting off with some fundamental mathematical ideas before progressively going on to data structures like linked lists, trees, and graphs. By the end of the fourth semester, my CGPA was 9.31. This gave me an edge in the shortlisting process as many companies prefer a high CGPA; Some even have a minimum CG criterion for appearing in the tests. My projects included two web-development (mainly front-end) projects, a Do-It-YourSelf course project and a Work-System-Design Lab project.\n\nMay mark the onset of the main preparation phase, during which I first devised a schedule and work plan for the topics to be covered. I practiced topic-specific questions on leetcode after going over the concepts for the topics I had not yet studied and after reviewing the ones I had previously gone through. The goal was to finish all of the topics by the end of July. For DSA concepts, I referred to a YouTube playlist and the DSA course by GFG. Depending on the amount of content, I intended to give each topic a specific length of time and made an effort to finish each one by the due date. I tried to practice 9 to 10 questions on Leetcode every day. However, it was a demanding task, and I occasionally faltered.\n\nContests on platforms like CodeChef, CodeForces, and others assist one become accustomed with the testing environment. This enables them to manage the time pressure and do well on the actual test. I participated in a relatively small number of contests. I\u2019d advise taking this seriously and upsolving the questions after the competitions. In addition to this, one must prepare for some fundamental CSE topics, such as OOPS, Operating systems, etc, which I did around the middle of July. GFG can be used as a resource for puzzles. There are a number of online publications, books as well as sites that one can use to practice probability and statistics, and aptitude problems.\n\n4) What difficulties did you face while preparing for this Company/Profile? How did you overcome this problem\n\nThe first and foremost issue was a lack of appropriate guidance. Since we spent our first four semesters in an online mode, it wasn\u2019t until our fourth semester that I learned about the apt requirements and reading materials needed for the CDC process. I faced the toughest obstacle in the form of consistency while preparing in the months of May-July. Setting unrealistic goals will cause one to stray from their plan of action, which I would strongly advise against. I sometimes strayed from my objective and had to make up the missed ground in the days that were left. In the end, you must push yourself to achieve the goal you have set. During the process, you might want to give up at certain times. Thus, being in a supportive environment where your parents, friends, seniors and loved ones provide you with constant encouragement is therefore essential.\n\n5) According to you, who should ideally apply for this job?\n\nA person who enjoys working with software, develops technologies that can be applied to a variety of jobs, and has a captivating enthusiasm for finding solutions to complex real-world challenges is just the right candidate for this job. On a broader perspective, the ideal candidate for this position is someone who is eager to progress both vertically and horizontally inside an organization, that is, to sustainably return to the organization by advancing its most recent technological or commercial advancements. Some of the attributes one must have to be fervently engaged in this job include developing and contributing to something that makes a significant difference in the world of technology and inspiring others to engage in engineering with a humanitarian attitude.\n\n6) Any specific advice you want to give to the junta sitting for internships this year.\n\nDuring the process, you might experience frustration and feel impatient quite a few times. It\u2019s possible that less deserving individuals receive offers prior to you. You can find yourself being shortlisted yet struggling in numerous interviews. It thus becomes imperative to stay in contact with seniors, friends and family who would provide you with constant support and motivation throughout this journey. Having said that, nothing can replace a sincere attempt. So, try to make the most of your preparation window. Failures are an inevitable aspect of life, and we have all faced them. What sets us apart from others is how we view failure. So even if the progress is gradual, we must strive to elevate ourselves every day. Prepare well, practice questions and give mock interviews. Best of luck to all.\n\n7) Kindly attach your resume. What are some of the major points you think would be valid to mention in your CV while targeting this profile? (any specific suggestions you would like to make?)\n\nIt is ideal to have a decent cg of 8 or greater. Highlight all of your accomplishments and contributions to the various events or competitions. Make advantage of statistics to highlight your accomplishments, such as rankings, scores, etc. A few development projects (web or app) would strengthen your resume. It might be beneficial to take courses offered by the mathematics and computer science departments."

        "content": "FORESIGHT(2023): Summer Internship at Jaguar Land Rover| Daksh Varshney|\n\n--\n\nListen\n\nHi! My name is Daksh Varshney. I am a third-year undergraduate student of the Department of Electronics and Electrical Communication Engineering. I was born and brought up in Noida, Uttar Pradesh. Last year, I received an internship offer in the Software Profile from Jaguar Land Rover via the CDC internship drive.\n\n2. How did you get into JLR? What was the selection procedure?\n\nThere were two rounds in the selection procedure: an online assessment and a technical interview.\n\nOnline Assessment: It consisted of two sections, one for coding and the other for aptitude questions. The coding section had 3 DSA questions based on DP, Graphs, and Strings. The questions were of moderate difficulty. The aptitude section consisted of questions based on probability and statistics, linear algebra, and other puzzle-based questions. Students from all the departments were allowed to take the coding test.\n\nTechnical Interview: The interview round was for about 1 hour. It started with some coding questions on topics like linked lists and graphs. All the questions were of moderate difficulty. After this, they started CV grilling in which they asked questions about my past internships and projects. They mainly focused on my contribution to these projects. Finally, some standard HR questions were asked.\n\n3. How to prepare for them?\n\nYou must be proficient in DSA. There are multiple resources for preparing it like Interviewbit, GeeksForGeeks, Leetcode, and CSES. Keep giving contests on platforms like Codeforces and Codechef to practice solving questions in a time-bound environment. Also, keep a good habit of calculating time complexity and space complexity while solving a problem.\n\nFor preparing the aptitude section, brush up on basic concepts of probability and statistics, and linear algebra, apart from this practice problems from Brainstellar and Heard on the Street book.\n\nFor the interview round, be ready to live code in front of the recruiter. So you need to be able to explain whatever you are coding. Also, be prepared for CV grilling. You should be familiar with the STAR (situation, task, action, and result) method to prepare for the behavioral questions.\n\n4. What difficulties did you face while preparing for this Company/Profile? How did you overcome this problem?\n\nThe major difficulty that I faced was not being able to properly explain the approach of my solution in the interview rounds. To overcome this, I took some help from seniors and friends and they took some mock interviews which eventually helped me to improve. I also used to watch technical interviews on YouTube which helped me a lot.\n\n5. According to you, who should ideally apply for this job?\n\nAnyone interested in Software roles should apply for this job. Anyone can apply because your department won\u2019t be a barrier.\n\n6. Any specific advice you want to give to the junta sitting for internships this year?\n\nThe entire procedure is highly demanding, so psychologically get ready for it and stay motivated. Make a group of friends that are targeting the same profile as you and prepare with them. Working together to prepare will keep you motivated and guarantee that you don\u2019t miss any crucial deadlines. Practice mock interviews with your friends or seniors.\n\nMake sure your CV is well-prepared and that your seniors have reviewed it. Never be afraid of asking your seniors for doubts. They will be more than happy to help you.\n\nFinally, acknowledge that rejection is a necessary component of the entire process. Therefore, keep working hard, trust the process, and never give up hope if you receive any rejections. Eventually, you will succeed. Best of Luck :)\n\n7. What are some of the major points you think would be valid to mention in your CV while targeting this profile? (any specific suggestions you would like to make?)\n\nIf you have any, try to highlight at least one project or internship, as these demonstrate that you have real-world experience and the ability to work with others to solve any challenge. You can mention your ranks in coding competitions (such as KickStart, Codejam, and HackerCup) and on websites like Codeforces and CodeChef in your resume. Above all, only include something on your resume that you can support or are sure of.\n\nAll the best junta!!"

The projects highlighted in your CV should be diverse, i.e., if one project is about Web Dev, the other one can be a C++ app highlighting a particular algorithm\u2019s use case.\n\nIf you are a dual degree student, you can do summer research internships in the 2nd and 3rd years, allowing you to have some projects and internships to show on your resume.\n\nThere are too many topics to cover and too many concepts to get a good grasp on the field of Software Development. Most companies, however, test your basic concepts related to algorithms, data structures, and OOP, allowing them to get an idea of how fast you will be capable of learning something new. If you are proficient in Data Structures, Algorithms, and Math, you can master any new topic in days in this constantly evolving world of software. Hence, it is recommended to sharpen your algorithm skills as much as possible over learning topics with no deep knowledge.\n\nThe DSA part is something that requires much time and attention. The best way to prepare is to solve problems as much as possible. You can study DSA by referring to different sites such as GFG, Tutorialspoint, etc. If less time is left for CDC, you can take a course on AlgoZenith which can help you in preparing for DSA.\n\nSolving standard problems helps a lot. While companies ask for new problems, most problems in their problem set are standard ones. Hence, it is suggested not to leave them. Solve as many standard problems as you can. Standard problems can easily be found on leetcode, interview bit, and similar platforms. Nowadays, we also have many sheets of standard questions available free on the internet, and solving them would also be useful. Try to become acquainted with all of the classic problems from greedy, dynamic programming (DP), and graphs. Don\u2019t go towards solving competitive-type problems from sites like Codeforces and CodeChef before you are well versed with the common problems. And even if you prefer these competitive sites, there are sections for DSA learning there that should be preferred over problems from contests.\n\nYou can give contests regularly on Codeforces, Google Challenges, and CodeChef for speed, fast and accurate implementation and can do Interviewbit, CSES, and Leetcode for different types of problems. binarysearch.com is also a platform where you can do problems. It has an amazing room feature where you can compete with your friends in a time restraint. During this time you can also participate in Google Kickstart which will help you in getting good practice and identifying topics that have been missed.\n\nFor 2 months, focus primarily on DSA. You can solve questions from Codeforces(1600\u20132000 rated) by filtering various topics. 1 month before CDC you can start doing OOPs, OS, Network, ML/DL, basic probability and statistics, and puzzles. For puzzles, the best sources are the book \u2018Heard on the Street and the website \u2018Brainstellar\u2019. For probability and statistics, any resource which can teach you the required concepts will do. Do not just understand the theory, solve some problems to make sure you have understood the concepts. Whichever domain you apply to, you should not only read things but try writing/coding them yourself. By only reading, you might think that you have memorized and understood, but in the long run, things might fade out.\n\nIt is often asked how much time we should give to a question if we are unable to solve it. It mostly depends on you, but in the beginning, try providing enough time (at least 15/20 mins) so that you feel whatever I have learned I have given a thought on it and by seeing the answer you should not feel that I could have done that if I had been given more time.\n\nCS Core concepts like DBMS, Compilers, OS, Networks, etc., are also recommended if you are aiming for Day 1 or Day 2 companies. If you have a rough idea about them you can keep these for the end and prepare them in the last two weeks before the interviews. You can just read short notes from GFG if that is sufficient for you.\n\nWhat difficulties did you all face while preparing for this Company/Profile? How did you overcome this problem?\n\nWho should ideally apply for this profile?\n\nThis profile is recommended for anyone who is:\n\nThe SDE profile in Sprinklr has four roles: Front-end, Back-end, Machine Learning (ML) and Data Science. Mention the role of preference in your resume.\n\nWhat are some of the major points you think would be valid to mention in your CV while targeting this profile? (any specific suggestions you would like to make?)\n\nThe target is to make your CV distinctive, which allows you to stand out. Showcase your strengths in the CV. Any skill which is relevant to the profile can be considered a skill as long as you can back it up. Mentioning courses taken in Computer Science core might favour you as well. Showcase your competitive programming ranks, if any. Since the interviewers judge you on your problem-solving skills, your ranks will be a good testament to your ability. Global ranks in competitions like Google Code Jam, Google Kick Start, and Facebook Hacker Cup can also boost your chances.\n\nProjects and internships indicate hands-on experience, which interviewers generally take on a good note. Projects can be anything from self-projects or course projects. While more projects are always appreciated, unique projects allow the spotlight to fall on you. Any experience in ML/Artificial Intelligence, Data Science, Database and Networking systems, usage of git, etc. can increase the interviewer\u2019s preference of you over your peers.\n\nWhile making a CV, fill full pages rather than half pages. More importantly, be honest in what you represent in your CV. Be ready to be grilled upon anything you write on the CV.\n\nAny specific advice you want to give to the junta sitting for internships this year.\n\nThe journey will be challenging, fun, and sometimes stressful and hectic. As the competition and content increase yearly, it is advised not to target all profiles blindly. Rather, it is optimal to target one or two profiles and keep your preparation strong for those. Start preparing a bit early on. Create some good projects which are worth looking at.\n\nIn the last month, try not to waste your time and strengthen your basics. Since pre-final year students are not expected to know much, you will be evaluated on problem-solving skills. Try improving it as much as possible. OOP basics are important, as typical Algo/DS concepts can\u2019t be understood without completing a good project. Get used to sitting for long hours and brainstorming over a problem. Solve enough problems such that your codes are accepted in the first go. Give competitions from multiple sources like CodeChef, CodeForces, AtCoder, etc. It will provide you with different types of questions to learn from.\n\nThere are different coding problem patterns from different companies. Learn at least 2 languages (preferably C++ and Python). Try mock tests in HackerEarth and Hackerrank, since they are most companies\u2019 go-to sites when it comes to their tests. Be confident and try to do it in one go as wrong answers will make you panic. Attempt all questions, since partial marking is provided based on the number of test cases satisfied. Write clean and readable codes. Use meaningful variable names.\n\nPre-interview nervousness is normal. Check some interview behaviours, quizzes, puzzles, etc. During your interviews, try to focus and answer as you do during your preparation. Be sure to ask the interviewer some doubts if you are unclear on something. Use the brute force approach when you are not sure about the optimal approach. If you are sure about both of them, ask the interviewer for their preference of approach and proceed with it. Be confident and answer it in-depth, explaining all the paths taken and the infeasible paths.\n\nInterviews can be tiring. Believe in yourself and try your best. Forget previously messed-up interviews and focus on the current one. Your grade, department, and luck can influence this process. Finally, remember that even if you don\u2019t get in, it\u2019s just an 8-week period (internship). It won\u2019t impact your career heavily."

I am a Final-year Dual degree student from the Computer Science and Engineering department. I am interning this summer at Intuit as a Software Development Intern.\n\n2) How did you get into Intuit? What was the selection procedure?\n\nThere were two coding rounds followed by 2 Interviews. The first coding round consists of 4 coding questions in the easy-medium range and everyone was allowed to take the test. As per my knowledge whoever solved all the coding questions in 40\u201350 minutes was allowed to take the second coding test. Also, a number of the wrong submissions were considered ( as claimed by some batchmates ). The second coding round consists of 2 medium-hard coding questions, a duration of 1 hour. One was on Prefix Array and one on Greedy with queries. Interviews varied from student to student, mine were predominantly based on medium DSA questions along with computer science fundamentals and HR questions in each round.\n\n3) How to prepare for them?\n\nI started CP in my fourth semester by giving Codeforces contests. My growth was normal till Nov 20. After that, I took Algozenith course which affected my learning curve in an amazing way. Till Feb 21 I dedicated myself to doing Algozenith materials, after that I started practicing from leetcode. Solving mostly Medium-Hard questions I would suggest. I used to give virtual leetcode contests as much as I can (daily 1 or 2). I also used to give contests from binarysearch \u2014 a similar platform like leetcode. Also in binarysearch I used to practice with my peers, a good way to compete as well as exchange ideas. As the preparation phase came to an end, I started giving mock interviews with my peers ( leetcode has a feature, you can try ).\n\n15 days before my coding rounds started I started Interviewbit and completed almost >90% of the questions. Simultaneously I was preparing for CS Fundamentals from my course slides and GateSmashers.\n\n4) What difficulties did you face while preparing for this Company/Profile? How did you overcome this problem?\n\nInitially, I was not confident with DP and Graphs. So, the standard way to make something comfortable is to solve a lot of problems. For graphs I used CSES and for DP I mostly solved > 80% of questions from Algozenith followed by solving > 50 DP problems from leetcode.\n\n5) According to you, who should ideally apply for this job?\n\nDevelopers in Intuit are really amazing and get exposure to awesome things. People who love to solve real-life problems through code and want to make an impact in the lives of other people and aspire for the best work-life balance should definitely go for Intuit.\n\n6) What are some of the major points you think would be valid to mention in your CV while targeting this profile? (any specific suggestions you would like to make?)\n\n7) Any specific advice you want to give to the junta sitting for internships this year.\n\nThe preparation phase will keep on becoming stressful as tests will start approaching. I would suggest keeping your connection with peers who are going through the same phase would definitely help you to overcome this.\n\nAlso, during the interview think aloud while solving. Interviewers like to see what is going on in your mind. While coding, maintain good coding practices like camelCase notation, giving proper variable names, spacing, etc.\n\nWishing you all the best for your upcoming internship drive."

        "content": "FORESIGHT(2022): Summer Internship at Oracle | Compilation\n\n--\n\nListen\n\n1) Introduction\n\nHello everyone!\n\nI am Shourya Sharma, a final year undergraduate student from the Department of Mechanical Engineering enrolled in its B.Tech course.\n\nHello, My Name is Nikhil Yadav. I am a Final year Undergraduate student in the Department of Mathematics at IIT Kharagpur, enrolled in its 5-year Integrated M.Sc course. I am currently living in Jodhpur, Rajasthan. I love playing badminton, reading philosophy novels, and watching sci-fi movies.\n\nMy name is Vamshidhar Reddy Dudyala. I am a final year undergraduate student from the CSE department enrolled in its DD course.\n\nWe all got an internship offer at Oracle as SDE interns.\n\n2) How did you all get into Oracle? What was the selection procedure?\n\nThe selection procedure was of 2 steps, as usual, a test and then interviews. Oracle came for 2 profiles Applications Developer and Server Technology and conducted a test to shortlist candidates.\n\nThe test had 4 parts.\n\n1. English \u2014 basic.\n\n2. Core CS subjects \u2014 OOPs, DBMS, OS, etc.\n\n3. DSA \u2014 AVL, RB tree, Radix sort, etc. {unconventional}\n\n4. Aptitude \u2014 standard.\n\nEach section had its time slot so you can\u2019t repurpose the time you save in 1&4 to 2&3. There were a lot of questions and you can\u2019t go back, so you have to judge if the current question is worth solving or not.\n\nThe second one was a typical coding interview. They asked for basic BST, Linked list, and a few other standard problems. After which they asked if I knew anything about OOPs, DBMS, Java, etc. To all of which I answered NO. The interviewers were nice and didn\u2019t press on. Instead, they started asking me for interesting logical puzzles.\n\nThen they conducted interviews for the shortlisted people which were of 2\u20133 rounds. Questions about prior internships and projects were also discussed.\n\n3) How to prepare for them?\n\nThe preparation is just like all other Software profile companies. Firstly, one has to be clear with all the concepts of Data Structures and Algorithms to get into a software developer role. The best platform to start DSA is Interviewbit. After solving Interviewbit fully, start practicing in Leetcode, write weekly contests, and take as many mock contests as possible because writing the whole code and debugging under a time limit is very important and Leetcode provides a platform for Mock Contests. Having a group of friends with whom you can practice coding like we used to start a mock contest with only hard questions if any of us solved the questions everyone else would be able to see it in between the contests, so it became very competitive. Once you get a good hold on the concepts of DSA and solve many questions you can move to Codeforces or Codechef and start solving questions from there. Apart from standard DSA prep, if you have spare time, try to learn OOPs and the basics of Java. Their test had questions on various fields like Core CS topics, Language, some Coding questions, and Aptitude test. If you want to learn core CS topics, you can try out the channels on Youtube.\n\nOverall the test was not very Competitive coding oriented like other Software companies instead was focused more on overall knowledge of CS and aptitude.\n\n4) Difficulties faced while preparing for the Company/Profile and how to overcome them.\n\nOne of the major problems in getting into a software developer role is competition. Even after solving all the questions, one might not get shortlisted. To overcome this problem, one has to give as many mock tests as possible so that one gets used to writing code within the timeframe. Having a good CGPA and a good resume with decent projects is always an added advantage in getting shortlisted but not necessary. Having great coding skills is the most important factor to get into the Software Developer role.\n\n5) Who should apply for this internship?\n\nIf you like solving logical problems, doing coding in general, or are interested in Software Development, then you can be a good fit for this profile. Also, there is job stability in this field compared to HFTs (High-Frequency Trading), so if you prefer this, then go for it.\n\n6) What are some of the major points you think would be valid to mention in your CV while targeting this profile? (any specific suggestions you would like to make?)\n\nFor software profiles in general, previous internships and projects and technical skills matter. This gives you an edge over other people as the interviewer gets something to talk about and you have an opportunity to make an impression. Adding ratings on different Programming websites and ranks in competitions like Kickstart and Codejam allow you to stand out. Positions of Responsibility (PORs) are not that important but look good if you have them.\n\nDo not write anything on your resume that you are not confident about. If you are mentioning any project/intern make sure you are very thorough with it. Even if you exaggerate anything, just make sure that you can defend it.\n\n7) Any specific advice you all want to give to the junta sitting for internships this year.\n\nPrepare for tests at least 3\u20134 months early and keep in touch with your friends to be on track. Solve standard questions from Leetcode and GFG. Go through previously asked questions of various companies. Try giving mock interviews in parallel, so that it gives you confidence and an edge over other folks. Keep your introduction ready and better if you learn it by heart. Also, talk to seniors about the hiring process of specific companies you are targeting. Try to learn about the latest products or launches by the company you are applying for.\n\nOn the interview day, remain calm and keep yourself hydrated throughout the day as it will be hectic. Your mental toughness counts more than your technical skills during CDC season. Handling rejections is an acquired skill. Bounce back fast."

        "content": "FORESIGHT(2022): Summer Internship at Google| Compilation\n\n--\n\nListen\n\n1)Brief Introduction\n\nHey, I am Balakrushna Dash, a pre-final undergraduate student of IIT KGP, pursuing my B-tech course in the department of ECE.\n\nHi, I am Sumit Kumar Yadav, a final year undergraduate student from the Department of Computer Science and Engineering enrolled in its integrated dual degree course.I got Internship offers from Google and Microsoft through the on-campus CDC drive last year(2021).\n\nWe are interning this summer at Google as Software Engineers.\n\n2) How did you get into Google? What was the selection procedure?\n\nThe selection process involved one coding round followed by 2 technical interview rounds.The coding test was conducted on the HackerEarth platform in which 2 questions were given to solve in 60 mins.\n\nIn a particular case, the 1st problem was based on DP+DSU and the other problem was on DP.\n\nInterview Round 1: (50 min) The interview started with an introduction. After this, the interviewer asked the interviewee for 1 grid problem in which he had to find the longest path considering some additional constraints. He started with a brute force solution and worked on improving it while discussing it with the interviewer and came up with a solution using greedy and DP with optimization. He explained his logic and then, jumped to implementation.\n\nAfter this, the interviewer told him to trace this longest path. At last, the interviewer asked how his algorithm changes if some values are repeated in the grid. He explained his logic, and the interviewer was happy with it.\n\nRound 2: (45 min) The interview started with an introduction. After this, the interviewer asked him about 1 coding problem related to calculating the Jaccard similarity. He explained his logic and implemented it using map STL and then he was asked to improve complexity using some mathematics, to which he came up with the solution and coded it also. At last,He was asked one follow-up question, which he solved using a binary search.\n\nBoth the interviewers were quite friendly and helpful.\n\n3) How to prepare for them?A thorough understanding of algorithms and data structures is required for software engineering-based profiles. Once the basics of DSA are clear, there are many sources to practice problem-solving. If you are a beginner, then refer to Leetcode and InterviewBit. Once you feel confident in standard DSA, you can participate in competitive programming contests on codeforces to boost your problem-solving ability.Apart from standard DSA prep, if you have extra time, try to learn OOPs and core CS Subjects, mainly Operating systems and Computer Networks.\n\nFor Google, much importance is given to the candidate\u2019s resume, especially past Kickstart/Codejam performances. So, make sure to participate in these contests.Also, they asked a lot of DP problems for that practice problem from the Leetcode hard DP section.\n\nFrom someone who had successfully qualified it, this was his journey of preparation:\n\nHe started his competitive programming at the end of his 4th semester by giving contests on codeforces. He regularly gave contests and practice problems on different topics for around 6 months on codeforces. This builds the base, then he started to practice problems topic-wise to take this to another level.\n\nFor the graph, he solved the problems given in the CSES problem set.\n\nFor the DP, he solved problems given in the Leetcode (medium+hard).Just one month before the coding round started, he started Interviewbit and solved most of the questions.\n\n4) What difficulties did you face while preparing for this Company/Profile? How did you overcome this problem?In the beginning, I only used to solve problems from codeforces, but around 2 months before the start of the internship coding test, I didn\u2019t feel very confident in the dynamic programming-related problems. So, to overcome this, I moved to leetcode and after solving around 50\u201360 DP hard problems, I gained confidence which ultimately helped me in the test and interviews.\n\n5) According to you, who should ideally apply for this job?People interested in Algorithms and Data Structure and who want to pursue a career in software development can apply. There is a lot of scope for learning new technologies and skills during the internship.\n\n6) What are some of the major points you think would be valid to mention in your CV while targeting this profile? (any specific suggestions you would like to make?)\n\nFocus on competitive programming( or solving questions from leetcode) instead of doing random projects just to write in your CV.\n\nOne project is sufficient, and if you are a CS student, you will be doing one project in a software engineering course in your 4th semester.\n\nSo, try to participate in as many programming contests(Kickstart, Codejam, ICPC, Codeforces, Codechef) as you can and write those ranks/ratings that will be really useful during shortlisting.\n\nIt\u2019s totally fine, if you are in your second year and you don\u2019t have enough points to write, in that case, you can write your school achievements.\n\nProject-under-Prof is not compulsory, you can add self-projects to your CV as well. Just remember one thing, whatever skills you are going to add to your CV, you are expected to be knowledgeable about them. Any tech-related work in any society or any kind of achievement in some hackathon/contest will have a positive impact.\n\nSelf-project ideas: just google search for some python project and pick whatever you feel can complete.\n\n7) Any specific advice you want to give to the junta sitting for internships this year.\n\nFor preparation:-Practice CP.Try to learn the basics of OOPs.Dev-related projects may help.POR(s) are not at all necessary.\n\nFor Interview:-The best advice would be to stay confident and believe in yourself.The interviewer mainly wants to judge how well you think and approach a problem.It is very important that while thinking about the problem\u2019s solution, you think out loud.Keep talking with the interviewer about your approach so that even if you go wrong, he can give you a hint to get you back on track."

What was the selection procedure?\n\nI got into AlphaGrep via the CDC Internship Program. IIT Kharagpur\u2019s placement cell (known as the CDC) organised the on-campus hiring for various companies.\n\nAlphaGrep had an online test consisting of two sections, coding and MCQ.\n\nThe coding section had three relatively easy questions and could be done easily in time.\n\nThe concepts required were simulation/implementation, binary indexed trees and greedy.\n\nThe MCQ section had 45 questions to answer in thirty minutes. Almost all the questions were based on C++ fundamentals, with some sprinkling of Object Oriented System Design based questions. Considering the evident time crunch, this was something one had to focus for to do well in.\n\nAlphaGrep shortlisted 8 students for its SDE profile. From what I observed, they seemed to be high CGPA students from the CS/MA departments.\n\nHow to prepare for them?\n\nTo get shortlisted, I recommend having a moderate grip over Data Structures and Algorithms (Codeforces 1600+ rating) combined with a sound knowledge of the C++ language.\n\nAlphaGrep\u2019s code base is primarily in C++ and hence they need employees who understand the language well.\n\nUnfortunately, at least for the internship drive, it seems that AlphaGrep prefers relatively higher CG students from MA/CS.\n\nTo crack the interview, I\u2019d recommend learning C++ class design. Having a good grip of Object Oriented Class Design in C++ along with a thorough understanding of C++\u2019s fundamentals should be enough to get you through. Knowledge of Operating Systems theory will be icing on the cake.\n\nWhat difficulties did you face while preparing for this Company/Profile? How did you overcome this problem?\n\nI wasn\u2019t so comfortable with C++ class design before AlphaGrep\u2019s interview, but I studied once I got the shortlist and tried to understand as much as I could. The fact that I knew a fair bit of C++ helped in learning about principles and good practices of class design more quicker.\n\nAccording to you, who should ideally apply for this job?\n\nI recommend anyone who\n\n1. Is interested in the High-Frequency Trading industry\n\n2. Wants to be around knowledgeable, passionate and smart people\n\n3. Is interested in C++ development and has a decent grip over data structures and algorithms\n\n4.

What was the selection procedure?\n\nSo, the selection process consisted of 1 online coding round, 2 technical interview rounds and 1 HR round.\n\nThe coding round consisted of 2 DSA questions, both of them being of medium level leetcode. There were 15 MCQs on topics spanning across networking, core computer topics like OS and all.\n\nThe 1st interview round was supposed to be 45 mins but in my case it got stretched to over 1 hour because of repeated connectivity issues. This interview consisted mostly of medium easy level DSA questions from topics like binary search and a very standard DP question. Also got asked a lot of questions on OS, computer networks, dbms etc.\n\nThe 2nd round lasted only 20 mins or so and It was a project discussion round. The interviewer asked me to describe one of my projects from start to finish and how it can be optimized, how it might be scaled and all.\n\nThe 3rd round has a HR round. It consisted of questions like where do I see myself 5 years down the line, name some Cisco products, why do u want to join Cisco. The round ended with a discussion about the stipend and my preference for work location.\n\nHow to prepare for them?\n\nBe thorough with all your DSA problem solving skills. Interview bit and Leetcode are possibly the best resources out there to prepare for coding rounds. Apart from coding it is essential to have an understanding of the core CS topics like DBMS, OS and networking(Cisco focuses on networking a lot, I don\u2019t think other companies focus a lot on this). This helped me to score some additional brownie points.Also I participated in CF and Atcoder contests regularly which certainly developed my problem solving skills, but I didn\u2019t focus a lot on those contests.\n\nWhat difficulties did you face while preparing for this Company/Profile? How did you overcome this problem?\n\nThe difficulty with preparing for a profile like SDE is not actually the lack of resources but it\u2019s quite the opposite, There are too many resources to make a beginner puzzled as to where to even start. The best solution will be to focus on just one particular resource and trust it blindly and unless you are able to solve a good chunk of the single resource you started with don\u2019t look to anything else as it will confuse you more. That\u2019s the strategy I followed and personally I would recommend leetcode and later on for revising, solve InterviewBit.\n\nAccording to you, who should ideally apply for this job?\n\nAnyone having good problem solving skills and the ability to grasp things quickly, as things change really fast in the software field and one would need to adapt and be flexible enough to adapt to these changes.\n\nWhat are some of the major points you think would be valid to mention in your CV while targeting this profile? (Any specific suggestions you would like to make?)\n\nHave good projects on our CV. Don\u2019t just keep hoping to get a project from a professor or some other place, just start working on some self projects if you are not getting positive replies.(Fun Fact :- All the projects on my CV were self projects) Don\u2019t just keep hoping to get a project from a professor or some other place, just start working on some self projects if you are not getting positive replies.\n\nAny specific advice you want to give to the junta sitting for internships this year.\n\nAlong with focusing on DSA , do put a heavy emphasis on core CS concepts. These are the topics almost nobody does and hence if you are prepared with these it will give you an advantage over others. DSA questions which get asked in interviews and tests are not crazy tough, the time one spends on solving tough questions on CP platforms could be used to study these topics."

        "content": "FORESIGHT(2022): Summer Internship at Microsoft | Compilation\n\n--\n\nListen\n\n1) Introduction\n\nHello everyone!\n\nI am Prabhu, a fourth-year undergraduate student at IIT Kharagpur pursuing Mathematics and Computing (5 yr. Integ MSc). I am a boarder at LBS hall in KGP and am from Chennai, Tamil Nadu.\n\nMy name is Aryaman Jain. I am a fourth-year undergraduate from the Department of Computer Science and Engineering. I am currently interning at Microsoft as an SDE.\n\nMy name is Sunanda Mandal. As of 2021 during the CDC internship drive, I completed my second year of B. Tech in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering.\n\nWe all got an internship offer at Microsoft as SDE interns.\n\n2) How did you all get into Microsoft? What was the selection procedure?\n\nMicrosoft was open to all students with a CG greater than 7.5 and no active backlogs. Microsoft\u2019s Screening Test was different from those of other companies. The test was conducted on Codility, which doesn\u2019t require turning on the camera. Only two questions were asked, and both of them were very easy. However, unlike other tests, we only see the results of sample test cases during the test. Around 45 students were shortlisted based on Submission time and System tests.\n\nThere were 3 rounds of interviews (2 technical and 1 Hr.).\n\nRound 1:\n\nThe first question of the round was a CP question immediately after the introduction. In total, two questions were asked in this round, one of them was a Leetcode Hard level question. After round 1, I was called for round 2 within five minutes\n\nRound 2:\n\nThis is, as far as I know, the round that determines your selection. This interview round lasted more than 1 hour and included questions about DSA, OOPS, OS and System design.\n\nRound 3:(Hr. round)\n\nI was asked about my plans after completing college. As I\u2019m from MnC, the interviewer was interested in the CS courses we study and questions were asked from the same. This round also consisted of a couple of CP(DSA) questions (again here is one direct Leetcode Hard problem)\n\nI was asked about my motivation behind choosing ML over my core subjects, my favorite mechanical engineering subject and the reason behind it.\n\nPS, the interview round was quite different for different candidates and it will highly depend on your CV. If your CV is not much aligned to ML, you can also expect questions from algorithms and data structures or software-related projects/courses if you have mentioned any in your CV.\n\n3) How to prepare for them?\n\nProjects that are mentioned in the CV should be prepared thoroughly. Do not write anything in the CV that you are not aware of.\n\nmaintaining a good CG and having a couple of software-related projects (self or supervised) are good to have\n\nSince you get to know the selection results a week before, I would advise the candidates to go through Microsoft careers page\u2019s tips and tricks to prepare accordingly.\n\nFor Online Assessment it was easy coding questions so anyone who solved a decent amount of questions were able to do it.\n\nFor Interviews, Practicing leetcode questions from every DSA topic will be enough. Pick Leetcode Hard Problems by randomizing (Pick one option in LC) the questions. This helped to cover a wide range of topics in less time and boosted the confidence as well.\n\nFor algorithms and data structures gave regular contests on codeforces and atcoder. For interviews and famous problems use interview bit and cses.fi.\n\nTo understand complex concepts in DSA, follow this.\n\nAnd before appearing for an interview in any Company/profile try to learn what they do and why you want to apply.\n\n4) Difficulties faced while preparing for the Company/Profile and how to overcome them The major difficulties faced are having low confidence even with good experience with interviews, feeling demotivated whenever they do not give their best and not being able to explain their own code because of nervousness. Practicing mock interviews regularly is the best way to solve this. Contacting the people who are preparing for the same position/ similar interview and discussing the problems that aren\u2019t solvable by ourselves will help overcome this.\n\n5) Who should apply for this internship?\n\nAnyone who is interested in Software profiles and has a good hold of DSA can apply. If you like to learn and work on the latest technologies and are interested in Software Development, you will like the work. They do not generally ask development related questions in the interviews. If\n\nIf you are comfortable with solving coding problems and have knowledge of core CS concepts you should definitely apply for this job.\n\n6) What are some of the major points you think would be valid to mention in your CV while targeting this profile? (any specific suggestions you would like to make?)\n\nFor Software Intern role software development projects are more valuable than ML projects. Nicely highlight all your achievements in the Academic Achievements sections. Put your handle ratings from websites like codeforces and codechef. Mention the rank if you\n\nparticipated in google codejam, Kickstart or Facebook hackercup. Put open source contributions if any.\n\nFinally do not focus on the number games of Day 1,2 etc.\n\n7) Any specific advice you all want to give to the junta sitting for internships this year."

I\u2019m pursuing a B.Tech. in Electronics and Electrical Communication Engineering and a minor in Computer Science and Engineering. During the CDC internship recruitment drive, I received an offer from Salesforce for their SWE intern role.\n\nI was shortlisted for 3 companies on day 1 (Tower Research, GS, Sprinklr) wherein I couldn\u2019t grab an offer after several rounds in these companies. On day 2, I was shortlisted for 4 companies, namely, Salesforce, Oracle, TI Embedded Software, and Honeywell. Salesforce was the first company I was interviewed for on the day and I received an offer from them soon after.\n\nHow did you get into Salesforce? What was the selection procedure?\n\nSalesforce is open to CS, EE, EC, IM, MA branches\n\nOnline Coding Test \u2014 1\n\n3 questions\n\n1st \u2014 Easy \u2014 Question based on STL implementation\n\n2nd \u2014 Medium \u2014 Min. time to get all jobs done under some constraints (Binary search)\n\n3rd \u2014 Medium \u2014 Question on graph (DFS)\n\nInterview rounds \u2014 2\n\nFirst-round (Technical) \u2014 Few medium to hard level coding questions (similar to that in Leetcode), Discussion on some specific concepts of OOPs, and Puzzles (might be asked).\n\nHR round \u2014 Behavioural questions, a brief discussion on the CV\n\nHow to prepare for them?\n\nTest preparation \u2014 Complete InterviewBit during summers. Practice medium and hard difficulty level questions from leetcode.\n\nInterview preparation \u2014 Conventional code writing skills on paper/online editor, being very precise about standard algorithms, OOPs concepts, and being well versed with the projects/internships written in your CV is a must. Computer science fundamentals could be particularly vital for dual degree students. \u2018Heard on the Street\u2019 and \u2018Fifty Challenging Problems in Probability\u2019 are good resources for puzzles.\n\nGeneral advice \u2014 Prior to interviews, check the Salesforce Core Values. Even though they won\u2019t ask for it explicitly, a little knowledge about their values and culture might prove beneficial for you.\n\nWhat difficulties did you face while preparing for this Company/Profile? How did you overcome this problem?\n\nFinding the appropriate information to learn and practise with was the major challenge I encountered during my preparation for the software profile. There are a lot of resources on the internet for every single topic. For me, group preparation was the answer to this issue. Deciding upon which material to study and what all questions to practise is much easier in a group. Additionally, everyone keeps their motivation up the entire way.\n\nAccording to you, who should ideally apply for this job?\n\nAnyone who is really interested in working as a software developer in a top product-based company must apply for this job. If you appreciate a good work culture, then this is your destination. They have one of the best work cultures in the world.\n\nWhat are some of the major points you think would be valid to mention in your CV while targeting this profile?

        "content": "FORESIGHT(2022): Summer Internship at Honeywell | Compilation\n\n--\n\nListen\n\n1) Brief Introduction\n\nI am Abhishek S. Purohit, a final year undergraduate student in the Department of Chemical Engineering.\n\nI am Ashutosh Patkar from the Department of Ocean Engineering\n\nI am Prathmesh, a final year UG student from the QEDM branch, Department of Industrial and Systems Engineering.\n\nI am Mudit Gupta, a final year student in the department of chemistry.\n\nHi, I am Raushan Sharma, a final year undergraduate in the Department of Mathematics, IIT Kharagpur, enrolled in its 5-year Integrated M.Sc. course of Mathematics and Computing. Having a keen interest in mathematics, I love problem-solving and wish to apply my mathematical skills into solving practical problems and pain points.\n\nMy name is Rahul Kumawat, a third-year undergraduate student of the Department of Chemical Engineering enrolled in its B.Tech Course. I am from Jhunjhunu, Rajasthan.\n\nWe all got an internship offer from Honeywell for the SDE role through the on-campus CDC drive last year.\n\n2) How did you get into Honeywell? What was the selection procedure?\n\nFirst, we have to apply via ERP. It opens for every department and the CGPA criteria are >7.5.\n\nIt generally starts with an online coding test. It consists of 2 programming questions with a time limit of 1 hour. The test is conducted on the Hackerrank platform. Problems were related to Dynamic Programming, Graphs, Catalan numbers, etc. Someone who has decent practice from InterviewBit or Leetcode will find the problems familiar.\n\nLater, based on your score on the test and your CV, shortlisted people are allotted some panels for interviews. There are two rounds of interviews one -the technical round and the second one -the HR round.\n\nTECHNICAL ROUND \u2014 The Technical round very much depends on the interviewer. Some of them mostly ask questions like \u2014 What all graph traversal algorithms do we know, then explain how they work. What all Data structures we have studied and their properties Also , they ask about the time complexity of the radix sorting algorithm and discuss the projects done by that particular individual. Basic questions on OS, DBMS and some average questions on CP can be asked. Apart from these questions from your CV can be surely asked. Good projects on your CV would help you in driving interviews in your preferred direction. They give the interviewer some topics to discuss and assess you. Also having an in-depth understanding of the project and the ability to speak with confidence to convince the interviewer is an added advantage.\n\nHR ROUND \u2014 The HR round is generally a short one. Non-technical questions from CV are asked and some typical HR questions like your past experiences and what difference can you make if you were selected for this role. HR would be mostly interested in co-curricular activities, your ability to speak out your thoughts and most importantly whether you resonate with the company values or not. For the HR round, it is highly advisable going through the company\u2019s page and check out the current working domain of the company, as HR would expect you to have some knowledge of the company to which you are applying. Also check out company values.\n\n3) How to prepare for them?\n\nAns: Firstly, basic programming is a must for any software profile in any company. There will be easy to medium questions from them in the test. Clear all the concepts of standard data structures and algorithms and focus more on Dynamic programming as this topic is asked almost in every company\u2019s test. Study about OOPS concept, and its different components and also practice live coding.\n\nAs far as coding tests are concerned, you should practice CP at least for around 2 months to get a good grip on it. You could refer to platforms like leetcode, CodeChef & GFG for practicing questions because questions will be very similar from these platforms. You could also refer to the Algozenith course and the 10xIITian platform to learn about CP concepts.\n\nFor technical interviews, prepare your CV very well, everything from your CV should be at your fingertips and practice quality problems on leetcode or interviewbit. Stay confident while answering and don\u2019t panic during the interview. Never code in an interview like you know everything about the problem, try to interact with the interviewer, ask doubts and if no doubt then tell him what you are doing to solve the problem and why you are doing it then only the interviewer will take interest in you, ask for hints if you are stuck anywhere, the interviewer is there to help you, he/she just wants to check your thought process.\n\nFor interviews, one may follow the book \u201cCracking the Coding Interview\u201d, and go through Interview experiences from GFG.\n\nSome material for DP from our side \u2013\n\n1. https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_z_8CaSLPWekqhdCPmFohncHwz8TY2Go\n\n(To learn DP from Basics)\n\n2. https://atcoder.jp/contests/dp\n\nFor the HR round, prepare some standard HR questions (which can easily be found on google) and in the interview be active and listen carefully to HR. Go through the company\u2019s profile, its main working domains, its culture and values.\n\n4) What difficulties did you face while preparing for this Company/Profile? How did you overcome this problem?\n\nCompetition is one of the most difficult aspects of becoming a software developer. To address this challenge, one must perform as many mock tests as possible. Having a good CGPA and a resume with relevant projects is always a plus, but it is not required. The most significant requirement in becoming a Software Developer is having excellent coding skills.\n\nCoding Interviews are very different from competitive programming. In interviews, you need to slowly build-up to the efficient solution without knowing the constraints. But in a competitive programming contest, the entire approach and mindset are dependent on the constraints. Being a CP guy can mess up the interviews a bit. Not directly looking at the constraints sometimes should be good enough to overcome this problem.\n\nWhen solving problems do not get stuck on a question if you are low on time.\n\nJust move on with the next question and later visit the unsolved question again.\n\nIf you were involved in ML from start, you would have a bit more orientation towards Python over C++. It is highly recommended to master one language for CP purposes and C++ is highly preferred for that.\n\nHowever, for CDC if one feels he/she has less time for preparation of this profile, and it\u2019s somewhat late to start CP, then start with InterviewBit.\n\nWhile preparing for CDC, you have to face rejections either in interviews or in coding tests. So you have to be mentally strong and believe in yourself during this period.\n\n5) According to you, who should ideally apply for this job?\n\nThose who are interested in building softwares, coding or handling big data, in general, can apply for this role. Honeywell offers a varied range of tech stacks and projects for interns from DevOps, Machine Learning, Webapps, MicroServices, Databases, etc. You may get a chance to work on these cutting technologies. Anyone interested in these can apply. Honeywell did not have any department or CG criteria in 2021. If data structures and algorithms are something that interests you, and you like problem-solving, you are good to go and apply for this job profile.\n\nAlso, the work-life balance is very good generally but in some teams, it can get a little bad.\n\n6) What are some of the major points you think would be valid to mention in your CV while targeting this profile? (any specific suggestions you would like to make?)\n\nCV is a very major aspect of every interview. It is better if you have content in your CV resonating with the role you are applying for.\n\nIf you have done a software or ML-related internship(s) or project(s), then you can mention that in the CV, it would definitely be a good topic to discuss in the interview. Apart from that, you can also mention your codeforces/codechef ratings, any good rank in codeforces/codechef/kickstart/hackercup round.\n\nApart from that you could also mention the relevant software-related course(s) if you have taken any from KGP or from MOOCs. Just be ready to answer questions on the tech stack mentioned in your CV.\n\n7) Any specific advice you want to give to the junta sitting for internships this year.\n\nTry to revise the required topics and concepts in a day before the interview. To get an idea about the interview give some mock interviews if you can or at least watch some mock interviews on YouTube and visit interview preparation sites like leetcode etc. and consistently solve the problems in a time-bound manner. If possible, solve and practice codes with your group of friends who have the same passion. In this way, you can learn many new concepts.\n\nPrepare your CV very well, and write only those things which you can defend. Stay confident and don\u2019t get stressed out. Ask twice if you don\u2019t understand the question. Always remember, it\u2019s not the right answer that matters, it\u2019s the approach that matters. The coding tests are hectic so try to get proper rest during break time. Maintain your enthusiasm on the day of the interview and don\u2019t get disheartened seeing your friends getting intern on Day 1 or Day 2, your time will surely come. All the best!"

        "content": "FORESIGHT(2022): Summer Internship at Disney+Hotstar| Dibyendu Biswas\n\n--\n\nListen\n\nIntroduction\n\nMy name is Dibyendu Biswas. I am a 3rd-year undergraduate student of the Department of Electronics and Electrical Communication engineering enrolled in its B.Tech course. I am a boarder of Pt. Madan Mohan Malvia hall of residence. I am from Kolkata, West Bengal.\n\nHow did you get into Hotstar? What was the selection procedure?\n\nI got an offer from Disney+Hotstar on Day 3 of the CDC Internship drive.\n\nSelection Process:\n\n1. Tests: As far as I remember there were 2\u20133 DSA questions, and some MCQs. 2. Interviews:\n\nThere were a total of 3 rounds including the HR round.\n\n1st Round: It was pretty simple, they asked to implement the data structure SETS using the concepts of OOPS in any language you want, there were some additional constraints to it like it can also store special characters, I don\u2019t remember them clearly but it was not that difficult. Then the interviewer asked some basic questions on OOPS and some questions on my projects like\u2026..Explain MVT structure in Django.\n\n2nd Round: It was a DSA round, the problem statement was something like this: Q1. You have K sorted linked list of size N, sort them into one linked list.\n\nSo I started with the basic approach with Time Complexity (K*N). Then optimized it to K*log(N) in the final approach, using PRIORITY QUEUE.\n\nQuestion 2 was much easier\n\nQ2. Write a program to calculate pow(x,n) in Time Complexity O(log(n)).\n\n3rd Round (HR Round): If you reach till HR Round, then Congratulations you have cracked the interviews and will get the offer from Hotstar :)\n\n3) How to prepare for them?\n\nPractice CP as much as you can from platforms like Codeforces, Codechef. And in the last 2 months complete Interviewbit. And prepare OOPS from gfg before going for the interview. You may also cover OS, Networking and DBMS. Some companies ask MCQs related to these topics in tests and even in interviews.\n\n4) What difficulties did you face while preparing for this Company/Profile? How did you overcome this problem?\n\n\u25cf The whole CDC process gets very hectic, because companies take tests throughout the day, from Morning 6 am to even at night 12pm \u2014 2am ( only leaving the Class hours) for a whole week, so eventually people skip classes to get some rest.\n\n\u25cf Then Interviews generally are conducted on the weekend. And again the process gets very hectic, you have to wait a long time for your chance. If you have multiple interviews on a day, you might also have to skip some interviews to give the others.\n\n\u25cf Then one thing that happened with me was, I was waiting for my turn for 1\u20132 hours (knowing they would take my interview). But then the CDC coordinator informed me at the end that I was in the waiting list of the company and the company already hired enough interns, so all the waiting list guys were rejected. So I got really disappointed at that point of time.\n\nMy suggestion would be that you stay put, don\u2019t give up and keep trying. Eventually after multiple rejections and struggles, you\u2019ll surely get an intern.\n\n5) According to you, who should ideally apply for this job?\n\nGuys looking for an opportunity in Software Development or an entry-level opportunity with good compensation can apply.\n\nPeople from almost all the departments can apply.\n\n6) Any specific advice you want to give to the junta sitting for internships this year. I would like to write some general DOs and DON\u2019Ts for CDC.\n\nDO\u2019s :\n\n\u25cf Be Honest, and Don\u2019t lie. Don\u2019t write something in your CV that when asked you are not able to explain it.\n\n\u25cf You must have 1 good development project or intern on your CV, and must have basic knowledge of the frameworks and libraries used in the project.\n\n\u25cf Dress to impress. Even if the company is casual, you should dress nicely in Formals.\n\nDON\u2019Ts:\n\n\u25cf Don\u2019t be quiet throughout your interview, keep talking to the interviewer, keep interacting with him/her. Even if you don\u2019t know the perfect answer to a question, keep engaging with the interviewer, they are there to help you out, give you hints and lastly they also want to see your communication skills during your interview.\n\n\u25cf Don\u2019t sleep late at night before your interview, generally the interviews start from 7 am in the morning. So make sure to have a good night\u2019s sleep.\n\n\u25cf Don\u2019t offend or cross-question the interviewer in any way.\n\n7) What are some of the major points you think would be valid to mention in your CV while targeting this profile? (any specific suggestions you would like to make?) \u25cf Firstly Hotstar was open to almost all the departments, and people from different deps were shortlisted for the interview, so you don\u2019t have to worry about not being from a circuital dep.\n\n\u25cf A good CG will be a plus point, mostly above 8\u20138.5 would be enough.\n\n\u25cf Then you must have 1 good development project or intern on your CV, and must have basic knowledge of the frameworks and libraries used in the project.\n\n\u25cf You can add your rankings of various coding contests like Kickstart, Codeforces, Codechef, etc."

Shaw this summer for a period of two months.\n\nHow did you get into DE Shaw? What was the selection procedure?\n\nI applied through the official CDC portal and after cv shortlisting there were two phases, Online coding round on Hackerrank and then interviews on Day1. The coding round had 3 questions on DSA and solving two were sufficient to move on. There were two interviews, one based on DSA and other on OOPS, SQL, ProbStat, DSA. Do note that SQL and ProbStat are questioned only after asking the student if they know it.\n\nHow to prepare for them?\n\nSolving Interviewbit/leetcode might not be sufficient for online coding rounds and consistent practice on other platforms like codeforces is recommended.

I also used to watch technical interviews on YouTube during lunch and dinner which helped in removing my fear of interviews. My Best Friend would also take my mock interviews through google meet where he would ask me approaches for solving coding questions and would also give some important pointers. I also had a senior (who was previously an intern at AMAZON and successfully got the PPO) who provided me some valuable tips for acing the interview.\n\nAs a result, my Interview was a success.\n\nI owe my family, seniors and best friends a great debt of thanks for their support and encouragement.\n\nAccording to you, who should ideally apply for this job?\n\nAnyone who is interested in Software roles should apply for this job. Your department would not act as a barrier therefore anyone can apply.\n\nAny specific advice you want to give to the junta sitting for internships this year.\n\nWhat are some of the major points you think would be valid to mention in your CV while targeting this profile?(any specific suggestions you would like to make?)\n\nALL THE BEST GUYS AND MACHAAKE AANA !!"

I am from Chandrapur, Maharashtra. I will be joining Sprinklr as a Product Engineer at the Gurgaon office.\n\nHow did you get into Sprinklr? What was the selection procedure?\n\nI was selected in Sprinklr through the CDC placement process in the academic year 2021\u201322, Sprinklr was open for all the departments this year.\n\nThe first round was an online coding test. No CGPA cut-off was there, hence everyone who applied in the ERP was eligible to write this test. Three coding problems \u2014 one easy and two medium-hard \u2014 were given to be solved within 90 minutes in Hackerearth platform.\n\nAround 60\u201365 students were shortlisted for the interviews.\n\nSprinklr takes 4 interview rounds in general (3 Technical + 1 Culture fit). All rounds were eliminatory and lasted around 45 minutes. The interviews were mostly based on data structures and algorithms, OOPS, OS and DBMS concepts. Some questions were asked on projects and internships from the CV which were of interest to them.\n\n4 students were selected finally.\n\nHow to prepare for them?\n\nOne needs to have good problem-solving skills and understanding of data structures and algorithms.\n\nTaking the Algorithms course offered by the CSE department is beneficial. Geeksforgeeks is also a good website to learn CS concepts. To practice coding, start solving problems on codeforces.com. Leetcode.com has standard problems which are also helpful for the same.\n\nGiving online contests on this website is also very important. It teaches you to write the entire code, debug and consider the corner-cases too within the timeframe. Practice a lot. Solving all the questions quickly becomes important in placement coding tests because the competition is high.\n\nMake sure you give mock interviews before sitting for actual interviews in placements.\n\nWhat difficulties did you face while preparing for this Company/Profile? How did you overcome this problem?\n\nMost top companies look for students from the circuit department or the ones who are exceptionally good in coding. Therefore, to be a relevant candidate, I practiced a lot of programming from leetcode and codeforces. I also improved my CGPA, while learning some concepts such as DBMS and OS.\n\nAccording to you, who should ideally apply for this job?\n\nAll the technology enthusiasts and students who love coding should apply for this job.\n\nAny specific advice you want to give to the junta sitting for placements this year.\n\nStudy smart, practice a lot, prepare well. Getting selected in a particular company is not in your hands. A lot of external factors play a role in that. All you can do is work hard and improve yourself. Don\u2019t get demotivated as it will affect your preparation. Some days you will feel low, and it\u2019s completely okay. Take a small break and continue your preparation again. You will get good results. Believe in yourself. Make a study group if possible.\n\nGive mock interviews. Try to explain your code as much as possible. Spoon-feed everything to the interviewer; don\u2019t just assume that they will know about it since it\u2019s a basic thing. Communication skills are also important.\n\nWhat are some of the major points you think would be valid to mention while targeting this profile? (Any specific suggestions you would like to make?)\n\nMake your CV relevant to the profile you\u2019re applying for. Don\u2019t dilute your CV by adding extra non-related stuff. Also, write only those things which you are confident about."

        "content": "FORESIGHT(2022): Summer Internship at Goldman Sachs| Rishav Kumar\n\n--\n\n1\n\nListen\n\nBrief Introduction\n\nHi Everyone ! I am Rishav Kumar, a third-year B.Tech student from the department of Electronics and Electrical Communication Engineering. I will be interning at Goldman Sachs as part of its Engineering Division in the summers of 2022.\n\nHow did you get into GS? What was the selection procedure?\n\nThe selection procedure consisted of an online round which was conducted on Hackerrank platform a few weeks before the interview. It consisted of 5 sections :\n\nSection 1 (Easy Programming Round)\n\nThere were two questions, both implementation based. Questions were easy but the time limit was 30 minutes. Unfortunately, I took too much time in the first question due to minor bugs and was able to solve only one of them.\n\nSection 2 (Quantitative Aptitude)\n\nThe questions in this section were tough (JEE level). The topics covered were Probability, Expectation Values, Trigonometry and logical reasoning. Since I didn\u2019t prepare for the quant profile specifically, I was able to answer only one or two questions from this section.\n\nSection 3 (CS Fundamentals)\n\nThis section consisted of theoretical questions from core CS subjects like Operating Systems, Computer Networks, Predicting output of a given code. I was able to solve around 30\u201340 % of the questions.\n\nSection 4 (Hard Programming Round)\n\nThere was only one question with a time limit of 45 minutes. The question was arguably one of the hardest questions asked in CDC that year. It was based on profile DP (DP + Bitmasking). It took me around 30 minutes to code the solution and 5 minutes to debug. As I had solved a similar question before, I knew straight away how the general structure of the solution would look like. I was able to pass all the test cases.\n\nSection 5 (Behavioral/HR essay-type question)\n\nThe questions were :\n\nWhat will you do if your teammate leaves you in the middle of the project due to some personal issues ?\n\nMention a situation where your passion and enthusiasm helped you in achieving the goal.\n\nTime limit was 15 minutes. The exact same questions were asked in previous year\u2019s round. I was prepared with a suitable answer for each of these questions.\n\nThere was another criterion for selection which was CGPA. Performing well in any one of the subsections (Coding / Quant) was enough to be called for an interview. Around 80 people were shortlisted for the interviews.\n\nRound 1\n\nThe round started off with a basic implementation question.The interviewer just wanted to see if I could convert my thoughts into code. He then asked me a puzzle. I was told that I could solve the problem either logically or by writing code. After a few minutes of brainstorming I wrote a recursive code and arrived at the final answer.\n\nRound 2\n\nI wasn\u2019t required to code in this round. The interviewer just asked me theoretical questions on various well-known algorithms like Dijkstra, Manhattan, CPU Scheduling, etc. I was also asked a bit about my projects.\n\nRound 3\n\nThe round consisted of a medium-hard level question. It was based on DP on a binary tree. It took me a while to code up the solution. Initially the interviewer wasn\u2019t able to understand my solution as I had optimized the space complexity to O(1) but after a few minutes of discussion he was satisfied. He then asked me about my project with a few follow-up questions.\n\nThere was no HR round. I received the confirmation about two hours later that I have been selected.\n\nHow to prepare for them?\n\nI initially came to know about Competitive Programming from some of my friends during the start of my 2nd semester. I started with beginner level problems on Codechef and Hackerrank. Soon I realized the importance of Data Structures and Algorithms in CP and decided to learn it thoroughly.\n\nInitially I followed the videos of mycodeschool youtube channel and then moved to cp-algorithms website. Meanwhile I kept solving questions and participated in as many contests as I could.\n\nAfter reaching the fourth semester I realized that my ratings were stable and I couldn\u2019t improve them even after upsolving the questions. It was at this time that I decided to join the AZ-201 course of AlgoZenith. The course covered everything from scratch. The questions on the platform were quite relevant from the CDC point of view. Meanwhile, I also took the Algorithms-I and Algorithms-I Lab courses as additionals. All these resources were enough to provide me with a firm grasp on DSA skills.\n\nIn the summer break before CDC I moved on to platforms like InterviewBit and LeetCode to prepare for interview rounds. I solved interviewBit completely and did around 150 most liked questions on LeetCode. I also worked on two small projects (one on NLP and the other on Blockchain) and implemented them from scratch.\n\nWhat difficulties did you face while preparing for this Company/Profile? How did you overcome this problem?\n\nOne of the biggest setbacks that I faced during my preparation was not being able to push my ratings above a certain limit (5-star on CodeChef and Expert on Codeforces). However I soon realized that the questions on these platforms were more towards the ad-hoc side rather than DSA. Consequently, I shifted to other platforms like LeetCode and focused more on improving my DSA skills rather than worrying about my ratings.\n\nAccording to you, who should ideally apply for this job?\n\nPeople who have a keen interest in the Software Development domain with a slight interest in Finance should ideally apply for this internship program.\n\nAny specific advice you want to give to the junta sitting for internships this year.\n\nPractice Competitive Programming. There\u2019s no shortcut to that at all. CP won\u2019t just help you in grabbing an internship/placement offer, but also helps to improve problem-solving skills, builds aptitude and spontaneous thinking.\n\nAsk questions to the interviewer. At times they make the question unclear purposefully hoping that you may ask for clarifications.\n\nThink out loud during the interview, so that the interviewer knows your thought process and may guide you towards the solution.\n\nDon\u2019t panic. Keep a smile on your face and a calm head.\n\nDon\u2019t worry too much about ratings, focus on learning.\n\nDon\u2019t get demotivated after seeing your friends get an offer in a Day1 company. Some of the companies that come later are equally good as Day1 companies.\n\nWhat are some of the major points you think would be valid to mention in your CV while targeting this profile?(any specific suggestions you would like to make?)\n\nHaving a project on your CV really gives you an edge over others. Not only does it help you to understand software development but also becomes a major point of discussion during your interviews. Having good ranks in coding competitions like Google Kickstart, Google CodeJam, ICPC also adds value to your resume.\n\nLastly, be thorough with your resume. Don\u2019t write anything on your CV which you won\u2019t be able to explain.\n\nRemember, it\u2019s okay not to get a good offer initially as you will get lots of opportunities in the future. Just try giving your best. Feel free to ping me on Facebook/LinkedIn for any questions :)\n\nAll the best."

        "content": "FORESIGHT(2022): Summer Internship at Sprinklr | Nuruddin Jiruwala\n\n--\n\nListen\n\nBrief Introduction\n\nHello junta! My name is Nuruddin Jiruwala, and I just completed my fourth year in Electrical Engineering in its dual degree course. I am interning as a Product Engineer Intern at Sprinklr in the ML team this summer of 2022, which I received via CDC internships 2021\u201322. Appreciate the initiative by SWG to share the experiences of people spread across various fields, helping our beloved KGP community.\n\nHow did you get into Sprinklr? What was the selection procedure?\n\nSo the procedure was divided into two stages broadly\n\nHow to prepare for them?\n\nIf you are a Dual Degree student then it\u2019s good to have multiple projects/at least one internship or both on your resume. As the DSA part goes I tried doing it my way in my first and second years but ended up getting nowhere. So I opted for Algozenith as it was more structured than my way was ever going to be.\n\nFor the ML concepts, do projects/internships. Trust me, you will learn more on the job than any Coursera course. Saying that I did do a few good courses. Other than that read about the algorithms, their logic, where they can be used, their pitfalls, and the mathematics behind them. There are numerous blogs on the internet regarding them. A bit of linear algebra is also necessary for the maths to make sense. As nobody is going to ask how you would import these models in python because even a kid can do that. They will ask about their inner workings which you will have no idea about if you haven\u2019t already read about them in detail. Statquest(a youtube channel) worked great for me to help me understand some of the statistics and the intuition behind many algorithms. Try to learn and practice at least one simple code on all the famous frameworks i.e. Keras, Tensorflow, Pytorch, etc.\n\nOther than that, have good communication skills and confidence as you need those to voice out your opinions to your team as well as your manager. And well, if you don\u2019t speak in interviews then what\u2019s the point of giving them? :P\n\nWhat difficulties did you face while preparing for this Company/Profile? How did you overcome this problem?\n\nI used to get overwhelmed by the sheer amount of material and stuff to be learned that was available on the internet. That used to break my motivation for days. But I figured I will do it at my pace and we\u2019ll see what happens. The thing that helped me most here is having a support group. I was lucky as I had my parents all the way as well as some great friends(who were also preparing for CDC so we were kinda going through it together). My advice here would be to practice and learn consistently, be it at a slow pace initially doesn\u2019t matter and have a few people to whom you can rant at 3 am(Looking at you Mukul :3)\n\nAccording to you, who should ideally apply for this job?\n\nThere are multiple roles in every software company, so your resume should show which specific role you want to go to clearly. Other than that, somebody that loves algorithms and data should definitely apply here, as the work here seems really interesting( I haven\u2019t started yet properly, but just judging from what I have seen until now)\n\n6) Any specific advice you want to give to the junta sitting for internships this year.\n\nThe most important advice here is that after clearing the screening test, your job is more than halfway done. They are here to hire you and you shouldn\u2019t give them any reason not to. Be confident, think loudly, and voice out what you want from the role as well. Try to forget previously messed up interviews as well and focus on the current one, for e.g. I couldn\u2019t solve the easy two-pointer question in my first interview in the first go because I was still mulling over the Microsoft interview I messed up 5 minutes before :P. Other than that, rejections are normal and the CDC process itself depends a lot on your luck. So don\u2019t give up after initial failures and keep the grind going!\n\nWhat are some of the major points you think would be valid to mention in your CV while targeting this profile?(any specific suggestions you would like to make?)\n\nTry to have multiple projects/internships in your resume specific to the profile you want. Not every project needs to be related, I had a core project on my resume too. But it is good to have a few showcasing your past experience, which will prove your interest in the role, and give you some knowledge beforehand(this would help during your internship as well because you will be familiar with the frameworks/things you will be working on). Also, having projects related to the role will help you talk about stuff that you know in and out of, helping you steer the interview to your advantage.\n\nAll the best to all the juniors sitting for internships this year and in the future!"

        "content": "FORESIGHT(2022): Summer Internship at Honeywell | Aman Mishra\n\n--\n\nListen\n\nBrief Introduction:\n\nHello! I am Aman Mishra, a pre-final year undergraduate student at the Department of Industrial and Systems Engineering, IIT Kharagpur. I am from Kolkata. Last year, I received an internship offer in the Software Profile from Honeywell via the CDC internship drive.\n\nHow did you get into Honeywell? What was the selection procedure?\n\nThe first step of the selection procedure was a coding test comprising 2 questions to be solved in 1 hour. The questions were doable if someone had practiced questions thoroughly from InterviewBit. The time of submission was also considered while shortlisting candidates for the next round as many people were able to solve both questions. Students from all the departments were allowed to take the coding test.\n\nThe next step involved technical rounds followed by an HR round. I had to sit through only 1 technical round, whereas some students had to go through 2 technical rounds. The technical round had a couple of coding questions followed by some questions on the OOP concepts and a brief discussion about one of the projects I mentioned on my CV. The last round of the process was the HR round where standard HR questions were asked along with a discussion on projects mentioned on my CV.\n\nHow to prepare for them?\n\nSince the selection process primarily revolves around judging your problem-solving skills and knowledge of Data Structures and Algorithms, it is advisable to practice on the various coding platforms like Codeforces, CodeChef, Atcoder, etc. to sharpen your problem-solving skills and build a temperament to solve problems in a time-bound situation. InterviewBit is a must-do resource since it contains questions like what is asked in the interview rounds. Try giving the CDC Series Contests conducted by Grimoire of Code (GOC) for a good practice of the coding tests.\n\nObject-Oriented Programming Fundamentals, as well as puzzles, are also asked quite often asked in the interview rounds, hence it is recommended to prepare them well. Other than these, one or two weeks before the CDC interviews, start giving mock interviews so that you become well versed in communicating your solution approach clearly to the interviewer.\n\nWhat difficulties did you face while preparing for this Company/Profile? How did you overcome this problem?\n\nA specific issue that I faced was not being able to properly explain the approach of my solution. To overcome this, I took some help from seniors and friends and asked them to take mock interviews which eventually helped me to improve.\n\nAccording to you, who should ideally apply for this job?\n\nAnyone interested in software development.\n\nAny specific advice you want to give to the junta sitting for internships this year.\n\nThe entire process is very taxing so be mentally prepared for it and keep yourself motivated throughout. Make a group of friends who are targeting the same profile as yours and prepare with them. Preparing in a group will keep you motivated as well as ensure that you do not miss important deadlines. Make sure that you have prepared your CV very well and got it reviewed by your seniors. Lastly, accept the fact that rejection is a part of this entire process. So do not lose hope in case you face any rejections, trust the process, keep working hard, and you will eventually sail through it. Just Keep Calm and Keep Coding. Good Luck :)\n\nWhat are some of the major points you think would be valid to mention in your CV while\n\ntargeting this profile? (Any specific suggestions you would like to make?)\n\nTry to mention at least one group project (if you have any) since group projects show that you are a team player and have the skills to collaborate with others to solve any problem. If you have good ranks in coding competitions (like KickStart, Codejam, HackerCup) and good ratings on sites like Codeforces and CodeChef, do mention those in your resume as these ratings and ranks function as a good proxy for your coding skills. Most importantly, do not put anything in your resume that you cannot defend or are not confident about."

I was offered a summer internship as SDE at Honeywell.\n\nSelection procedure\n\nThere are a total of three rounds of the selection process, i.e. the coding round at first obviously, then followed by Technical Round, and at the end HR round.\n\n1.The coding round consists of three questions with medium-level questions (at least one DP) within a time limit of 90 mins if I remember correctly.\n\n2.The technical round questions are a function of the CV of the candidate. The interviewer might ask to code the basics of DS (like Priority Queue, BST) and some popular algorithms (Knapsack, BFS, etc.). Other than that the candidate will be asked a handful of conceptual questions and a tricky puzzle in the end.\n\n3.The last round with HR is rather more relaxing and non-technical. However, HR might be interested in co-curriculums of the candidate and evaluate his/her worth to the company.\n\nHow to prepare for them?\n\nI did appear in CDC with just the right amount of preparations, not more not less. For one month I completely focused on Competitive Programming targeting 4\u20135 questions everyday topic wise. Apart from that my previous projects helped me to make an impression in interview rounds.\n\nYour Project Details\n\nI belonged to a small team of other interns.

The product consists of a dashboard that allows users to operate and analyze asset statistics.\n\nHow was your experience working from home?What difficulties did you face?\n\nWork from home did have some pros and cons as well. We had flexibility in time slots of work even though we had meetings twice a day. However, we did miss out on the real-time exposure of regular offline internships. We soon got acquainted with the work culture.\n\nApart from the technical level of difficulty, I didn\u2019t encounter any form of hurdle during my tenure.\n\nWhat effect could Covid have in the upcoming internship process?\n\nSpeaking from my point of view, Covid does change the hiring culture of companies in general. Now the hiring staff can just establish a remote video call instead of conducting 24\u00d77 interviews of candidates on campus. This raises a level of uncertainty in the hiring process and adds lots of stray factors.\n\nAccording to you who should ideally apply for this intern\n\nThis company is best known for global-wide services in almost every field.

        "content": "FORESIGHT(2021): Summer Internship at KPIT Technologies Ltd | Keshav Bagri\n\n--\n\nListen\n\nBrief Introduction\n\nI am Keshav Bagri a final year undergraduate student of the Department of Mechanical Engineering enrolled in its 4-year course. I am about to complete my summer internship at KPIT Technologies Ltd. I am also working for the Centre for Automotive Research, The Ohio State University.\n\nSelection Procedure\n\nI received an email from MFTP containing a PDF with a list of projects KPIT was offering this year. This PDF consisted of projects in the domain of electric vehicles, driverless vehicles, ML, Data Science, and Mechanical Engineering. Next, I had to fill a form with my personal details, skills, and 3 projects, in preferential order and provide an innovative solution to the project, if applicable. The first round was essentially based on this form and my CV which was submitted to CDC. The next round was the interview, for which a total of 16 students were shortlisted, for different projects. The interview was based on the conceptual knowledge for the project I had selected in the form, my CV, and basic programming questions. It should be noted that the programming round is subject to the project you have applied for and may or may not be applicable in every case.\n\nHow to prepare for them?\n\nSince there is no test involved, the preparation is completely limited to the interview. For this, I\u2019d recommend that you should be thorough with your CV. More than 75% of my interview was meticulously based on my CV. They even asked questions about the projects/internships which were not connected to the internship project I had applied for. Apart from this, try to gather some information about the projects that you have chosen in the form. Towards the end of the interview, I was asked about my familiarity with the project and how helpful it would be for them. The programming round was something I wasn\u2019t prepared for. I stumbled on a couple of questions but I managed to give the answers for the rest of them, so they seemed to be satisfied with it. In your case, if you think your project may require you to code, then you should prepare for the programming questions, at least to some extent.\n\nProject details\n\nMy project is related to driverless vehicles in general. Title \u2014 \u201cMemory footprint and inference time reduction for Deep Learning models\u201d. Deep learning models, used in driverless vehicles for object detection, motion planning, etc. are computationally extensive in terms of memory requirement and time they take to generate the output. This is a challenging task because the deployment of these models on edge devices like microcontrollers or custom hardware having substantially lesser resources available for computation is difficult, considering the cost and availability of these edge devices. My job was to reduce the complexity of the selected models using open source AI compilers and Deep Learning frameworks and perform a comparative analysis based on the results. Finally, these results will be published in a research article.\n\nHow was your experience working from home? What difficulties did you face?WFH experience isn\u2019t something you would want for your summer internship. The recruiters tried their best to arrange for offline interaction. Nevertheless, the situation didn\u2019t allow for one. I didn\u2019t face any difficulty as such since I had good internet connectivity and my mentors were very helpful in resolving the issues I encountered throughout the internship. Overall, as far as learning is concerned, this experience was fruitful since I got to know a lot about things, I wasn\u2019t very familiar with.\n\nWhat effect could COVID have in the upcoming internship process?\n\nThe present situation is very similar to that of the last year, with the only difference being in the timeline. If you are interested in the core sector, you might encounter some hurdles because of intense competition, but then again, uncertainties and challenges are a part of life. You don\u2019t have any choice but to navigate through these obstacles and make the best out of this internship experience. You may feel good after getting a day-1 or day-2 internship, but in the long run, honestly, it doesn\u2019t matter. Your efforts and the experience you gain from this endeavor, are the only things that you should focus on. Patience is something which you must have during the entire season; I learnt this in a difficult way ;)\n\nAccording to you, who should ideally apply for this internship?\n\nIf you are interested in the automotive domain, then you should definitely apply for this internship. KPIT works extensively in the domain of automotive engineering, encompassing its various areas. Also, they offer projects in multiple areas as I mentioned earlier, which can be appealing.\n\nAnd what advice will you give to them?\n\n:: Conceptual understanding of the projects that you have worked on prior to the interview, and details related to the project you are applying for, will surely make you stand out of the crowd. For instance, even though I wasn\u2019t very confident during the programming round, my CV and understanding of the projects I had worked on, was something that they actually liked.\n\nNow, since the CV preparation on ERP is over, the best you can do is to prepare well for the interview.

In the 2020 CDC internship drive, I received a Research Internship in Adobe Big Data Lab for nearly 13 weeks.\n\nSelection Procedure :\n\nThe selection was divided into two steps :\n\na. Written Test: Medium level Questions on Data Structure And Algorithm, Probability and Statistics, Some direct questions from 50 challenges in Probability and few other basic questions on OOPS, DBMS\n\nb.Interview Round: Selected students had to further appear for a 1-hour long interview round where detailed discussions on projects mentioned in the resume were discussed. The exact working of some machine learning and deep learning algorithms were asked.\n\nFor me specifically, many questions were related to the language model (maybe because most of my work till then was on NLP). Also, 2 basic level questions from array and time complexity optimization were asked. This was the final round.\n\nc.Practicing questions from Interview bit, geeks for geeks,50 challenges in probability would suffice. For revising data science concepts towards data science.com, machine learning mastery, Datacamp, and Udemy have many resources.\n\nYour Project Details :\n\nImprove Digital Marketing Workflow using Topological Data Analysis. During the beginning of my project, we were given only the term Topological Data Analysis. From building the problem statement to the solution, all were based on interns\u2019 thought processes and decisions.\n\nHow was your experience working from home?\n\nI would not like to term it tricky because Adobe ensured that we have the best experience ever in the online version, but brainstorming ideas and discussion on the whiteboard would have been better than using a virtual Microsoft whiteboard.\n\nWhat effect could Covid have in the upcoming internship process?\n\nAs the internship process has already started and I see the same company and profiles coming for the CDC internship last year, I don\u2019t know the effect of covid there but the number of interns selected and PPO offered might be reduced due to covid for some companies.\n\nAccording to you, who should ideally apply for this internship?\n\nAnyone who has a keen interest in machine learning and deep learning and wants to innovate something in this field must apply for the internship.\n\nWhat advice will you give to them?\n\nFor an interview, be very thorough with Machine Learning and Deep Learning Algorithms, Optimization Algorithms, Evaluation metrics. In general, I would advise everyone to be patient as this entire process of securing an internship can be overwhelming at times. Maybe you don\u2019t guarantee training in Day1/Day2 or the company you desire, but don\u2019t let this stop you from giving your best. Eventually, things will fall in place."

        "content": "FORESIGHT(2021): Summer Internship at Amazon| Soumitra Das\n\n--\n\nListen\n\nBrief Introduction :\n\nI am Soumitra Das, currently a final(4th) year student from the Department of Computer Science and Engineering. I completed my internship(SDE role) at Amazon Development Centre, Bangalore, this summer.\n\nI applied for Software Development and Analyst role both. The Selection procedure includes shortlisting( for some companies), then a screening test followed by an interview.\n\nSelection Procedure :\n\nAll the companies ask coding questions in the screening test. In addition, for analyst profile questions from Mathematics(probability and algebra), Machine Learning, Logical Ability, Data Interpretation, and Comprehensive English were asked. Particularly to say about Amazon, it was open to circuital branch, and the screening test consisted of 4 sections -\n\na. Code Debug (20 minutes) \u2014 Finding bugs in 7 pieces of code.\n\nb. Coding test (70 minutes) \u2014 Solving 2 problems.\n\nc. Work Styles Assessment (10\u201315 minutes) \u2014 In this section, you will be asked to choose to what extent a provided statement represents your work style.\n\nd. Logical Ability(35 minutes) \u2014 You will be asked a series of problem-solving MCQs.\n\nAmazon shortlisted 34 for an interview.\n\nI was shortlisted for Honeywell(Software research) and Oracle(SDE). At Honeywell, the interviewer told me to introduce myself at first. Then he asked about my project and a few questions \u2014 1 probability( rolling the bullet), 2 puzzles( 3 switches and 3 bulbs, Mislabelled 3 baskets), and 2 coding problems( 1 from DP). The interview went well but I did not get any call for the HR round. In Oracle, I was asked questions from LinkedList, but the interview was not satisfactory.\n\nOn Day3 though I was shortlisted for Amazon, WellsFargo, MasterCard, and Huawei, I sat for the first 3. The day started with the interview in Wells Fargo. The interviewer asked about my project and then asked if I am comfortable with Computer Networks and Operating systems. I replied the subjects would be taught in the 6th semester. Then he moved to the coding questions. A couple of hours later, my turn came for the interview in Amazon. I was asked to introduce myself. He asked a bit about my project and then moved to the code part. I was asked a question based on graph and search. I first came up with a naive solution and told it. He then asked me to optimize it in terms of time and memory. I took the help of Map container and told the approach to the interviewer. He seemed to be not satisfied with the solution at first from a complexity point. I then told him the complexity analysis. After that, he told me to write the code in the editor(syntactically correct). Finally, I was told if I had any questions about Amazon on which I asked about the work culture and the kind of work that is done there. As soon as I completed my Amazon interview I sat for MasterCard. The initial part of the conversation was almost the same as other companies. Then I was asked some questions (1 from DP) and I had to write the code of the DP. The interview for MasterCard went well.\n\nJust after the interview with MasterCard, I got confirmation of my selection by Amazon.No further round was there. Amazon is a big company and due to the quality of work there I immediately accepted the offer.\n\nAlgo \u2014 This first thing that is needed is \u2014 be thorough with the concepts of Algorithm (especially Linked List, Graph and Search, Tree, Dynamic Programming, and DP).\n\nHow to prepare for them?\n\nI had algorithms in my 3rd semester as a core subject. In the winter after the 3rd semester, I practiced some DP questions from geeks for geeks. When the lockdown started in March 2020 I started with InterviewBit topic-wise and took the help of the solution there when I got stuck. In May I postponed InterviewBit and revised the concepts of the algorithm from Cormen. Then as the day of screening tests got closer I again started doing random questions from important topics in InterviewBit. Before interview days I read some company-specific blogs of interviews from geeks for geeks and looked through company-specific questions accordingly.\n\nTo practice some mixed bag of questions, leetcode is also a good platform I think.\n\nPuzzles \u2014 For puzzles, questions can be practiced from geeks for geeks, interview bit, and leetcode as well.\n\nFor the Analyst role especially \u2014 You should be handy with ML concepts along with the mathematical proofs and Matrix algebra, Probability and Statistics, and Algebra(Quadratic Equation-JEE standard) as well. You can follow these for probability \u2014 https://brainstellar.com/, 50 Challenging problems.\n\nProject Details :\n\nI was working in the payment team of Amazon. My project includes designing and developing an API and integrating it with another API. I had to test the API functionality and the integration as well. Though I can\u2019t share the exact details about the project I worked in JAVA along with some frameworks.\n\nThe languages and the frameworks which are to be used are project and company dependant but you should be familiar with OOP concepts and any previous experience in developing software will help you.\n\nHow was your experience working from home? What difficulties did you face?\n\nWork from home was definitely challenging. I missed the opportunity to interact with my teammates and my fellow interns in person.\n\nBut the company tried to make the internship hassle-free and interactive as much as possible. They organized a smooth virtual onboarding session and I was provided with IT equipment. I was assigned a manager and a mentor with whom I had regular meetings on weekly basis. I also got the chance to be present in the team meetings. The team was really helpful. I could approach any team member anytime to solve doubts. Meeting with the teammates virtually kept me in vibe with the organization.\n\nI did not see any change in the number of offers with respect to the previous years in the profiles I applied for. So I am assuming it will be the same this year also. No need to worry.\n\nAccording to you who should ideally apply for this intern?\n\nPeople who are interested in algorithms and Data Structure and want to pursue a career in software development can apply for Amazon.\n\nAnd what advice will you give to them?\n\nRevise the things before exams. If you have time after each screening test, discuss or solve the uncompleted or left questions that were asked and looked through the concepts you missed.\n\nDON\u2019T FAKE YOUR CV UP TO A LITTLE EXTENT!!! Be thorough with your Project. Prepare this question -What were the challenges you faced in your project and how did you overcome that?\n\nBefore the interview do a bit of research on the principle of the company. Be HONEST with every answer in the interview.\n\nBe calm. There is no reason to be anxious due to your poor performance in any screening test or in case you haven\u2019t got any offer till Day2.\n\nGood Luck!"

This summer I worked as a Software Engineering Intern at Salesforce.\n\nSelection procedure\n\nThere was one online coding shortlisting round, predominantly CP-based. The top candidates were then allowed to go through the main interviews. There were three technical rounds and an HR round. All of the technical rounds were CP-based and predominantly tested our thinking and coding abilities. One of them (the second one for me) involved evaluation based on past Internships and Projects, alongside solving algorithmic problems.\n\nHow to prepare for them?\n\nI feel that having practiced regularly from LeetCode would definitely help the candidate in clearing the preliminary rounds. Also, I would suggest that you keep participating in Codeforces / Codechef contests frequently in order to be in the habit of solving problems in a time-bounded format. However, in the final technical round, I was given one single problem, which I think was of 2000\u20132200 rating in Codeforces having a CP background did help me during the interview.\n\nYour Project Details\n\nI was in the Health Cloud team at Salesforce. My project was aimed at recognizing, analyzing, and storing data automatically, directly from medical conversations. I worked on the NLP domain of automating the storage of patient interactions. We automated the patient onboarding process, to lay the groundwork by a collection of patient demographics information and storage using FHIR standards in the Healthcare Organisation. It executed an automatic voice conversation with a new patient trying to register himself/herself to a healthcare provider (through a phone call) without any manual intervention, and updated the analyzed data to the Health Organisation Database. It was an amazing learning experience for me!!!\n\nHow was your experience working from home? What difficulties did you face?\n\nIt was awesome, I\u2019d say. The Ohana Salesforce is very welcoming and I enjoyed each day. My manager is a KGP-alumnus and my mentor talked to me at least twice each day. Our team (from KGP, with Shashank Bonda and Ankit Saurabh) even won the InTurn hackathon at Salesforce. Salesforce also gifted us with a lot of amazing Swags very frequently throughout the duration of the internship and also provided us with all necessities (like a laptop). Though I miss the in-office experience and had few connection issues due to the Yaas cyclone, the remote internship journey was extremely well managed.\n\nWhat effect could Covid have in the upcoming internship process?\n\nOne trend that I have seen during Covid, is that a lot of people are participating in coding contests very frequently these days, probably due to more time available aside from college. The competition for tech internships is growing tougher each year in Covid. So, even the importance of participating in CP contests and being thorough with the algorithms and data structures is also growing with time.\n\nAccording to you who should ideally apply for this internship?\n\nPeople who love solving algorithmic problems and want to get a wonderfully memorable exposure to working at a Tech firm should definitely apply for interning at Salesforce. If you are a tech geek, it\u2019s an experience you don\u2019t want to miss in life.\n\nAnd what advice will you give to them?\n\nIf you are good at CP and have a decent background in Tech, you\u2019ll definitely ace coding interviews at top companies like Salesforce.\n\nThis is my coding during the internship.\n\nabj_macbook.png\n\n(144K)\n\nThis is our winning team (Hackathon) at Salesforce.\n\nhack.jpeg\n\n(176K)"

        "content": "FORESIGHT(2021): Summer Internship at Goldman Sachs |Hardik Tibrewal\n\n--\n\nListen\n\nBrief Introduction\n\nHey everyone, I am Hardik Tibrewal, a Final Year Undergraduate student from the Department of Electronics and Electrical Communication, IIT Kharagpur. I completed an internship at Goldman Sachs in Summer 2021. I was selected as part of their on-campus recruitment program in IIT-KGP.\n\nSelection procedure\n\nThe selection procedure was Goldman Sachs consisted of two stages. The first was an online test conducted on Hackerrank. It consisted of 5 sections: Computer Science Theory, Probability and Statistics, 2 easy coding problems, 1 medium coding problem, and English Writing skills. Your CGPA is the 6th metric on which they judge you. The selection criterion was performing to their standards in at least 3 of the 6 areas, as far as I remember. If shortlisted, there were 3 rounds of interviews. All of them were technical rounds, with some rounds focusing on probability and statistics, whereas the others focusing on DSA(Data Structures and Algorithms) problems. There was no HR round.\n\nHow to prepare for them?\n\nFor the online test, keep practicing CP till the end (see the Metakgp page for resources). In the month when the tests are scheduled to happen, start brushing up on Comp. Sci. basics and Prob-Stats, courses which you will have most likely completed by then, either with your institute curriculum or online. You can practice writing short answers to questions like \u201cWhat are your motivations in life?\u201d and other common questions like this if you aren\u2019t confident in your writing skills. For interviews, keep working on your DSA knowledge, and go through the basics of Object-oriented programming if you aren\u2019t familiar with it. Also check out sites like BrainStellar for practicing probability puzzles, which will be asked in the first round.\n\nYour Project Details\n\nI was assigned a Software Development project, which was designing functionality for one of their applications. I worked with Java, but the projects are assigned to you and you aren\u2019t offered a choice, so don\u2019t worry about the specific skills you will need to know before your internship. If you get a software role, it will be beneficial if you have worked on at least some small project of your own and are familiar with Git, at least. Even if you aren\u2019t, you will have time to figure it out.\n\nHow was your experience working from home? What difficulties did you face?\n\nThe company tried to make WFH as pleasant and interactive as possible. While you obviously miss out on a lot of experiences and, most importantly, networking opportunities online, the overall experience was great for me. As long as you have a decent laptop, a good internet connection, and take the initiative to reach out to people when needed, you won\u2019t face any issues.\n\nWhat effect could Covid have in the upcoming internship process?\n\nUnless the dreaded third wave arrives before the selection process, the situation faced by this batch will be the same as we faced last year. Please try to arrange for a reliable internet connection and power supply if you can. Try to find a quiet spot without any disturbances or people near you, since that may cause issues during online tests. Form a small group of friends with whom you can talk and vent out any frustrations you will inevitably have during the process.\n\nAccording to you who should ideally apply for this intern?\n\nPeople who are flexible regarding the work they will be given because depending on your tests and interviews, you will be assigned a role that may be finance-oriented or software-oriented. You may be asked for your preference in the interviews, but the final decision will be up to the firm, and you won\u2019t be able to change it. If this is not an issue for you, you can happily apply for this role.\n\nAnd what advice will you give to them?\n\nPeople tend to ignore their communication skills when applying for interns. Do not do that. Your communication skills will play a significant part in your process (at least in my opinion). Keep improving your DSA and Prob-Stats knowledge. Also, be in touch with PlaceComm members on the day of your interviews, so they can help you if anything goes wrong. Don\u2019t be afraid to reach out to seniors if you have questions. Best of luck"

        "content": "FORESIGHT(2021): Summer Internship at Microsoft | Shyamvanshikumar Singh\n\n--\n\nListen\n\nBrief Introduction:\n\nHi, I am Shyamvanshikumar Singh, a final year undergraduate student in Electronics and Electrical Communication. I completed my 8-week long summer internship at Microsoft. I was part of the Professional Services (Microsoft Digital) Team which is part of Microsoft\u2019s Core services engineering and operations group.\n\nSelection Procedure:\n\nThe selection process involved one coding round followed by 3 interview rounds. Before last year Microsoft used to conduct 2 coding contests before shortlisting for interviews, but last year they conducted only one and used CPGA for shortlisting.\n\nThe coding round for most companies is conducted on the Hackerrank platform, but for Microsoft, it is usually conducted on the Mettl platform which many don\u2019t find friendly. Just be a bit more cautious and calm while giving the test if you are not familiar with the platform. The round consisted of 3 questions which were the same for all students. The questions were easy and were from topics like dynamic programming, greedy algorithm and one was a simple brute force problem.\n\nThe first two interview rounds were again coding based where one question was asked in each round. The first round included designing a sorting algorithm without using comparison operators while the second round included a DP-based question. During the interview, it is very important that while thinking about the solution of the problem you think out loud. As in my case, it helped me to get some guidance from the interviewer for getting to the correct solution. The final round was mostly based on topics mentioned in my CV and some problem-solving. The whole interview experience was pretty chill.\n\nHow to prepare for them:\n\nFor software engineering-based profiles a good knowledge of Algorithm and Data Structures is essential. You can take the Algorithms I course of the CSE department or can do an online course on DSA. Once the basics of DSA are clear, there are many sources to practice problem-solving. GeeksforGeeks, Leetcode, InterviewBits, A2OJ ladder, etc. I would suggest selecting any two of the available resources, instead of jumping between different platforms. Apart from these, you can participate in competitive programming contests on code forces and CodeChef to get an idea of your progress.\n\nMy internship project details:\n\nMy project was involved a Machine learning-based multi-class classification problem. It involved creating different machine learning models, creating Restful APIs, and some work involving Microsoft Azure. The project was mostly coded in C#. Most of the technologies used in the project can be learned during the internship itself and there are no prerequisites.\n\nInternship experience:\n\nThe internship experience was really good. People are always present there to help you out in any difficulty you face, whether related to the project. Many fun and informative events were conducted throughout the internship period. The project work was also very interesting, and the project timeline was pretty lenient. The only thing lacking during the period was interaction with fellow interns due to the online work mode.\n\nWhat effect could Covid have in the upcoming internship process?\n\nNow, mostly all of us have become accustomed to the online mode of learning and working. Last year also the entire process was online and went pretty smooth. During the whole process in an online manner, we become lonely and try to be in touch with all batch mates and seniors. Talking with people will reduce all the anxiety related to the process. Be confident and hope for the best.\n\nWho should apply for this internship?\n\nAll the technology enthusiasts and coding geeks can apply for this opportunity. There is a lot of scope for learning new technologies and skills during the internship period.\n\nAdvice for them:\n\nMy advice for you all is to be confident and believe in yourself. Be firm on your fundamentals. The internship process itself will be a learning experience. There will be days when things won\u2019t go your way. Try to learn from them. Don\u2019t get demotivated when you don\u2019t get a shot in some of the companies. Again have belief in yourself, and you will find a company matching your skill sets."

        "content": "FORESIGHT(2020): Summer Internship Mathworks| Tanmay Das\n\n--\n\nListen\n\nBrief Introduction:\n\nMy name is Tanmay Das and I am pursuing B.Tech in Instrumentation Engineering at IIT Kharagpur. I did my summer internship at Mathworks (Hyderabad Campus). Mathworks is basically a product-based multinational company whose major product is MATLAB. The internship was for 2 months and I worked under Hardware-Software Codesign team on HDL Coder toolbox of MATLAB.\n\nSelection Procedure:\n\nLast year, Mathworks was open for all departments. There were two rounds for selections. First was the coding round where questions related to programming were asked. There were MCQ as well as coding questions. 12 people were shortlisted in the first round. The second round was a Video Call interview. The interviewer asked a few questions on CV and then provided a hackerrank interactive platform where I was asked to write and run certain codes. Then I was asked a few questions on C++ STL library and whether I want to go for higher studies or not. Out of 12, 5 were selected for the internship and three of us chose Hyderabad campus.\n\nHow to prepare for them:\n\nFor the coding round, one should have proper knowledge of data structures and time complexity of different algorithms(like sorting, searching etc). One can study all the relevant theories from GeeksforGeeks. Everything is pretty well explained there. For practice, one can refer to InterviewBit or Leetcode. One needs to understand that there is cut-throat competition in all the online tests so cutoffs are generally quite high and one needs to solve most of the questions in order to qualify to the next round. In such a situation speed really matters along with problem-solving skills.\n\nYour Project Details:\n\nAs I mentioned above, I worked under the Hardware Software codesign team. My work was to build a feature in HDL Workflow Advisor of HDL Coder toolbox. It may sound like some hardware stuff but the work was completely on software development. All the basic knowledge related to hardware was quite easy to understand and was learnt parallelly during the course of my project. I did not have any prior knowledge of the toolbox I was working on and had the least experience of working in MATLAB but I did not face any difficulty. Mathworks provides lots of online training to all its new joinees so that no faces any problem while onboarding.\n\nHow was your experience working from home? What difficulties did you face?\n\nWhat effect could COVID have in the upcoming internship process?\n\nMathworks is still hiring students for their internship program. However, it may happen that they take less number of people as compared to last year. But this is just an assumption from my end. I do not have any clear idea of how many interns they are willing to hire this year.\n\nAccording to you, who should ideally apply for this internship?\n\nMathworks works on a variety of fields. There are a huge number of toolboxes present in MATLAB. Anyone who is interested in any of hardware, software, image processing, computer vision, deep learning can consider Mathworks for an internship.\n\nAnd what advice will you give to them?\n\nTo the Mathworks internship aspirants:\n\nThe selections are purely based on coding skills and do not involve any other knowledge. The questions are not that tough. Be confident and fluent during the interview. The people who are willing to go for higher studies in future are generally not preferred by interviewers because they invest a lot of resources and time during the internship and won\u2019t like someone to quit the company after the internship or after working for one or two years.\n\nTo the people who get selected:\n\nThere is a lot of scope to learn at Mathworks. They have a separate portal which consists of all kinds of interactive online training that you need to know. At first, one joins the Engineering Development Group Department in Mathworks where the basic aim is to groom the individual so that he/she can explore all the options, know more about the company and then finally settle into one of key areas at Mathworks. There are a lot of career options open for the future within Mathworks. The amount of career growth will be huge. Regarding the evaluation for PPO, apart from work on the project, one is also evaluated on the basis of soft skills such as communication skills, presentation skills, leadership skills, ability to take initiative, time management, willingness to participate etc. So make sure you pay attention to these things too.\n\nAt last, to all the internship aspirants, I would say, be calm and patient. There will be times when things will not happen according to your plan even if you are putting a lot of efforts but everything will fall into place as the time will pass. Never lose hope and keep doing hard work. Try to learn as much as you can. It will help you grow as an individual.\n\nAll the best,\n\nTanmay Das"

The test had 3 coding questions and we had to solve it within 1 hour.\n\n\u25cf After the online coding round, they conducted a Group Fly round where they gave a problem statement to all the candidates and we had to discuss with the mentors and come up with a good solution as well as implementing the solution on pen and paper. Be sure to improve your implementation skills. No matter how easy the algorithm is, you need to implement it fast on pen and paper. There was a time limit of 1 hour. Be sure to talk to your mentors properly and implement your solution efficiently on the paper.\n\n\u25cf Those who cleared the group fly round advanced to the Interview. Personally, I had three rounds of interviews. In the first round, They asked me about algorithms and data structure. I had to write code on the paper for all the questions. In the second round, I was asked questions from Natural Language Processing and AI. Luckily, I was somewhat aware of these fields and I was able to answer the questions. In the third round, they asked me about the projects I did on my previous internships. Surprisingly, I had to write code on the paper in my third round too. So it is highly recommended to practice writing bug-free code on the paper.\n\nHow to prepare for them:\n\nPractice, practice and practice. Those who are familiar with competitive programming will get benefits above others. But it is very easy to crack good companies with two or three months of rigorous practice. Some good resources will be: geekforgeeks, Interviewbit, Leetcode. If these sources are okayish for you go for codeforces, spoj, HackerEarth etc. For dual degree people, be sure to cover OS, DBMS and networks a little bit for safety. For particularly Microsoft, be sure to improve your implementation skill.\n\nYour Project Details:\n\nI worked for the Office Project (\u201cProject\u201d is one of the many products of Office365) team. I worked on an open-ended problem based on Natural Language Processing. I had some experience in NLP, So I didn\u2019t face many difficulties in approaching the problem from my side. They usually go through your resume while assigning you to various teams and go through your past projects, any special skills or courses taken, but in many cases, it can be randomly allotted as well.\n\nCompany Culture:\n\nMicrosoft takes quite a lot of pride in its culture after Satya Nadella became CEO. Some of the key points are:\n\n\u25cf Flexible Timing. You can come and leave the office anytime you want. Everyone is happy as long as you are doing your job well. No one rolls an eye at your office timing or your uniforms.\n\n\u25cf One Microsoft. This is a term used frequently within Microsoft. This signifies although there are lots and lots of teams within Microsoft, everyone is under Microsoft. So you can ask your doubts to anyone within your team as well as out of your team. For my case, I took a lot of help from a senior software engineer in Redmond and he was very friendly and helped me a lot throughout my internship.\n\n\u25cf Growth Mindset. This signifies Microsoft wants to hire people who want to learn it all rather than who knows it all.\n\n\u25cf When it comes to a fun office environment, Microsoft has numerous pool tables, foosball tables etc. There is an Xbox room (obviously). You can play table tennis, cricket, volleyball etc. (just google \u201cMicrosoft IDC Hyderabad campus\u201d). There will be a team outing, lunch and you will be getting goodies from Microsoft.\n\nAccording to you who should ideally apply for the intern:\n\nAnyone who loves computer science, coding and who wants to work in a big tech company and wants to learn about the Technologies of Tech giants should definitely apply for this internship. On a side note, those who are interested in pursuing research should not apply. One positive point of this internship is you will get the Microsoft brand in your resume.\n\nAnd what advice will you give to them:\n\nJust a piece of general advice, don\u2019t just run after the money and try to run away from the hype called \u201cday 1 intern\u201d. Try to choose companies wisely according to your interest."

There are more divisions located at Vadodara, Surat, Mumbai etc. However, no choices are considered for locations and these are allocated based on the project you choose. RIL-DMD was huge and had 19 plants manufacturing various things like PVC, PTA etc.\n\nSelection Procedure:\n\nThe selection is done on the basis of the test that you\u2019ll give and your resume. There was no GD or interview round. The selection process involved a written test and resume short-listing. Initially, every applicant is allowed to sit for the written test. The selection is done on the basis of your test scores and your resume. Given that you have cleared the test cut-off and you have a decent GPA (>7.5), you have a high chance of getting selected.\n\nThe test was divided into two sections, each of 30 minutes. The aptitude section was easy and had 30 questions. You\u2019ll require a good knowledge of the core subjects for the next 50 technical questions.\n\nHow to prepare for them:\n\nAptitude questions can be practised from any standard prep book. For technical questions, instrumentation students should study ID-1 and ID-2 mostly.\n\nYour Project Details:\n\nThe title of my project was \u201cCybersecurity in DCS and PLC systems.\u201d I mostly had to study about the threats and their consequences in real-time operations. The work done is mostly confidential and they follow strict rules to prevent data leakage by insiders.\n\nThe Internship:\n\nThe work during the internship is not very intense and you\u2019ll get a lot of time to learn about things outside of the scope of your project. I\u2019d call my internship boring as they do not give much work to interns as most of the work control some critical infrastructure and people can be entrusted to that without proper training. The people are friendly and are always ready to help. I\u2019d say, it\u2019s nice if you want to see real engineering up close. The accommodation arrangements were good, you get bachelor flats with ACs.\n\nCompany Culture:\n\nHad to work for 6 days (huge bummer), from 8:30 am to 5:30 pm (another bummer). However, the people you work with are highly experienced and friendly. My mentor was the senior manager of the instruments section and helped me a lot to learn everything about my project. The location was also very remote, had to go to nearby cities for movies and all.\n\nAccording to you who should ideally apply for the intern:\n\nPeople looking for a proper industrial experience in core engineering should go for it. I\u2019d say, you should choose your projects wisely because a lot depends on it, make sure you know about the thing you\u2019re choosing."

There was no CGPA cutoff or any other pre-requisite criteria. There were 2 phases in this hiring process.\n\nFirst there was a coding round on Hackerrank where we were given 3 problems to solve within an hour. Those who solved at least 2 problems properly were shortlisted for the personal interviews.\n\nIn the next phase there were 2 rounds of personal interviews which according to Flipkart\u2019s lingo are also known as \u201cPS & DS Algo\u201d. The best thing about these rounds is resume plays a very limited role since it is totally based on problem solving skills which ensures no bias among the candidates. Even the problems asked to every candidate were of similar difficulty. After this whole day process, 4 of us were selected as summer flinterns.\n\nHow to prepare for them:\n\nStrong grasp over Algorithms and Data Structures is the competency they look for. So practice problems from different topics of Algo and DS and spend some time on competitive coding platforms. Prior to the interview go through the FAQs for Software Development roles on geeksforgeeks. During the interviews, try to suggest the optimal solution and in case you\u2019re stuck ask for hints as well.\n\nYour Project Details:\n\nI was a part of the Logistics Insights Team at Ekart.

Being a bank, they didn\u2019t want to use any 3rd party APIs so I had to build everything from scratch. I had to configure Kafka and then build the utility in JAVA8 which was integrated into their pipeline of the trade reporting engine for Europe. My util generated and sent the status of different components of Kafka and also generated alerts in case of failure. Everyone was assigned adifferent kind of project and everyone had to work solely on that project.\n\nCompany Culture:\n\nThe environment here is quite chill and friendly. There are no time restrictions (come and go whenever comfortable depends on the timing in which zone you are working), the dress code is semi-formal or smart casuals. People are very easily approachable here, one can freely talk to any person at any position without any hesitation. They have a smart working environment where you can sit anywhere in office and work, there is no fixed seating areafor a person (you get smart cards for VMs which can be inserted in any keyboard). All in all, you grow here in a team, working together with different people at different locations. You get many treats and outings (depends solely on your team). People are very humble and generous, not only about the work but they will also guide you about the city, areas to visit and places suitable for your stay. They also have different coding competitions organized where they provide many goodies and also they organize many recreational activities. The workload is very minimal and you have enough time in hand to explore other lots of stuff.\n\nAccording to you who should ideally apply for the intern:\n\nAll the technology enthusiasts/ coding geeks/ finance loving people can apply. People who love finance but want to explore the technology perspective of it are the most suitable ones.\n\nAnd what advice will you give to them:\n\nCredit Suisse is majorly a multinational investment banking and financial service company. Someone might think that work here majorly is related to finance and in future, if you land at Credit Suisse, your field completely becomes finance-oriented. However, this is not completely true. But to understand the background of the work you are doing, you need tounderstand the finance behind the technological requirements, thus with time, you tend to develop more knowledge in finance. So yeah, you might get deeper into finance, but you won\u2019t get your hands off the technological work you do. If you join Credit Suisse, they have a special two-year program where you get to choose a different project in a different team of your interest after a year. The workload is very minimal for these two years, so people get alot of time to prepare for their masters as well.\n\nAlso, it\u2019s important to keep in mind that not everyone gets the same experience at any place. What you take out of this journey definitely depends on the firm, the team you are working in and also on you, how well you adapt yourself to a corporate environment, and how well you are able to interact and mix up with everyone around you.I would say that try to get the best out of whatever is present, learn from people around you. Don\u2019t lose hope, if something doesn\u2019t turn out to be the way you wanted, there is something much better ahead, just be \u201cPATIENT\u201d."

        "content": "FORESIGHT(2019): Summer Internship Tower Research Capital | Spandan Kumar Sahu\n\n--\n\nListen\n\n1) Brief Introduction:-\n\nMy name is Spandan Kumar Sahu, fifth year, dual degree student from Computer Science and Engineering Department. I did my internship at Tower Research Capital, Gurgaon, in summers 2019. Prior to that I had completed GSoC in summers 2017, and went for an internship at ITRI Taiwan in summers 2018.\n\n2) Selection procedure:-\n\nThe selection procedure is a resume review, followed by rounds of telephonic interview. The whole process is handled by CDC; interview takes place in CDC office and the resumes are directly forwarded by CDC.\n\n3) How to prepare for them?\n\nThe general process to prepare for a Tower interview is to be spotless in your concepts of Algorithms, Operating Systems, Networks and other core courses. Revision from GeeksForGeeks and InterviewBit helps.\n\n4) Your Project Details:-\n\nI can't reveal most details of my project, owing to a non-disclosure agreement, but it was a project on benchmarking, alerting and monitoring Ceph, a distributed data storage system.\n\n5) Company Culture:-\n\nThe company culture is great, with relaxed work timings and a lively office. People there are pretty knowledgeable as almost everyone is a topper of sorts of their respective colleges. They expect you to know your subjects thoroughly, but they will help you out, once you exhaust all your ideas.\n\n6) According to you who should ideally apply for this intern:-\n\nTower is pretty exclusive when it comes to interns selection from KGP. It almost always sticks to CS majors with CG in the upwards of 9.5. Either that, or you have to be good at something very specific they are looking at. From my understanding, they are currently looking for UI/UX developers, competitive programmers and people with experience in cloud computing.\n\n7) And what advice will you give to them:-\n\nTower isn't a traditional software company and is a relatively small team for the variety of domains they play in. So be prepared to face a wider variety of challenges, and learn to have fun solving them:)"
