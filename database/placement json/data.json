        "content": "FORESIGHT(2022): Placement at Tiger Analytics | Compilation\n\nBrief Introduction\n\nI\u2019m Arka Mandal. I am a dual degree student from the Mechanical Engineering department. I got placed at Tiger Analytics in the Data science role during the December placements.\n\nMy name is Samanvitha. I\u2019m a 5th year dual degree student from the Department of Civil Engineering with specialization in Environmental Engineering and Management. I\u2019m from Visakhapatnam, Andhra Pradesh.\n\nHow did you get into Tiger Analytics? What was the selection procedure?\n\nI got selected in Tiger Analytics \u2014 Data Science profile in the CDC placement drive. The company appeared on Day-3 of this year\u2019s placement session and the role was open to all the departments.\n\nComing to the selection procedure, there were 2 rounds of shortlisting tests. In the 1st online shortlist round, there were 2 sections (all questions were of MCQ type):\n\n1. Aptitude including quantitative aptitude, +2 level maths (few questions from conic sections) and general aptitude.\n\n2. Objective type questions on programming (like finding errors or output of the code, some theoretical, etc.). Most of them were of easy-moderate level but one needs to manage their time well to be able to get shortlisted for round 2.\n\nIn the 2nd shortlist round, there were 2 sections. 1st section had 3 questions (moderate level coding questions) out of which 2 are to be attempted and 2nd section had 2 questions (moderate-hard level coding questions) out of which 1 is to be attempted and the whole test must be completed in 1 hr. The platform was hackerearth.\n\nThen, based on test scores and CV, students were shortlisted for the interview.\n\nIt was about a 75\u201390 min elaborate interview, divided into 3 segments. The 1st section is more like a CV round which involved deep discussion of projects and internships that dealt with data and programming, and in between, related technical questions were also asked. The 2nd section is a coding round. A problem related to arrays was asked which was of moderate-hard level. In the 3rd section, some guesstimates, logical puzzles, and questions related to probability, statistics, permutations and combinations were asked.\n\nHow to prepare for them?\n\nRound 1 test- For aptitude and puzzles, you can use practice questions from Geeks for Geeks, Quantitative Aptitude, LR/DI by Arun Sharma, or any other good resource which covers almost all kinds of topics and problems, along with brushing up on Probability and Statistics courses. Taking time-based aptitude tests also helps. Practice and time management is the only key.\n\nMedium and hard puzzles on Brainstellar, Heard on the Street, 50 Challenging Problems in Probability, and Xinfeng Zhou are other good resources. Questions were like watered-down versions of CAT questions. You should Practice CAT/GMAT questions for quant. There were also abstract figure-type questions. For coding MCQs, basic data structures and algorithms should be revised.\n\nRound 2 test- For coding questions, I just practiced all example problems from Geeks for Geeks and questions from Hackerrank (as it has a similar interface to almost all coding tests), since I was short of time. Interviewbit is also a good option. Previous year questions and company-wise questions might also give you a better idea. You can also practice coding questions on Leetcode with a focus on medium-difficulty questions.\n\nInterview- Know your CV well. Prepare puzzles from popular sites like geeksforgeeks, besides others. I was asked 2 basic coding questions, so practice solving a coding question in an interview setting, i.e. solving a question while explaining your thought process.\n\nWhat difficulties did you face while preparing for this Company/Profile? How did you overcome this problem?\n\nA problem which I faced, not specifically for this company, but the whole process in general is that due to the process being conducted online, the companies\u2019 test schedules were quite hectic once the interviews had started. Also, just staring at computer screen for the whole time can be somewhat depressing.\n\nAccording to you, who should ideally apply for this job?\n\nTiger analytics has services/projects both in the space of ML/AI and Analytics. I came to know from a senior working there, that there are options for a new hire to work in both analytics stuff(dashboarding/generating insights and reports) or in ML/AI projects. Anyone who has an interest in data science, math, coding, and problem-solving can consider this job. Given that the company has business in multiple verticals, lateral shifts in the job should also be possible.\n\nAny specific advice you want to give to the junta sitting for placements this year?\n\nIf possible, try to take easy and less work-loaded courses and electives in your placement semester, in case you\u2019re flexible with your choices.\n\nDo not indulge yourself in several resources. Choose some wisely and be consistent.\n\nStay calm and focused. Surely you\u2019ll do better.\n\nThe placement season can be really frustrating and nerve-wracking at times. Even more so during the online scenario, when you are probably holed up in your home, with little interaction with your friends. It is imperative that you don\u2019t lose your confidence after interview/test rejections. It is very important that you retain your confidence and not go for any role which might come your way but is not your interest. Also, practice giving interviews with your friends to get habituated with the feeling for when the actual thing comes. Even if you aren\u2019t placed with the first few days, don\u2019t be hopeless. You\u2019ll eventually get placed."

I like to solve puzzles and every day I solve at least one sudoku.\n\nHow did you get into APT Portfolio? What was the selection procedure?\n\nFirstly, I would like to thank everyone who helped and motivated me during the placement drive and also a special mention to the APT portfolio for recruiting me. I got selected for the Data Scientist role which I aimed for. First, there was an online test that consists of competitive coding questions which are of a moderate level in which I did all the questions and followed by two rounds of coding interviews each of duration of around 45 minutes where they mainly focussed on trees, stacks and in each round, they asked 4\u20135 questions which we need to code in hackerrank platform. Generally, every company follows the same procedure for selection which is mentioned above, there will be an additional HR round at the last for most of the companies.\n\nHow to prepare for them?\n\nI started my preparation in December 2019 i.e., when I learned python and the basics of Machine Learning and did projects and internships in the summers (2020 and 2021) which helped me a lot in learning AI-related concepts in depth. Apart from my work experience, I prepared for competitive coding questions from InterviewBit and LeetCode during the internship and placement drive which is sufficient and must for anyone who is willing to give cp related tests which not just helped me in placement tests but also helped me in improving my thinking skills so I would recommend everyone not to neglect competitive programming especially if you are aiming for such roles.\n\nAccording to you, who should ideally apply for this job?\n\nThe one who is interested in Mathematics, Coding and has experience in Data Science is perfectly suited for this role. Apart from these, there are plenty of soft skills which are important such as communication, problem-solving, thinking skills and many more.\n\nAny specific advice you want to give to the junta sitting for placements this year?\n\nBe confident, prepare well, aim for roles in which you are not just interested but also had a belief that you can do justice for such roles. Don\u2019t get tensed about placement tests which will be hundreds in number, just be prepared and learn from your mistakes try to give your best in each and every test. Discuss with your friends who are also aiming for similar roles as the exchange of thoughts always helps you to grow better. During Interviews as most of them will happen at night till day 3 try to sleep whenever you get some free time. Do not get demotivated if you are not selected by a company stay motivated and be confident, you will definitely get selected if you believe in yourself.All the best to everyone who are going to sit for placements this year."

        "info": "Even for the data science profile, there would be an initial coding round to shortlist students.",
        "content": "FORESIGHT(2022): Placement at Rakuten Mobile Inc. | Saikat Mandol\n\nBrief Introduction\n\nHello everyone; my name is Saikat Mandol. I am a fourth-year undergraduate student of the Department of Electronics and Electrical Communication Engineering enrolled in its B.Tech course. I am a boarder of Lal Bahadur Shastri Hall of Residence. I am from Kolkata, and my hobbies are cycling, playing football, and listening to music. I have been placed at Rakuten Mobile Inc. during the CDC placement session 2021\u20132022, and this is my last semester at IIT Kharagpur.\n\nHow did you get into Rakuten Mobile? What was the selection procedure?\n\nThe CDC placement process starts with the registration and initiation of the CV portal (in the CDC tab of ERP) post-Durga Puja in early October. Students are given around two weeks to create and edit their CVs with which they would apply for various companies. Once the CV portal closes, the companies start coming for CDC or accept student applications (through CV application, company portal use, etc., and sometimes a combination of more than one application procedure). Rakuten Mobile is given a slot preferably on Day 1 or Day 2 (this time, they were given a slot on Day 2, implying they would hold the final selection interviews for shortlisted students on December 2 and select the students on the same day; Day 1 begins on December 1). Since the company comes quite early in the interview process, they start their student application process quite early, too (expect them to go for a CV application just after the CV portal closes). Through the initial screening round (internal company selection), the shortlisted students will get a link for further online exam rounds. The online exam consists of quite a few MCQs in the first section, followed by a coding team consisting of two coding questions. The exam is conducted on a Japanese platform (not in Hackerrank, HackerEarth, Mettle, etc., generally used for tests in maximum companies). Their platform has English as the mode of communication. Once the students qualify for the online exam rounds, they will be shortlisted for the final interview round. The interview round consists of 2 rounds and is held on Zoom. The first round is a Technical round, and crossing it would lead you to the final round, the HR round. Finally, after clearing all these exams and rounds of interviews, if the performance is good enough, they will roll out the offer for you, which one needs to confirm their choice (accept or reject) compulsorily by the end of the day.\n\nNOTE: This is the general procedure common to the companies, with only the number of shortlisting exams and interview rounds being a variable from company to company.\n\nHow to prepare for them?\n\nRakuten Mobile comes for the profile of Software Engineer, which consists of the following sub-divisions:\n\nSo, the online exam is structured in such a way that it touches all the topics at a level that can be easily solved by students currently pursuing undergraduate engineering degrees. Nonetheless, you need good domain knowledge of the field you have been preparing for, which will take care of the MCQ section. MCQ section can have questions regarding associated concepts, code snippets output, general knowledge about relevant technology and IQ, and reasoning-based questions. Though there will be a lot of MCQs, sufficient time will be provided. For the coding section, you need to be well-versed in Data Structures and Algorithms , not to mention you should practice coding regularly. The coding questions have an easy to moderate difficulty level and can be easily cracked if one is diligent in practice. TIP: Always try to complete the test 100% correctly as quickly as possible. With a large number of people giving the exam, your submission time decides if you are getting shortlisted or not.\n\nMy profile was that of Data Science (it is very important to remember that even for the data science profile, there would be an initial coding round to shortlist students for interviews). So, to sit for this role, it is very necessary that one has Machine Learning concepts clear to the very basics, has experience in Python programming at the least, and not to mention a good grasp of maths and statistics. The students would be required to take up some online data science courses to build up their knowledge from scratch and do at least two projects to gain working experience. One alsohas to necessarily do at least one internship in data science, artificial intelligence, or ML roles to get industry and corporate experience to know the ins and outs of what a data scientist must do daily. Every bit of experience counts when one is applying for data science roles. This will count a lot during the interview processes of Rakuten Mobile.\n\nStudents are also advised to prepare for the HR round. Being a Japanese company, they will look towards a student\u2019s interest in learning the language and relocating to Japan. They will also appreciate it if you have researched a bit about the company and are aware of Japanese culture and customs. This round is about projecting your interests towards the company and giving them a sense of assurance that their goals match yours. They are very eager to answer questions about the company and its various professional aspects, and also they will happily take up questions regarding Japan. Try to remain disciplined and courteous in how you speak and behave with the interviewers; that goes a long way in making a solid impression. Students might also want to brush up on generic online HR questions.\n\nHow would you describe the work culture in your company? How is thework-life balance?\n\nI am still a student at IIT Kharagpur until the end of April and will join the company on 1st October 2022. So, I do not have sufficient information regarding the same. I would request the students check online reviews from websites like Glassdoor.\n\nHow was your experience working from home? What difficulties did you face?\n\nLet me start by mentioning that I secured a CDC internship at Persistent Systems, a product-based company based out of Pune. This was during the pandemic, so my internship was working from home. The cons of working from home outweigh the pros, in my opinion. The very purpose of training is to give the students a corporate experience before the actual placements, and the fact that we have had to work from home defeats the whole purpose. At the same time, it is true that in an online mode of internship, you are not required to be present and available at all times, with briefing meetings taking place once or twice daily, giving you more time to complete the designated tasks. However, this also means that your managers and mentors in the internship would not be available most of the time to clear your doubts. So, I would not say I have had the most incredible experience working from home, and I would recommend anyone else to opt for the onsite experience. However, it should be noted that it is not a discredit to the company. I was involved in a very industry-relevant project with massive future implications, and I was glad I could contribute to that project.\n\nAccording to you, who should ideally apply for this job?\n\nGiven below is the extent of operations of Rakuten Group, Inc.\n\nI should give a short description of Rakuten Mobile Inc. as a company. Founded in 2018, it is a Rakuten Group (established in 1997) company responsible for mobile communications, including mobile network operator (MNO) and mobile virtual network operator (MVNO) businesses, as well as ICT and energy. Through continuous innovation and the deployment of advanced technology, Rakuten Mobile aims to redefine expectations in the mobile communications industry to provide appealing and convenient services that respond to diverse customer needs. They entered the mobile carrier business in 2019 as the fourth carrier in Japan and are a global leader, provider, and innovator of mobile technology and communications platforms, transforming the industry by launching the world\u2019s first end-to-end cloud-native mobile network.\n\nSo, anyone aligning with the aims mentioned above and ambitions should look forward to joining this company. In a previous image, I described the roles available under Software Engineer roles and their descriptions. Students who have been preparing dedicatedly for Software and Data Science roles should actively seek to join this company, and students from both core Electronics and Electrical Engineering backgrounds. However, it should be mentioned that while the company opens for all departments, recent history suggests that it selects only circuital department (CSE, E&ECE, EE, MNC) students after the final round. Apart from the professional aspect, I should mention the extra incentives I know many students would be interested in. The CTC offered (I am not at liberty to discuss the figures) is highly competitive for undergraduate freshers with well-structured career development opportunities. I think I have also not yet mentioned that they recruit for their Tokyo office in Japan (if it is not the greatest motivation to join the company, then I do not know what is). So, people who admire Japanese culture, be it their language, anime, food, etc., should look forward to applying to this company. Also, do not forget that Rakuten sponsors FC Barcelona and VIssel Kobe, where Andreas Iniesta still plays football. So they have highly globalized their operations in recent years.\n\nAny specific advice you want to give to the junta sitting for placements this year?\n\nFirst of all, I would like to take this opportunity to thank the CDC Placement Committee members for their selfless and untiring efforts behind the scenes to ensure a seamless and successful internship and placement process. Students must remain in touch with 3 to 4 PlaceComms throughout the process. That would help them clarify their issues and doubts about the process rather than relying upon incorrect or semi-correct information obtained from peers. Your first point of contact should be PlaceComm(s) from your hall of residence, and if not available, any other PlaceComm will do too.\n\nI have seen many people ease up after they get an internship. But work should not stop there. The students should actively learn before, during, and after their internship. Preparation for placements should be continuous and dedicated, spread over a long time. Do not leave any bits while preparing and cover all relevant topics for placements.\n\nStudents should never lie in their CVs and interviews. This statement is relatively self-explanatory. CDC asks for proof of involvement regarding everything mentioned in the CV. A red flag in this stage of scrutiny can lead to unwanted problems for the student. Always be thorough with the contents in your CV and be prepared to take extensive questions on their specifics during the interviews.\n\nBefore giving exams and interviews, students are advised to have sufficient food and rest, and they should be energized enough to tackle 3-hour continuous sessions. CDC processes are very uncertain regarding how the shortlists are generated, what evaluation criteria the company has decided amongst themselves, and the final results. So, students are advised to accept that they will undoubtedly face rejection along the way. The task of paramount importance is to get over the rejections and disappointments and shift your attention to the next exam or interview.Also, remember that CDC internship performance does not positively correlate with CDC placement performance. One might perform unsatisfactorily during the internship and do quite well in the placement process (like me).\n\nIt is very important to realize that your CGPA plays a significant role in CDC processes; hence, one should never undermine the advantage a good CGPA brings to the table. Also, people tend to forget that off-campus presents many opportunities. It is a gold mine if you are thinking about exploring that. One advantage which CDC gives over off-campus processes is that it is quick, reliable, secure, and provides comparatively better compensation.\n\nJealousy kills a person slowly from the inside. However, it is virtually impossible not to be jealous of your peers around you based on their placements. I would only mention that being in an IIT has already given us an advantage and privilege over other institutes across India based on future career prospects. Understand the importance of it and remember that you might progress higher than a peer you were jealous of in the future. So soak in the experiences, enjoy the journey, and all the best for the upcoming internships and placements. KGPians have historically always been successful in the face of adversity, and as your senior, I know you will too.\n\nYO KGP! Peace!"

        "content": "FORESIGHT (2021) |Post Graduate Engineer Trainee researcher at Mercedes Benz| Anuraag Bhattacharya\n\nBrief Introduction:\n\nI graduated from IIT KGP in 2021 with a Dual Degree in Electrical Engineering (specialization in Instrumentation and Signal Processing). I got placed in Mercedes Benz Research and Development India during the placement season of 2020\u201321 and joined the company as a Post Graduate Engineer Trainee (AI/ML) in MBRDI\u2019s Intelligent Interior (Algorithm) team from August 2021.\n\nHow did you get into Mercedes Benz? What was the selection procedure?\n\nThe company conducted an online coding test, on the basis of which they prepared the shortlist for the interview round. The interview was almost an hour-long, with 5 different people interviewing me one by one. The questions were mainly focused on machine learning and deep learning concepts, and also a fair bit on the internships that I had done. I was also asked questions from computer vision as I had a fair bit of background in the same, and I was not prepared for the same as computer vision concepts were not something that I had revised specifically for CDC interviews. Fortunately, I was able to tackle most of the questions on that topic. I got selected based on my performance in the interview.\n\nHow to prepare for them?\n\nLike many of my peers who were preparing for software/ML roles, I spent most of my time preparing for coding tests in popular programming platforms such as Interview Bit, LeetCode etc. I also prepared for machine learning/deep learning questions from various sources (course material and various online sources). However, as ML/DL roles are limited in number as far as CDC placements are concerned compared to SWE roles, I devoted most of my preparation time to Data Structures and Algorithms. Prior to interviews, I focused mostly on topics that I was most proficient in. It is also important to be prepared for questions focused on projects/internships mentioned in the CV.\n\nHow would you describe the work culture in your company? How is the work-life balance?\n\nI was very impressed by the work culture in MBRDI. Since the team that I work in is focused mostly on the R&D side of things, we generally don\u2019t have daily deadline pressure. The work-life balance is ideal. We get enough time for our own selves during weekdays and have the whole weekend off. We also get considerable liberty to explore and carry out research in topics and problems that interest us. Apart from that, we receive a lot of support, guidance and help from our fellow teammates and seniors, which makes work a lot more enjoyable. I consider myself very lucky to be a part of this wonderful company.\n\nHow was your experience working from home? What difficulties did you face?\n\nAccording to you, who should ideally apply for this job?\n\nIdeally, people who are fairly proficient in Data Structures and Algorithms and are interested to work in the field of ML/DL and have some kind of background in the same (in the form of courses, projects, internships, etc.) should apply for this job. Last year, the position was offered only to students having/pursuing a masters.\n\nAny specific advice you want to give to the junta sitting for placements this year?\n\nDo your preparation wisely. If you are someone who is targeting SWE roles as well as ML/DL roles, make sure to spend most of your time preparing Data Structures and Algorithms, as that will come in handy in most of your interviews. I would not encourage anyone to focus solely on ML/DL roles, as only a handful of companies offer the same. Stay confident, stay focused and don\u2019t lose hope if you face a few rejections at the beginning, rest assured your time will come eventually, and it is important that you keep your composure till the end. A lot also depends on luck, so don\u2019t be hard on yourself if you see your peers getting placed before you do. After all, days 1,2,3 are just numbers \ud83d\ude0a All the best to everyone sitting for placements this year! Do not worry, something wonderful is waiting for you on the other side.\n\nOfficial CV is attached in a image format."
