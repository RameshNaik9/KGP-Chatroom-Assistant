        "content": "FORESIGHT(2022): Placement at Morgan Stanley | Compilation\n\nBrief Introduction\n\nHow did you get into MORGAN STANLEY? What was the selection procedure?\n\nTalking about Morgan Stanley specifically, at first, an online test was conducted for all the students who applied for the role. This online test included general and quantitative aptitude questions, 2 coding questions (easy to moderate level), and an SVAR test which is a spoken English assessment, and after getting shortlisted the interview round was conducted. The interview lasted for four rounds including 3 rounds which lasted for about 45\u201360 minutes, and a final HR round.\n\nThe first two rounds were more technical in nature than the last two.\n\nThe first round of interviews was a completely finance-based interview where I was asked a lot of questions about my past interns and projects. These questions primarily focused on the understanding of various finance jargon and a thorough understanding of Derivatives and their uses. A few puzzles and prob-stats questions were also asked during the first round\n\nThe second round lasted around an hour. The interview was predominantly focused towards my trading strategies and practices in the Indian equity market which was mentioned by me in my intro itself. The latter half of the interview was on DSA where a few coding questions were asked to check the candidate\u2019s coding acumen. In my case, I was also given a guesstimate in the end as well.\n\nThe third and fourth rounds were primarily HR rounds with each round lasting around 20\u201325 minutes.\n\nHow to prepare for them?\n\n2. Finance \u2014 JC Hull (must read for derivations and proofs), be thorough with all the relevant details in your CV \u2014 interns, projects, coursework, etc. Do start reading a business paper daily at least a month before the interviews to get updated with the latest market news and trends.\n\n3. Coding \u2014 Interviewbit would suffice. Can practice weak topics from Leetcode as well.\n\n4. Guesstimates \u2014 It is always beneficial to practice some cases and guesstimates before sitting for your placements irrespective of your profile. A lot of IIM casebooks have a good set of guesstimates, to begin with. If you are just starting with guesstimates, you can check books like Day One and Case Interviews Cracked.\n\n5. Quant \u2014 Must do \u2014 Xinfeng Zhou, Heard on the Street, 50 Challenging problems in probability. If time persists, you can check out GFG puzzles and Brainstellar.com as well.\n\n6. For the online test, you don\u2019t need to do something out of the box. For interview purposes, you should prepare/revise basic probability and statistics. Solve a good number of puzzles. Just practice a lot of coding questions, solve some quantitative aptitude questions and that\u2019s it. Prepare your project (the topic really doesn\u2019t matter much but you should know what you\u2019ve done and you have to present it nicely and confidently).\n\n7. Easy to moderate coding questions are enough for the interview but start with brute force and gradually think of better solutions. The most important thing is your thought process and how you are explaining your solution to the interviewer.\n\n8. In the HR round just be yourself and be confident. All the interviewers were really friendly and there is absolutely no need to get nervous. Even if you get stuck on some question they will give you hints and try to help you as much as possible.\n\nAccording to you, who should ideally apply for this job?\n\nAny specific advice you want to give to the junta sitting for placements this year?"

        "content": "FORESIGHT(2022): Placement at OLA | Compilation\n\n1) Brief Introduction\n\nMy name is Shikhar Goel. I am currently pursuing M. Tech from IIT Kgp in Thermal Science and Engineering Specialization(ME). I am working on a project with INTEL Co. Ltd which is based on laptop cooling. Apart from that, I have done several projects in CFD. Talking about my achievements I secured AIR 484 in GATE 2021 (ME).\n\nI am Somesh Shrivastava, 2nd-year M.Tech student of Electrical Engineering department under Control Systems Engineering specialization (2020\u201322 Batch), got placed with OLA Electric during the placement phase-I (December 2021).\n\n2) How did you get into Ola? What was the selection procedure?\n\nThe selection process was basically a two round process (as it is case for most of the companies), a written test and interview.\n\nThe written test was held online via an exam portal and it was a mix of technical and aptitude questions. Questions were objective type and easy to medium level, UG level questions.The short listing for technical interviews is based on the performance in the written test as well as the resume. Once the written round was cleared then one would be called for the interview round.\n\nInterview was also online and consisted of two rounds, technical round & HR round. Technical round was mostly about one \u2019s project work and theoretical background related to the project. Technical questions were from those subjects which were related to the project, while the HR round was all about one\u2019s social, professional and soft skills.\n\nFor the HR round, try to be calm and polite instead of being nervous . Also, try to make it interesting. These kinds of questions are asked in the HR round: What do you know about the company; Can you adapt to the company\u2019s environment; What do you know about the profile, etc.\n\n3) How to prepare for them?\n\nPreparing for aptitude and basic Electrical subjects would be enough for the written test, but aptitude needs to be practiced regularly and one should start it well before as it is the easiest part but requires time and dedication to attain speed and perfection. Preparation up to GATE and ESE level is sufficient as most of the questions are GATE or ESE PYQs.\n\nFor the technical interview, focus on projects and internships. Preparing one\u2019s project is the most important thing. Know your project well, what was the aim, what was done in the project, how things were done and the theoretical knowledge of each and every subject which was involved in the project work, going through the subjects at least once would be good. U must be well aware of all that has been written in your resume.\n\nHR round is just about oneself and one should practice how to frame answers well according to the situation. This is not an easy thing, but with\n\nenough practice one can definitely express oneself well in front of the interviewer. Many online sources provide such information for free like youtube, various blogs and articles etc. Just surf the internet once and one can easily get some good and well detailed sources.\n\n4) What all difficulties did you face while preparing for this Company/Profile? How did you overcome this problem?\n\nOne major difficulty many of the students face is where to prepare from, I started to prepare from UG level books, but after giving few tests I realized books were too much for the tests and such detailed theory is not required for the tests. One can find some website which have good objective type questions particularly whose level is same as the written tests. Also preparing for GATE level 1 mark questions from any test series of previous year question papers should be enough.\n\nAlso for HR round, youtube would be the best option (in case you do not have any subscription of inverview preparation courses).\n\n5) According to you, who should ideally apply for this job?\n\nPeople who are interested in working for core Electrical company or people who are interested in working for startups (as startups give challenging environment) can apply for this job.\n\n6) Any specific advice you want to give to the junta sitting for placements this year.\n\nGo for roles you are really interested in, do not fall for high salaries or what others are going for. Spending one\u2019s time and energy on a field which one is not well aware of and just started preparing a few months before the\n\nplacements just because the field is in trend would mostly result in a waste of time and energy. Better to prepare for roles you are confident about and about which you are sure you can fruitfully dedicate yourself into. Prepare aptitude well and practice regularly well before the placement starts, prepare the theory of subjects of the field you are interested in. Don\u2019t worry about interview from start of your preparation, just focus on doing well in the test first. If you find that you are getting enough time then prepare for interview and try to give some mock interviews.\n\nFor tests focus both on your technical and aptitude part. For interviews you can refer to youtube, there is a ton of good content just be confident in the interviews. If you don\u2019t have too many things on your resume then try to highlight the best things on your resume in your introduction."

        "content": "FORESIGHT(2022): Placement at Eaton | Compilation\n\nBrief Introduction\n\nI am Saksham Kumar, an M.Tech final year student of mechanical systems design (department of mechanical engineering) at IIT Kharagpur. I have done my B.Tech in mechanical engineering from IIT Patna. I have received a job offer from Eaton Technologies Private Limited through campus placements at IIT Kharagpur.\n\nI am Rahul Agrawal currently pursuing my Master\u2019s in Mechanical System Design in the Department of Mechanical Engineering at IITKGP. I did my BTech from Pune University and graduated in 2019 from there and then joined IITKGP for a master\u2019s program in 2020 and I have received an offer from Eaton Technologies Private Limited.\n\nI\u2019m Shuvoshree Bhattacharya from the Department of Electrical Engineering. I have done my MS (by research) under Dr. Ashis Maity and Prof. Amit Patra. My broad area of research was Power management in IC. I got an offer from EATON (role- Eaton technical leadership programme) during the last placement season (2021\u201322).\n\nMy name is Saurabh Prakash and I\u2019m pursuing my post-graduation in Electrical Engineering with machine Drives and Power Electronics as my specialization(2020\u201322) at IIT Kharagpur. I am placed in EATON and my profile is ETLP(Eaton technical leadership programme).\n\nHow did you get into Eaton? What was the selection procedure?\n\nEATON is a core mechanical company and they shortlisted students based on their CVs.\n\nThe shortlisted students were then called in for technical interviews. The technical interview went on for almost 45 minutes where initially I was asked basic questions from Vibrations. After the initial 5\u201310 minutes, for the next 10 minutes the interviewer asked questions completely on my MTP (he seemed interested in that). After that my algorithmic thinking was checked by giving me a problem statement and asking me to write a pseudo code for it. The later part of my interview was based on some basic questions from other subjects like Mechanics of Material, Finite Element Methods, Engineering Mechanics, etc.\n\nSome of the students were then shortlisted for the HR interview from the technical interview. In the HR interview, the questions asked were Introduce Yourself? Why EATON? Have you ever had to make a compromise with your principles? How did you manage to do it? What was the biggest challenge that you faced in your projects? What did you learn from it? The interviewer asked HR questions for about 20 minutes.\n\nHow to prepare for them?\n\nThe best key to preparing for any core company is to make sure our basics are clear. The shortlisting for the interviews was done based on submitted CVs. Therefore, it is advised that the students targeting these jobs should have a strong CV. They should devote ample amounts of time to writing as well as polishing their CVs.The students should be fully aware of whatever they have written in their CVs and they should be ready to answer any question related to them. Getting their CVs evaluated by some seniors who are experts in the field is also a good idea. Many core companies take written tests as their first round to shortlist for interviews. So, students targeting such roles should revise important technical subjects taught in B.Tech as well as the various topics of aptitude. Apart from this, they should practice important HR questions. Some practice for speaking good English is also preferable.\n\nWhat difficulties did you face while preparing for this Company/Profile? How did you overcome this problem?\n\nIt was mostly related to projects and resumes. You should do your project with utmost sincerity that will suffice the purpose. The only thing is that you should relate everything that you say in the interview to real and practical scenarios. I think any core company will look for candidates having sound fundamentals and having good command in 2\u20133 subjects. To overcome this problem, I utilized a few books which are related to GATE preparation. Many such books contain the theory of subjects in a brief manner through which we can revise important stuff. Such books are also very helpful for practicing numerical questions. The questions asked in the written tests of core companies are generally on the easier side of the GATE-level questions.\n\nAccording to you, who should ideally apply for this job?\n\nThe one who is inclined towards the core job in Electrical and Mechanical Engineering Students who are very much interested in core jobs and looking for a long-term career in mechanical engineering should apply for this job. EATON is a very good company to start your career with due to its working culture and the projects it takes. Those who like the area of machine learning and data analysis would also like the role. Data analysis is nowadays used a lot in many core companies too.\n\nI wish all the very best to everyone sitting for this year\u2019s placement.\n\nAny specific advice you want to give to the junta sitting for placements this year?\n\nPlacement season is exhausting, both mentally and physically. Just keep faith in yourself, start working from the beginning and keep your basics clear. The most important thing, be confident. And try to explain anything like you are explaining to a layman (of course by using some engineering terminology), in simple terms, that reflect your understanding of the concept. The placement phase is a time when it is important to maintain your cool and not get very affected if you are not getting the desired outcomes. During this time, your focus should be to appear in as many interviews as you can irrespective of past results. Please do not let the result of one interview/written exam affect the result of another. You should not take any rejection personally and focus on playing the game. I wish all the very best to everyone sitting for this year\u2019s placement. Something good is waiting for all of you."

I finished my B.tech from Mahatma Gandhi Institute of Technology as an Electronics and Communications Engineer in the year 2019. In my second attempt at GATE, I secured a rank of 859 in GATE 2020 EC and opted for Rf and Microwave Engineering at IIT Kharagpur.\n\nHow did you get into Texas Instruments? What was the selection procedure?\n\nTexas Instruments came for hiring through the on-campus CDC process for various domains such as software, hardware analog and digital. The hiring process involved an online test for shortlisting candidates and a 2 step interview that was held late at night. The first interview was for 90 to 100 minutes and the second interview took 45 minutes. The first interview was mostly based on the basics of digital circuits and questions of Verilog HDL, followed by an aptitude question in the end. The second interview was much harder than the first as it included concepts from both analog and digital design even though the job profile is of a digital engineer\n\nHow to prepare for them?\n\nWe guys from Rf and Microwave usually prepare for job profiles involving RFIC and VLSI (analog and digital). Most of us including myself have made use of NPTEL videos, Professor recommended textbooks, previous year\u2019s online test papers and also made note of topics from the interview experiences of our seniors. Apart from this, many students usually approach private online coaching to clear a few concepts but I didn\u2019t find it necessary. I mainly followed my class notes, tips and sources from my seniors, NPTEL videos and previous papers for both profiles.\n\nFor this domain, I would recommend Design of Analog CMOS Integrated Circuits by Behzad Razavi, NPTEL Digital Circuits by Prof.S.Srinivasan, NPTEL Hardware modeling using Verilog by Indranil Sen Gupta\n\nAccording to you, who should ideally apply for this job?\n\nAnyone who is passionate about VLSI design either analog or digital, who is capable of working a little bit harder to prepare for the interview, online test and beyond after joining and of course a little street smartness and aptitude is required\n\nAny specific advice you want to give to the junta sitting for placements this year?\n\nMy advice is to not think of the interview result or about the selection process while preparing for it. Try not to be anxious, days before the selection process. Keep your mind calm and peaceful because worrying about the job doesn\u2019t help you fetch the job. Try to help your friends in clarifying doubts and take help from them, be patient, be nice to people and maintain a positive atmosphere around you. At the end of the day it is always you vs you..so always try to do better than what you are doing today and one day when you will look back it will all make sense and you will know what I am talking about\n\nMy Best Wishes\u2026"

I am a boarder of Lal Bahadur Shastri Hall of Residence. I got the placement offer from Bajaj Auto during the current placement season as a Post Graduate Trainee Engineer.\n\nHow did you get into Bajaj auto? What was the selection procedure?\n\nDespite being from Aerospace, most of my projects had an overlap with Mechanical subjects, and hence before the placement season started I decided to apply to core mechanical roles. As a backup, I was also preparing for business analyst roles.\n\nRegarding the selection process, most of the core companies in Mechanical have a screening test \u2014 Aptitude followed by Core Subject Questions. 30 min after the first written round, qualified students were sent another link to take the Psychometric Assessment. There are no wrong or right answers in this section and I believe only the consistency of answers will be checked.\n\nIn the interview, I was expecting technical questions related to vehicles and was not so confident as I had no experience. But luckily the interview was mostly based on my CV. Every small detail about the project was asked and I had to explain it to them in detail. They first asked me to describe my favorite project and its relevance in the current industry. Later minor details about all the projects were asked. They basically wanted to know how well I understood the projects and whether I have done the project myself.\n\nThe next round of interviews was the HR round, which lasted for roughly 5 minutes where they just asked for basic details and they wanted to know why I am not preferring higher studies despite having a good CGPA.\n\nHow to prepare for them?\n\nThe syllabus of the written test is the same as the syllabus for GATE Mechanical, but the focus will be more on 5 topics namely \u2014 Thermodynamics, Strength Of Materials, Machine Design, Fluid Dynamics, and IC Engines. These 5 topics would be enough to crack the exam. Some Aptitude questions were also asked and students are expected to be well-versed in aptitude as almost all job profiles test this aspect.\n\nFor the interview, just be very well-versed with your CV and don\u2019t mention anything that you can\u2019t justify. Prepare a good introduction and also be ready with questions that you will ask the interviewer after the interview. Both the introduction and the conclusion are essential as they paint a good impression. Be confident in your answers and everything will be fine.\n\nWhat difficulties did you face while preparing for this Company/Profile? How did you overcome this problem?\n\nBeing from Aerospace, I didn\u2019t have the knowledge regarding some Mechanical Gate concepts and I spent most of the Dusshera Holidays reading these topics and writing practice tests. Some of the questions will be direct formula based and one has to remember a lot of formulas and equations. Apart from that, I had doubts and fear regarding the placements but I was lucky to have good friends and family who constantly believed in me and motivated me to stay confident.\n\nAccording to you, who should ideally apply for this job?\n\nAnyone interested in the profile and having a profile something close to the job profile can apply. For Bajaj Auto, there is no need to have any prior knowledge about the working of a motor vehicle as was the case with me. I am not sure about the CGPA factor, but having a good CGPA definitely helps in core profiles.\n\nAny specific advice you want to give to the junta sitting for placements this year?\n\nIt\u2019s never too late to get started as I myself started preparing for the placements during the DP Holidays. Just put in the required effort and be confident in your abilities and skills. Don\u2019t be scared about the interview as you are not expected to know everything. And most importantly keep in touch with close friends and family, who will help you stay focused."

I\u2019m a final year undergraduate from the Department of Mechanical Engineering enrolled in its B.Tech course of Manufacturing Science and Engineering. Recently, I got a placement offer from ICICI Bank for a Management Trainee profile.\n\nHow did you get into ICICI Bank? What was the selection procedure?\n\nI was selected by ICICI Bank through phase-I of campus placements 2021\u201322. It was open to all the departments.\n\nThe selection procedure consisted of an online shortlisting test and one technical interview round, no HR round.\n\nThe online test has MCQs on Aptitude, ML, Object-Oriented Programming, Operating Systems, Networking, and other computer science topics. It was around an hour-long online proctored test.\n\nThe interview lasted for about 40\u201345 minutes. After my introduction, I was asked questions from my CV. I was asked to explain one of the data analytics competitions mentioned in my CV. After giving a thorough explanation, I was asked technical questions related to my approach to the problem along with some questions related to the deployed ML algorithms. The interviewer tried to tweak the problem a bit and asked about the difference in my approach compared to the previous one. It was an interactive interview. The interviewer also gave me some insights into the problems they deal with.\n\nHow to prepare for them?\n\nI would suggest having basic knowledge of Machine Learning and Data Analytics. One should have absolute clarity about each and everything mentioned in the CV. Apart from this, one should have a grip over Data Structures Algorithms and OOP. Last but not the least, one should be able to convey their thoughts to the interviewer in a presentable and clear fashion.\n\nWhat difficulties did you face while preparing for this Company/Profile? How did you overcome this problem?\n\nOne thing which I realized at the time I was looking for an internship was, that even if you are preparing for non-SDE roles still you should have some grip over DSA and other CSE topics. This opens a wide spectrum of opportunities. Even if you are targeting for Data/ML profile, you should not be surprised by the coding and OOP questions in online tests. So, for the placements, apart from brushing the ML concepts and going through my projects and internships, I focused on practicing coding and learning basic OOP concepts. This will not only be a skill addition but coding will help you to think in an organized manner and approach a problem in a much better way.\n\nAccording to you, who should ideally apply for this job?\n\nAnyone interested in machine learning, mathematics, and playing with data should apply for this job.\n\nAny specific advice you want to give to the junta sitting for placements this year?\n\nThe placement process is the testing time of your KGP journey. It is a very draining and mentally demanding process. There are lots of companies visiting for different profiles. One should not go on blindly applying to every company. Rather, be clear about what you expect out of this placement process, and also keeping in mind your level of preparation, apply for the companies accordingly. Be patient and keep on trying. You may feel at a point in time that everything is going against you but that is the time when you have to keep your motivation intact and stick around. Keep interacting with your friends and help each other.\n\nAll the Best!!"

I did my B.tech in Jawaharlal Nehru Technological University; Anantapur specialized in mechanical engineering with an aggregate of 8.49 cgpa. My schooling and intermediate went in Tirupati itself which is my native place. In SSC, I secured 9.8 GPA and in intermediate, I secured 97.5 %. I have done my B.tech project on friction stir welding which is a unique way of welding technique that improves the fatigue strength of the material compared to other usual welding processes. I did an internship in the Visakhapatnam steel plant in the sector of raw material handling plant. In addition to the sector which has been assigned to me, I have also visited other sectors of the plant where I came to know what all the various processes involved in the making of steel and how exactly steel is manufactured. Currently I am doing my m.tech project on data analytics for fault diagnosis. Using this project we can predict fault in any machine beforehand and can reduce losses to the company. My hobbies are playing chess, listening music and writing fantasy stories.\n\nHow did you get into LAM Research? What was the selection procedure?\n\nThe company has selected candidates through a Resume shortlisting. That resume shortlisting is based on my projects and skill set (Catia, Creo).\n\nThe interview procedure has two rounds\n\nIn the technical round, they completely focused on my B.tech and m.tech projects. They asked me all the possible questions in my projects and some mechanical core-related questions.\n\nIn HR round they will test you on whether you are greedy towards money or greedy towards skills. They need the guys who are ready to opt for new technologies and new concepts instead of the guys who are greedy for money. They will put you in some situations and ask you how you will handle that situations. For example, they asked me what if a new challenge has been given to you which is completely new to you but we need very good output from you, how can you match up our expected output. Like this, they will put you in some situations and test your approach toward the solution.\n\nHow to prepare for them?\n\nYou have to be clear about your projects and you should be able to explain your projects in such a way even a layman can understand what you have done.\n\nBe particular about the results of your project, and note down what results you got in your projects, is there any unique thing you added or obtained using your project. For example in my case, in my B.tech project we proved that friction stir welded products are having high strength compared to other welding processes.\n\nAlso be thorough with your B.tech core subjects.\n\nWhat difficulties did you face while preparing for this Company/Profile? How did you overcome this problem?\n\nThe only problem everyone faces is fear. Not only LAM Research but any company does not ask difficult questions. They just ask basic questions about the project and our core subjects. Due to fear or interview pressure, you may tend to forget what you have known and cannot present yourself properly. I reminded myself that they are not aliens and just humans. In my case, I went with the mindset that I am not going to get this job. I had no fear when I went for the interview because I thought when I knew that I am not going to get this job, why to afraid. When you go for a job interview, there is an intention that I need this job, because of that you tend to give diplomatic answers. I just talked with my heart and said what I think. I presented all the knowledge, whatever I knew. I tried to keep a jovial environment, presented myself with whatever knowledge I had and without fear gave the interview. When you forget fear you can completely focus on the questions they are asking. You are free to explain, and it will become a discussion instead of an interview, they also try to correct you and give different perspectives. If I did not know the answer, instead of saying I don\u2019t know, I smartly said that it was a very interesting question; I never thought about it but will surely try to figure out the solution regarding this.\n\nAccording to you, who should ideally apply for this job?\n\nThere is no need for an ideal profile. Everyone can apply. Everyone is talented, so the way you present yourself decides your chances of getting selected.\n\nAny specific advice you want to give to the juniors sitting for placements this year.\n\nI think everybody has the knowledge, only because of fear they are not able to present it properly. So try to avoid fear. Keep in mind that you are studying in a prestigious college like IIT Kharagpur, so you will definitely get a job. Do not fear for your job. If not here, there are numerous opportunities outside. Just make sure that you maintain a positive atmosphere during your interview. Be honest but your honesty should not create a negative atmosphere. Try to make them feel good about you. Maintain some humour throughout the interview.\n\nWhat are some of the major points you think would be valid to mention while targeting this profile? (Any specific suggestions you would like to make?)\n\nProjects are very important. Based on the projects only, candidates are shortlisted. The company mainly focuses on the B.tech/M.tech projects. Present the projects in a way that they can understand. Do not make it complicated. Keep it simple to be understood."

As these concepts are very useful in other tests as well, the preparation for this test does not require any additional effort as such.\n\nIn my experience, the interview rounds have no specific structure. It is driven by the interviewer and the candidate. What is essentially being tested is the problem-solving ability of the candidate. The latter rounds do have the tendency to revolve around the credit and credit card business, hence it would be beneficial to read up on how companies like Amex and their competitors generate revenues and how they do so differently from each other. Overall, it is also important to make yourself extremely familiar with your resume, as questions regarding your CV can also be expected.\n\nQ. What difficulties did you face while preparing for this Company/Profile? How did you overcome this problem?\n\nA. The tests for companies that come later in the placement process seem easier simply because of the practice you get from continuously taking tests. As the test for Amex is usually quite early in the process, I found it difficult to be sufficiently prepared for it. However, it is in this case where you must approach your seniors or batchmates who have already been placed at Amex, so as to gain a better understanding of what would be required of you for the test, and subsequently the interview as well. As the interview process doesn\u2019t have a repeated structure that is followed year in and year out, the only way to be sufficiently prepared is through continuous practice. There is no getting around the required time investment. The plus side is that this practice would also be extremely beneficial for interviews for other companies as well.\n\nQ. According to you, who should ideally apply for this job?\n\nA. Any candidate interested in analytics must apply. Additionally, those interested in finance and consulting can also apply.\n\nQ. Any specific advice you want to give to the junta sitting for placements this year?\n\nA. Start preparations early, preferably by July-August. That also includes identifying which profiles you are interested in and concentrating on those. Starting early also affords you the time to work on your interview and soft skills, which are very important. Having the ability to appear confident and be personable can help you get through many interviews, and these skills can be acquired through practice. Start at 2 mock interviews a week. To that end, you can approach your batchies or seniors. It is most efficient and beneficial to learn from your peers. Being able to share acquired knowledge in this way will undoubtedly help all those involved.\n\nQ. What are some of the major points you think would be valid to mention while targeting this profile?\n\nA. It is important to consistently build on your skills, either by taking courses or doing projects. Either one (or ideally, both) on your CV will show recruiters that you are eager to learn. However, as I mentioned before, having good interview skills is at times more essential."

        "content": "FORESIGHT(2022): Placement at Tiger Analytics | Compilation\n\nBrief Introduction\n\nI\u2019m Arka Mandal. I am a dual degree student from the Mechanical Engineering department. I got placed at Tiger Analytics in the Data science role during the December placements.\n\nMy name is Samanvitha. I\u2019m a 5th year dual degree student from the Department of Civil Engineering with specialization in Environmental Engineering and Management. I\u2019m from Visakhapatnam, Andhra Pradesh.\n\nHow did you get into Tiger Analytics? What was the selection procedure?\n\nI got selected in Tiger Analytics \u2014 Data Science profile in the CDC placement drive. The company appeared on Day-3 of this year\u2019s placement session and the role was open to all the departments.\n\nComing to the selection procedure, there were 2 rounds of shortlisting tests. In the 1st online shortlist round, there were 2 sections (all questions were of MCQ type):\n\n1. Aptitude including quantitative aptitude, +2 level maths (few questions from conic sections) and general aptitude.\n\n2. Objective type questions on programming (like finding errors or output of the code, some theoretical, etc.). Most of them were of easy-moderate level but one needs to manage their time well to be able to get shortlisted for round 2.\n\nIn the 2nd shortlist round, there were 2 sections. 1st section had 3 questions (moderate level coding questions) out of which 2 are to be attempted and 2nd section had 2 questions (moderate-hard level coding questions) out of which 1 is to be attempted and the whole test must be completed in 1 hr. The platform was hackerearth.\n\nThen, based on test scores and CV, students were shortlisted for the interview.\n\nIt was about a 75\u201390 min elaborate interview, divided into 3 segments. The 1st section is more like a CV round which involved deep discussion of projects and internships that dealt with data and programming, and in between, related technical questions were also asked. The 2nd section is a coding round. A problem related to arrays was asked which was of moderate-hard level. In the 3rd section, some guesstimates, logical puzzles, and questions related to probability, statistics, permutations and combinations were asked.\n\nHow to prepare for them?\n\nRound 1 test- For aptitude and puzzles, you can use practice questions from Geeks for Geeks, Quantitative Aptitude, LR/DI by Arun Sharma, or any other good resource which covers almost all kinds of topics and problems, along with brushing up on Probability and Statistics courses. Taking time-based aptitude tests also helps. Practice and time management is the only key.\n\nMedium and hard puzzles on Brainstellar, Heard on the Street, 50 Challenging Problems in Probability, and Xinfeng Zhou are other good resources. Questions were like watered-down versions of CAT questions. You should Practice CAT/GMAT questions for quant. There were also abstract figure-type questions. For coding MCQs, basic data structures and algorithms should be revised.\n\nRound 2 test- For coding questions, I just practiced all example problems from Geeks for Geeks and questions from Hackerrank (as it has a similar interface to almost all coding tests), since I was short of time. Interviewbit is also a good option. Previous year questions and company-wise questions might also give you a better idea. You can also practice coding questions on Leetcode with a focus on medium-difficulty questions.\n\nInterview- Know your CV well. Prepare puzzles from popular sites like geeksforgeeks, besides others. I was asked 2 basic coding questions, so practice solving a coding question in an interview setting, i.e. solving a question while explaining your thought process.\n\nWhat difficulties did you face while preparing for this Company/Profile? How did you overcome this problem?\n\nA problem which I faced, not specifically for this company, but the whole process in general is that due to the process being conducted online, the companies\u2019 test schedules were quite hectic once the interviews had started. Also, just staring at computer screen for the whole time can be somewhat depressing.\n\nAccording to you, who should ideally apply for this job?\n\nTiger analytics has services/projects both in the space of ML/AI and Analytics. I came to know from a senior working there, that there are options for a new hire to work in both analytics stuff(dashboarding/generating insights and reports) or in ML/AI projects. Anyone who has an interest in data science, math, coding, and problem-solving can consider this job. Given that the company has business in multiple verticals, lateral shifts in the job should also be possible.\n\nAny specific advice you want to give to the junta sitting for placements this year?\n\nIf possible, try to take easy and less work-loaded courses and electives in your placement semester, in case you\u2019re flexible with your choices.\n\nDo not indulge yourself in several resources. Choose some wisely and be consistent.\n\nStay calm and focused. Surely you\u2019ll do better.\n\nThe placement season can be really frustrating and nerve-wracking at times. Even more so during the online scenario, when you are probably holed up in your home, with little interaction with your friends. It is imperative that you don\u2019t lose your confidence after interview/test rejections. It is very important that you retain your confidence and not go for any role which might come your way but is not your interest. Also, practice giving interviews with your friends to get habituated with the feeling for when the actual thing comes. Even if you aren\u2019t placed with the first few days, don\u2019t be hopeless. You\u2019ll eventually get placed."

I am a boarder of Meghnad Saha Hall of Residence. My interests are Mathematics, Deep Learning. I did projects and internships in Natural Language Processing and Computer Vision areas. I like to solve puzzles and every day I solve at least one sudoku.\n\nHow did you get into APT Portfolio? What was the selection procedure?\n\nFirstly, I would like to thank everyone who helped and motivated me during the placement drive and also a special mention to the APT portfolio for recruiting me. I got selected for the Data Scientist role which I aimed for. First, there was an online test that consists of competitive coding questions which are of a moderate level in which I did all the questions and followed by two rounds of coding interviews each of duration of around 45 minutes where they mainly focussed on trees, stacks and in each round, they asked 4\u20135 questions which we need to code in hackerrank platform. Generally, every company follows the same procedure for selection which is mentioned above, there will be an additional HR round at the last for most of the companies.\n\nHow to prepare for them?\n\nI started my preparation in December 2019 i.e., when I learned python and the basics of Machine Learning and did projects and internships in the summers (2020 and 2021) which helped me a lot in learning AI-related concepts in depth. Apart from my work experience, I prepared for competitive coding questions from InterviewBit and LeetCode during the internship and placement drive which is sufficient and must for anyone who is willing to give cp related tests which not just helped me in placement tests but also helped me in improving my thinking skills so I would recommend everyone not to neglect competitive programming especially if you are aiming for such roles.\n\nAccording to you, who should ideally apply for this job?\n\nThe one who is interested in Mathematics, Coding and has experience in Data Science is perfectly suited for this role. Apart from these, there are plenty of soft skills which are important such as communication, problem-solving, thinking skills and many more.\n\nAny specific advice you want to give to the junta sitting for placements this year?\n\nBe confident, prepare well, aim for roles in which you are not just interested but also had a belief that you can do justice for such roles. Don\u2019t get tensed about placement tests which will be hundreds in number, just be prepared and learn from your mistakes try to give your best in each and every test. Discuss with your friends who are also aiming for similar roles as the exchange of thoughts always helps you to grow better. During Interviews as most of them will happen at night till day 3 try to sleep whenever you get some free time. Do not get demotivated if you are not selected by a company stay motivated and be confident, you will definitely get selected if you believe in yourself.All the best to everyone who are going to sit for placements this year."

I am also UG Representative for Chemical Engineering Association.\n\nI received an offer from Honeywell for a full-time SWE role during the on-campus placement drive of 2021\u201322. I was also awarded as Campus winner for ITC\u2019s Interrobang Season-11 as part of its unconventional placement process for the SCM role.\n\nHow did you get into Honeywell? What was the selection procedure?\n\nI am placed at Honeywell during the 2021\u201322 campus placement drive during Dec\u201921. But the process was started 1\u20132 months before it. There were 3 rounds altogether.\n\nTechnical interview:\n\nHR Interview:\n\nHow to prepare for them?\n\nHonestly speaking, I started very late, So I haven\u2019t left with much time to do CP, but I would recommend one to do rigorous CP as it helps you to get through coding rounds easily, where I felt difficulty getting through, even after doing all questions due to competition in time taken.\n\nSince I haven\u2019t done a lot of CP, I was just building upon conceptual learning by doing various in-depth advanced algorithmic self-projects.\n\nIt just not helped me to learn and understand in-depth and intricate concepts in less time but also gave me good points to quote on my resume and even helped me to drive the interviews in my comfort zone.\n\nRemember that the best way to learn a concept is to apply it yourself to a real-life project.\n\nAccording to you who should ideally apply for this job\n\nThis company has business in different segments and fields and is a company that sells a product, not just only software. One who loves to see their ideas being implemented in real life, creates products to be used in large industries such as large shopping complexes, planes, etc.\n\nAny specific advice you want to give to the junta sitting for placements this year.\n\nAnything more you want to share?\n\nI want to share that I could not bag an internship in my CDC pre-final year. I had seen many of my friends who had got an internship but weren\u2019t very happy as it wasn\u2019t in one of the best companies. The same case might be with many more. Everyone should continue trying and never give up!\n\nAnother important point to be noted is to be clear with your thoughts. I was preparing for more than one profile, management, and software. Sometimes, in the HR round of the technical profile, I was talking about leadership skills. The interviewer did not like it as it suggested that I aimed to be a team leader rather than a team member(even though the team leader is in the first place a team member before being a leader). I would advise the juniors to keep a fine boundary between different profiles."

I am a student of the Department of Humanities and Social Sciences at IIT Kharagpur, enrolled in its Integrated MSc. course in Economics. I am offered a full-time position as an Associate (Sales and Trading) in the Fixed Income Division at Morgan Stanley.\n\nHow did you get into Morgan Stanley? What was the selection procedure?\n\nThe selection process was pretty standard. First, there was an aptitude test consisting of basic aptitude, basic finance, and English. The English section also contained audio and video questions. The test was simple but the recruiters were very selective. So, try to score full marks on the test.\n\nThere were, in total, three rounds of interviews (2 Technical + 1 HR). The first round was largely based on the domain knowledge in the fixed income market, some theoretical questions about bond pricing fundamentals, general market/economic news, a couple of brainteasers, and a simple guestimate.\n\nThe second round was also technical. They grilled me on my CV and asked some elementary questions about the time value of money. A general idea of the economy etc.\n\nThe final and the easiest round was HR. They asked pretty standard HR questions like strengths/weaknesses, Why Morgan Stanley, Why this profile, Why you, etc.\n\nHow to prepare for them?\n\nFor aptitude: CAT material\n\nBrainteasers: Heard on the Street (must), Xinfeng, Zhou\n\nGuestimate/ Cases: IITB Casebook\n\nFinance: CFA Level 1 material\n\nApart from these, a good resume is a must because all the shortlisting is done based on resume and CGPA.\n\nWhat difficulties did you face while preparing for this Company/profile? How did you overcome this problem?\n\nI am not good at coding and I tried analytics but didn\u2019t like it very much. So, finance and consulting were my only options. I didn\u2019t have any good PORs so I was left with finance. Luckily, that\u2019s what I liked. The problem is that there are not many companies that come for such profiles. It was a hard decision for me to stick to finance when there are ample opportunities and software and analytics. Still, I stuck with my decision and started focusing more and more on finance. I believe it is good to double down on your strengths rather than improve on your weakness because you can never be good at everything.\n\nAccording to you, who should ideally apply for this job?\n\nAn ideal candidate for this job is someone who is interested in finance and financial markets, willing to learn and explore different avenues in finance, has an above-average knowledge of finance, and has excellent communication skills. CFA is a \u201cgood to have\u201d but not a \u201cneed to have\u201d. It is a client-facing job and a collaborative profile so interpersonal skills are also very important.\n\nAny specific advice you want to give to the junta sitting for placements this year.\n\nPrepare for tests before you prepare for the interview.\n\nBe consistent in your efforts before and during the placements.\n\nPrepare a flawless CV and get it reviewed by as many seniors as possible.\n\nKnow your CV inside out and backwards.\n\nDon\u2019t underestimate the HR round. It is the easiest round but also easy to mess up.\n\nDo as many mock interviews as you can with your friends and seniors.\n\nFinally, keep calm, sleep well and be confident."

        "content": "FORESIGHT(2022): Placement at Groww | Abhijeet Mahato\n\nBrief Introduction\n\nMy name is Abhijeet Mahato; I am pursuing my dual degree in Agricultural and Food Engineering at IIT Kharagpur. Along with my academics, I interned at Resurgent Agric as a Product Management Intern. I worked closely with the founder to develop a product to debut in the e-commerce space. During my tenure at Resurgent Agric, I also got the opportunity to co-author a book for coffee stakeholders. Before that, I interned at VegaMX Inc., a US-based firm, where I worked on optimizing a Corn Yield Prediction Model using Machine Learning algorithms over historical and satellite imagery data.\n\nIn the last four years, I have held multiple PORs. I was the Event Head and Governor at Spectra, the fine arts and design group of IIT Kharagpur. In my hall of residence, I held the post of coordinator of fine arts and lawn tennis, where I was able to make the team secure multiple podium finishes.\n\nApart from my academics, I hold a degree in fine arts equivalent to a bachelor\u2019s in fine arts. Currently, I am trying my hands-on micro-blogging on LinkedIn, where I have achieved 5000+ average viewership on 20+ product and agricultural-based posts.\n\nHow did you get into Groww? What was the selection procedure?\n\nWhen Groww came, they had their pre-placement talk. In that, they gave us the problem statement. We have to prepare a case study on that. The problem statement was, \u201cas we are graduating, we are on the verge of attaining financial independence, so we have to make a digital product that would help solve the pain points of the new generation who are just graduating.\u201d They gave 1\u20131.5 weeks for the submission. After the case study was submitted, they released their shortlist based on CV and case round. And then, we were allotted our buddies (current APMs working at Groww) with whom we could interact, solve issues, clarify all our queries and prepare for interviews. The buddies were allotted 3 to 4 days before the interview; after that, we interacted with the co-founder, where all the shortlisted students, like APM, business analysts, etc., had an interaction with the founder. The interview happened on Day 2, so there were four rounds. The 1st round was a simple case round in which I was asked a general question: \"Introduce yourself; how many profiles am I applying for, and why product management?\u201d Then the interviewer asked, \u201cHow many shortlists do you have?\u201d Then we had a root-cause analysis case.Similarly, the 2nd round involved some basic questions about myself, and they also gave me a product development case. The 3rd round was a more professional root-cause-analysis round. And the 4th and final round was an interaction with one of the co-founders of Groww.\n\nThe 1st round was around 20 mins. The case given to me was, \u201cYou are an APM at uber, and I\u2019m hearing from my friend that the customer experience from uber is reducing and it\u2019s not as par with its competitor,\u201d and I have to do a root cause analysis for this.\n\nIn the 2nd round, the interviewer gave me a product development case \u201cSuppose you are working at Groww, you are given the assignment of creating a subscription model for the users of Groww,\u201d so I had to do a proper end-to-end discussion and make a framework that how will I make an action-plan, what all data points and parameters I will consider for creating the subscription model and why? What will be my basis for the pricing of this subscription model? What will be my main objective behind the introduction of this subscription model? How will I launch the subscription model in the market? What will be my crucial matrix to see this subscription model's success? What will be my roll-out plan? This round went a bit longer, around 40- 50 minutes, since it was a proper discussion round, and we had a good conversation like he was enacting a good company scenario.\n\nThe 3rd round was also a root cause analysis round. It was a bit detailed compared to the 1st round. It went around 30 minutes, and here also brought the problem statement from uber itself. The problem statement was, \u201cThe number of drivers canceling the orders from Uber\u2019s end has increased.\u201d I had to do a root cause analysis on this. I felt that the interviewer had made up his mind that he wanted to test how much I could bear him in the interview as he grilled me a lot in exploring the root cause of the problem. It became a little nerve-wracking in the end, but I kept my patience and explored different possibilities with a structured approach. He was trying to check whether I knew the news and what was happening in the external market. After that, he gave me one more problem statement, mainly based on checking my thought process. The problem statement was, \u201cIt has been observed that users are downloading the Swiggy app but later switching to the Zomato app.\u201d So, I had to figure out why they were switching. He gave me around 5 minutes and asked me to lay down my procedure and thoughts.\n\nAnd after that, I got a call from HR that we are extending our offer to you, so don\u2019t sit for any other interviews today.\n\nHow to prepare for them?\n\nI began my preparation specific to the APM profile somewhere around 1st week of October. Reflecting on my placement journey, I can break down my practice into 3 phases.\n\nPhase 1: October\n\nPhase 2: Up to Mid-November\n\nPhase 3: Mid to End of November\n\nWhat difficulties did you face while preparing for this Company/Profile? How did you overcome this problem?\n\nA few difficulties which I felt during my preparation were as follows:\n\nAccording to you, who should ideally apply for this job?\n\nWell, I have just got into this role, so I am not entirely aware of what the recruiters look for in a particular candidate for APM roles. But yes, I would answer this based on my personal experience, which may or may not be the same for all cases.\n\nIn my opinion, there are three skills essential to any candidate applying for this role:\n\nAlso, it is good to have experience leading and working in a team, solution-orientated projects, internships involving customer interaction/surveys, strategic planning, analytical solutions, etc.\n\nAn individual interested or inclined to work in the field of strategy or planning and does not exceptionally enjoy coding or data profile must try this profile. Also, individuals interested in and preparing for consulting profiles should apply for this profile.\n\nAny specific advice you want to give to the junta sitting for placements this year?\n\nMany things are essential for placements, and writing them down would be difficult as I have come out of the placement procedure. Some items might appear very silly to me, but they might be necessary for many juniors out there. However, I\u2019ll try to give out some crucial essential advice that I feel is not discussed much in general.\n\nYour CV is the first and foremost document that creates an impression in front of recruiters. What\u2019s the point of having excellent preparation for the interview if your CV doesn\u2019t make curiosity about you, the recruiters? Also, on average, companies receive 100+ CVs, meaning if it doesn\u2019t grab the viewer's attention in the first 5\u20136 seconds, it slims your chances of creating your impression. I want to highlight, in general, we prepare our CVs based on how I view our work and achievements. But, from my experience, I would say prepare your CV from the recruiter\u2019s POV of what will be relevant or essential for them. Also, I would advise getting your CVs reviewed by your immediate seniors, your 2+ year seniors, your 5+ year seniors, and 10+ year seniors. The reason is, this way, you will get to know what is the general recruiters\u2019 mindset trending these days. Thus, a minimum of 2 to 3 weeks is necessary for all these procedures and to build the best CV for yourself.\n\nOne of the best opportunities provided during interviews is the questions \u201cTell me about Yourself / Introduce Yourself / Walk me through your CV.\u201d This is the perfect opportunity to determine the flow and direction of your entire interview. Thus, instead of a basic intro, prepare a good and acceptable pitch for yourself so that the listener is more interested in knowing about you as an individual. We all have a hesitant tendency to under-selling ourselves in critical and high-risk situations, which is wildly inaccurate in doing interviews. Thus, always remember you are the \u201csalesman of yourself during placements,\u201d and prepare a strong pitch accordingly.\n\nWhile talking about any internship, project, PoR, or anything, always address it in a way \u2014 What did you do? What was the impact? How did you do it? What did you learn? And finally, How the learning made you a better candidate for the applied profile?\n\nNarrate a story in front of the recruiters rather than just giving orthodox boring answers, which they would have heard all day long throughout several interviews.\n\nDuring placement preparations, you are very likely to get piled up with a lot of work, and it is highly likely to miss some important tasks or deadlines. Thus, I advise maintaining a whiteboard where you write every small job to be done now, tomorrow, or in the future. Also, use it as a note sheet for preparation and concept revision, as visual reminders are helpful."

What was the selection procedure?\n\nThe CDC placement process starts with the registration and initiation of the CV portal (in the CDC tab of ERP) post-Durga Puja in early October. Students are given around two weeks to create and edit their CVs with which they would apply for various companies. Once the CV portal closes, the companies start coming for CDC or accept student applications (through CV application, company portal use, etc., and sometimes a combination of more than one application procedure). Rakuten Mobile is given a slot preferably on Day 1 or Day 2 (this time, they were given a slot on Day 2, implying they would hold the final selection interviews for shortlisted students on December 2 and select the students on the same day; Day 1 begins on December 1). Since the company comes quite early in the interview process, they start their student application process quite early, too (expect them to go for a CV application just after the CV portal closes). Through the initial screening round (internal company selection), the shortlisted students will get a link for further online exam rounds. The online exam consists of quite a few MCQs in the first section, followed by a coding team consisting of two coding questions. The exam is conducted on a Japanese platform (not in Hackerrank, HackerEarth, Mettle, etc., generally used for tests in maximum companies). Their platform has English as the mode of communication. Once the students qualify for the online exam rounds, they will be shortlisted for the final interview round. The interview round consists of 2 rounds and is held on Zoom. The first round is a Technical round, and crossing it would lead you to the final round, the HR round. Finally, after clearing all these exams and rounds of interviews, if the performance is good enough, they will roll out the offer for you, which one needs to confirm their choice (accept or reject) compulsorily by the end of the day.\n\nNOTE: This is the general procedure common to the companies, with only the number of shortlisting exams and interview rounds being a variable from company to company.\n\nHow to prepare for them?\n\nRakuten Mobile comes for the profile of Software Engineer, which consists of the following sub-divisions:\n\nSo, the online exam is structured in such a way that it touches all the topics at a level that can be easily solved by students currently pursuing undergraduate engineering degrees. Nonetheless, you need good domain knowledge of the field you have been preparing for, which will take care of the MCQ section. MCQ section can have questions regarding associated concepts, code snippets output, general knowledge about relevant technology and IQ, and reasoning-based questions. Though there will be a lot of MCQs, sufficient time will be provided. For the coding section, you need to be well-versed in Data Structures and Algorithms , not to mention you should practice coding regularly. The coding questions have an easy to moderate difficulty level and can be easily cracked if one is diligent in practice. TIP: Always try to complete the test 100% correctly as quickly as possible. With a large number of people giving the exam, your submission time decides if you are getting shortlisted or not.\n\nMy profile was that of Data Science (it is very important to remember that even for the data science profile, there would be an initial coding round to shortlist students for interviews). So, to sit for this role, it is very necessary that one has Machine Learning concepts clear to the very basics, has experience in Python programming at the least, and not to mention a good grasp of maths and statistics. The students would be required to take up some online data science courses to build up their knowledge from scratch and do at least two projects to gain working experience. One alsohas to necessarily do at least one internship in data science, artificial intelligence, or ML roles to get industry and corporate experience to know the ins and outs of what a data scientist must do daily. Every bit of experience counts when one is applying for data science roles. This will count a lot during the interview processes of Rakuten Mobile.\n\nStudents are also advised to prepare for the HR round. Being a Japanese company, they will look towards a student\u2019s interest in learning the language and relocating to Japan. They will also appreciate it if you have researched a bit about the company and are aware of Japanese culture and customs. This round is about projecting your interests towards the company and giving them a sense of assurance that their goals match yours. They are very eager to answer questions about the company and its various professional aspects, and also they will happily take up questions regarding Japan. Try to remain disciplined and courteous in how you speak and behave with the interviewers; that goes a long way in making a solid impression. Students might also want to brush up on generic online HR questions.\n\nHow would you describe the work culture in your company? How is thework-life balance?\n\nI am still a student at IIT Kharagpur until the end of April and will join the company on 1st October 2022. So, I do not have sufficient information regarding the same. I would request the students check online reviews from websites like Glassdoor.\n\nHow was your experience working from home? What difficulties did you face?\n\nLet me start by mentioning that I secured a CDC internship at Persistent Systems, a product-based company based out of Pune. This was during the pandemic, so my internship was working from home. The cons of working from home outweigh the pros, in my opinion. The very purpose of training is to give the students a corporate experience before the actual placements, and the fact that we have had to work from home defeats the whole purpose. At the same time, it is true that in an online mode of internship, you are not required to be present and available at all times, with briefing meetings taking place once or twice daily, giving you more time to complete the designated tasks. However, this also means that your managers and mentors in the internship would not be available most of the time to clear your doubts. So, I would not say I have had the most incredible experience working from home, and I would recommend anyone else to opt for the onsite experience. However, it should be noted that it is not a discredit to the company. I was involved in a very industry-relevant project with massive future implications, and I was glad I could contribute to that project.\n\nAccording to you, who should ideally apply for this job?\n\nGiven below is the extent of operations of Rakuten Group, Inc.\n\nI should give a short description of Rakuten Mobile Inc. as a company. Founded in 2018, it is a Rakuten Group (established in 1997) company responsible for mobile communications, including mobile network operator (MNO) and mobile virtual network operator (MVNO) businesses, as well as ICT and energy. Through continuous innovation and the deployment of advanced technology, Rakuten Mobile aims to redefine expectations in the mobile communications industry to provide appealing and convenient services that respond to diverse customer needs. They entered the mobile carrier business in 2019 as the fourth carrier in Japan and are a global leader, provider, and innovator of mobile technology and communications platforms, transforming the industry by launching the world\u2019s first end-to-end cloud-native mobile network.\n\nSo, anyone aligning with the aims mentioned above and ambitions should look forward to joining this company. In a previous image, I described the roles available under Software Engineer roles and their descriptions. Students who have been preparing dedicatedly for Software and Data Science roles should actively seek to join this company, and students from both core Electronics and Electrical Engineering backgrounds. However, it should be mentioned that while the company opens for all departments, recent history suggests that it selects only circuital department (CSE, E&ECE, EE, MNC) students after the final round. Apart from the professional aspect, I should mention the extra incentives I know many students would be interested in. The CTC offered (I am not at liberty to discuss the figures) is highly competitive for undergraduate freshers with well-structured career development opportunities. I think I have also not yet mentioned that they recruit for their Tokyo office in Japan (if it is not the greatest motivation to join the company, then I do not know what is). So, people who admire Japanese culture, be it their language, anime, food, etc., should look forward to applying to this company. Also, do not forget that Rakuten sponsors FC Barcelona and VIssel Kobe, where Andreas Iniesta still plays football. So they have highly globalized their operations in recent years.\n\nAny specific advice you want to give to the junta sitting for placements this year?\n\nFirst of all, I would like to take this opportunity to thank the CDC Placement Committee members for their selfless and untiring efforts behind the scenes to ensure a seamless and successful internship and placement process. Students must remain in touch with 3 to 4 PlaceComms throughout the process. That would help them clarify their issues and doubts about the process rather than relying upon incorrect or semi-correct information obtained from peers. Your first point of contact should be PlaceComm(s) from your hall of residence, and if not available, any other PlaceComm will do too.\n\nI have seen many people ease up after they get an internship. But work should not stop there. The students should actively learn before, during, and after their internship. Preparation for placements should be continuous and dedicated, spread over a long time. Do not leave any bits while preparing and cover all relevant topics for placements.\n\nStudents should never lie in their CVs and interviews. This statement is relatively self-explanatory. CDC asks for proof of involvement regarding everything mentioned in the CV. A red flag in this stage of scrutiny can lead to unwanted problems for the student. Always be thorough with the contents in your CV and be prepared to take extensive questions on their specifics during the interviews.\n\nBefore giving exams and interviews, students are advised to have sufficient food and rest, and they should be energized enough to tackle 3-hour continuous sessions. CDC processes are very uncertain regarding how the shortlists are generated, what evaluation criteria the company has decided amongst themselves, and the final results. So, students are advised to accept that they will undoubtedly face rejection along the way. The task of paramount importance is to get over the rejections and disappointments and shift your attention to the next exam or interview.Also, remember that CDC internship performance does not positively correlate with CDC placement performance. One might perform unsatisfactorily during the internship and do quite well in the placement process (like me).\n\nIt is very important to realize that your CGPA plays a significant role in CDC processes; hence, one should never undermine the advantage a good CGPA brings to the table. Also, people tend to forget that off-campus presents many opportunities. It is a gold mine if you are thinking about exploring that. One advantage which CDC gives over off-campus processes is that it is quick, reliable, secure, and provides comparatively better compensation.\n\nJealousy kills a person slowly from the inside. However, it is virtually impossible not to be jealous of your peers around you based on their placements. I would only mention that being in an IIT has already given us an advantage and privilege over other institutes across India based on future career prospects. Understand the importance of it and remember that you might progress higher than a peer you were jealous of in the future. So soak in the experiences, enjoy the journey, and all the best for the upcoming internships and placements. KGPians have historically always been successful in the face of adversity, and as your senior, I know you will too.\n\nYO KGP! Peace!"

        "content": "FORESIGHT(2022): Placement at Graviton Research Capital LLP | Yash Butala\n\nBrief Introduction\n\nI am Yash Butala, a final year Dual Degree student of Computer Science at IIT Kharagpur. I received offers from Graviton Research Capital LLP and Google India. My Day1 shortlists included companies such as Uber, Rubrik, Quadeye, Quantbox, Apple, etc. My prior internship experience provides research internships with Adobe and IBM. To briefly tell you about my profile. I worked as a software developer intern at Amazon Germany. I was a member of the AUV Research Group at IIT Kharagpur. Apart from my work experience, I am good at problem-solving (competitive programming) and have some publications.\n\nHow did you get into Graviton Software? What was the selection procedure?\n\nGraviton visited the campus for the Software and Quant Role. Graviton conducted tests for shortlisting candidates for their interviews. I appeared for the Software test, where there were two coding questions and around 4\u20135 theoretical questions. The coding questions were medium-hard, and I solved them fully. In theory, there were questions on concepts revolving around OS, DBMS, Networks, and Computer architecture. Students were expected to write steps for theory-based questions. I solved some of these questions. Since I completed all coding queries and a good amount of theoretical questions, I was shortlisted for the Graviton placement interview.\n\nThe interviewer mainly asked questions about C++ and operating systems. I was told in the interview that they were happy with my performance in the coding test. In short, Graviton looks into candidates\u2019 profiles holistically. There are no single criteria, but a decent GPA, a grasp of concepts in C++, and previous internship experience will be beneficial.\n\nHow to prepare for them?\n\nGraviton Research is a high-frequency trading firm that requires low-level coding. One can expect questions from C++, operating systems, computer networks, and computer architecture. \u2018Learn CPP\u2019 is a good source for knowing the functionalities of the C++ language. For operating systems, networks, and computer architecture, the courses and standard textbooks will help. For competitive programming, one can practice contests on CodeForces, Leetcode, etc. \u2018CP Algorithms\u2019 website is a good source for revising algorithms.\n\nHow would you describe the work culture in your company? How is the work-life balance?\n\nI am yet to begin my job at Graviton, so I may not be able to provide the most accurate insights. Regarding my interaction with employees, the company has a flat hierarchy and a startup-like fast-paced environment. The team is small and has talented engineers from different IITs. There is a lot of handwork and learning that comes with all this.\n\nAccording to you, who should ideally apply for this job?\n\nAnyone interested in trading or computer systems must apply for the job. The HFTs don\u2019t expect students to know about low-latency programming or trading beforehand but look for the student's interest.\n\nAny specific advice you want to give to the junta sitting for placements this year?\n\nStart preparing early and manage your time well. Figure out the profile of companies you are interested in and work smartly. Proofread the resume (if possible, seek the help of seniors) and practice mock interviews as much as possible. Stay calm and assertive during all the tests and interviews."

        "info": "Since the nature of the job is client-facing, they evaluate your communication skills and depth of knowledge.",
        "content": "FORESIGHT(2022): Placement at DC Advisory | Ishan Das\n\nBrief Introduction\n\nHello, I am Ishan Das; I shall join DC Advisory as an Investment Banking Junior Analyst after graduation.\n\nDC Advisory is a leading corporate finance advisor specializing in cross-border transactions. As part of an established global business, we offer access to over 500 professionals throughout Asia, Europe, and the US. DC Advisory provides tailored independent advice on M&A, debt raisings, and restructurings.\n\nHow did you get into DC Advisory? What was the selection procedure?\n\nFirst, a form was circulated in which we had to enter our prior internship and project experiences in Finance. Moreover, we had to fill in details about completed Finance certifications like CFA and FRM. This was followed by an online test with a few HR questions, a guesstimate, a puzzle, and 5\u201310 questions based on Financial Statements and their analysis. The finance questions were easy if you have religiously studied the CFA curriculum. DC Advisory took interviews on Day 1. I had two interviews (40\u201350 minutes each) (both rounds were similar). Both rounds were comprehensive \u2014 starting with generic questions to gauge the interest and drive of the candidates. Questions like \u2014 Why Finance as an engineer? Why Investment Banking? What do Investment Banking firms do? How is DC advisory different from its competitors? Tell us about the major deals of DC advisory in the past year. Then we had some discussion about the Indian deal landscape and startup ecosystem. This was followed by a discussion on the IPO scenario in India \u2014 was it a bubble? What is your view on the coming decade for India\u2019s startup ecosystem?\n\nSince the nature of the job is client-facing, they evaluate your communication skills and depth of knowledge. It\u2019s crucial to be a structured and thoughtful communicator. These skills are developed over time, generally with our engagements on campus. Being good at these discussions will come naturally to you if you are well-read and are passionate about Finance.\n\nThen I was asked a few guesstimates. You can follow the Case Interviews Cracked IIT-B case book, Guesstimate-Compendium, by Consulting Club FMS for guesstimates.\n\nI also highly recommend doing case preparation with your batchmates since this will help you structure your communication skills and boost your confidence.\n\nFinally, they tested my knowledge of Finance. Financial Reporting and Analysis, Economics, and understanding recent happenings are essential for Investment Banking roles. If you are comfortable with the CFA level 1 curriculum, that should be enough in most cases. In some roles, you might be grilled on advanced concepts of DCF Models, Financial Statement projections, US GAAP vs. IFRS principles, etc.\n\nFor other Finance roles (e.g., Global Markets Analyst roles) that hire from KGP \u2014 FRM Level 1 syllabus is more relevant. You should know about the various Financial asset classes (Stocks, Bonds, and other Fixed Income instruments, Options and BSM Model theory, Futures, Forwards, MBSs, CDSs, Swaps, etc.) and their valuation and risk measures. It would help if you also understood the previous Financial disasters, their triggers, how they unfolded, and the damage they did. This, combined with the knowledge of how Financial markets and institutions are organized, should be sufficient to get you an analyst role.\n\nHow to prepare for them?\n\nI devoted the month of November to revising the Finance concepts that I had already studied while preparing for FRM level 1 and CFA level 1. I was already well aware of the recent happening in the world of Business and Finance, both national and international. Apart from this, I did the vital but often overlooked HR prep. I practiced some Probability and Statistics puzzles to brush up on the basics. This was enough to get me through.\n\nFor probability, statistics and puzzles, I recommend finishing the books \u2014 Xinfeng Zhou \u2014 A Practical Guide To Quantitative Finance Interviews, Heard on the Street, Quantitative Questions from Wall Street Job Interviews-Timothy Falcon Crack, brainstellar.com and 50 Problems in Probability by Frederick Mosteller.\n\nGuesstimates \u2014 I mentioned the sources in the previous question. Don\u2019t forget the case prep! Focus more on M&A and business strategy-related cases.\n\nFinance \u2014 CFA level 1 and FRM level 1 syllabus is enough for all Finance roles.\n\nFinancial News \u2014 Finshots, BloombergQuint, Bloomberg Finance, Wall Street Journal, the Ken, Mint, etc. Start religiously following these at least five months before the interviews. I would also advise doing CAT RCs to boost your reading speed. You can read books by authors like Ruchir Sharma and form a macro view of the markets.\n\nHow would you describe the work culture in your company? How is the work-life balance?\n\nI haven\u2019t worked at an IB firm yet, so this is the first time I will also experience it. I have gathered that Investment Banking roles (similar to most client-facing roles like consulting) are demanding and competitive. At the same time, they offer you a fast-track career with growth and learning experiences that are hard to match in any other industry. Like any other decision, this is a tradeoff between growth and WL balance, and you should decide for yourself based on your personality and lifestyle choices. I assure you that if you enjoy the job, even 14 hours of grueling work can be enjoyable.\n\nAccording to you, who should ideally apply for this job?\n\nThis is a high-pressure job that demands a particular skill set. You should ideally apply for this job if you have a knack for business and finance and a drive to make a dent in this ever-changing hyper-competitive business world.\n\nAny specific advice you want to give to the junta sitting for placements this year?\n\nThe industry you want to work in fresh out of college will decide a significant part of your career trajectory. Many people get lost in the rat race to score the best-paying job or enter the field everyone else is chasing. Many misguided students make this major life decision with short-term goals in their minds or, even worse \u2014 by following the herd. Don\u2019t do that! Think about the long run \u2014 decide which job suits your personality type and temperament, which job gives you satisfaction, and which jobs will help you get where you want to be ten years down the line. All the best! May you get what you want."

        "content": "FORESIGHT(2022): Placement at Da Vinci Derivatives | Kousshik Raj\n\nBrief Introduction\n\nHello folks! I will discuss my CDC placement experience leading to an offer from Da Vinci Derivatives. First, a bit about myself and my background. I am Kousshik Raj, a dual degree student from the Computer Science and Engineering Department. I interned at Quadeye Securities, an HFT, as a Systems Engineer. I entered the CDC placement process and received an offer from Da Vinci Derivatives, an HFT, for the Software Engineer position in The Netherlands.\n\nHow did you get into Da Vinci Derivatives? What was the selection procedure?\n\nDuring the placement process, I opted for the positions I was interested in, mostly related to Systems and Software. Among these, I was very much interested in the HFT ones, in which Da Vinci Derivatives was one among my top considerations. Moving on to the particulars of their selection process, there was an online test for 30\u201340 mins. Unconventionally, the focus of the test was primarily C++ functionalities and semantics, with 50 MCQs on them, which was quite in my favor, considering that was one of my fortes. After this, I was shortlisted for the interview process, and I believe there were not more than five people who got through for this role.\n\nThe interview process was very straightforward. There was only a single round of interviews, which went on for around an hour, which can be treated as a mix of technical and HR. We started with my introduction, then moved on to my work during my internship, considering the roles were nearly the same. There were many questions regarding my work, how I approached it, the difficulties I faced, and my overall experience. Moving on, there were general algorithm and data structures questions, the complexities of various containers in STL, and then there were questions on the concepts of process and threading. The implications of various standard practices and the tradeoffs considered were also tested. Overall, they tested how I perform over a wide array of topics, and although none of them were complex, all of them, in one way or another, required quite some out of box thought. Then I was asked about my general interest in the role and the company. Other significant projects I have worked on were also examined. Finally, after an hour of satisfying interview experience, I got to know about my acceptance at the end of the interview.\n\nNow let\u2019s talk about all the behind-the-scenes stuff, aka preparations. In general, all HFTs that post a System/Software engineer will somehow or the other test your C++ skills, as it is one of the go-to choices for developing their platforms. Well, at least in most cases, this is true. And anyway, having a solid foundation in C++ is always a big plus. And one of my most exciting and promising sources of preparation is here. Feel free to use this or any other sound source online. Besides this, being well-versed in algorithms and data structures is a must, which is essential for almost every role out there. And for this, I\u2019d say Competitive Programming helped me the most. I have been taking up CP on and off since my 1st year, solving numerous problems and participating in various contests across platforms like Codeforces, CodeChef, etc. This has helped me hone my algorithm and data structure knowledge and improve my problem-solving skills. And finally, I have also brushed up my knowledge of Operating Systems and Computer Networks, as this is a part of the core technical knowledge involved in the work you will carry out if you are selected and will be most surely tested.\n\nAccording to you, who should ideally apply for this job?\n\nIn general, I think people who are very interested in programming and Systems, in particular, will enjoy the work that is expected of you in these sorts of roles. Although things might be a handful, they will also be exciting, keeping you occupied.\n\nAny specific advice you want to give to the junta sitting for placements this year?\n\nOne of the most critical aspects usually neglected is your CGPA. Usually, such positions also expect excellent academic results. So have to work on that, if you are interested. Involving yourself in other non-academic development and technical projects will also give you quite an advantage over your peers who didn\u2019t. Keep yourself motivated and brush up on the nec-usually-essary knowledge, and you are all set to go. All the best, junta!"

        "content": "FORESIGHT(2022): Placement at Wells Fargo| Bharat Chaudhary\n\nBrief Introduction\n\nMy Name is Bharat Chaudhary. I am a fifth-year undergraduate student at the Department of Mathematics enrolled in its five-year integrated MSc Course of Mathematics and Computing. I am a Border of Pt. Madan Mohan Malviya Hall of Residence. I am from Hanumangarh (Rajasthan).\n\nHow did you get into Wells Fargo? What was the selection procedure?\n\nSo Wells Fargo came in CDC placement Tests in the early phase. The test was around 23 October. There were two roles to apply one was analytics and one was Technical Associate which is similar to software engineer.\n\nThe online Test was on the Amcat Platform.\n\nThere were three sections in the online test. For both profiles The test was the same.\n\nThe first section was English and second section was Aptitude and the final section has 2 coding questions. One coding question was medium and one was difficult. It is very important to attempt both questions even if you can\u2019t get all test cases passed you can go for partial test cases as well.\n\nSo on the basis of this two different shortlist was made from the same test.\n\nThere were two rounds of Interviews. The first was technical and managerial. It went for more than one hour. They first asked me to introduce myself then they asked me to go through my projects one by one. They asked questions about my projects like why I use this algorithm what was the complexity, can you explain the algorithm. After this, they asked about my 2 month internship project. They asked me questions of the spring boot framework because I have used that in my internship. They also asked me about layers of the spring framework, what task I did in my internship, which database I used and why.\n\nAfter that they gave me two medium coding questions, one was based on the array and one was based on sorting. They also asked me to write pseudo code on google docs with screen sharing so it is important to prepare for code writing as well. Then they asked me questions about oops and operating systems. These were basic questions. Then some managerial questions were given on some situations and how I would handle things, so for this just gave the answer which you think is correct and not to impress the panelists.\n\nAfter 1st round, there was The last round of the HR round. The HR round went for 10 minutes. She asked me about my background, my strengths, my motivation in my family.\n\nAfter that I got my confirmation that I was selected by the company.\n\nHow to prepare for them?\n\nFirst of all you should know whatever you are writing in your CV. You should revise all your projects thoroughly because they will ask in-depth questions about your projects in the internships.\n\nSecond thing which I think is important to do in a sde role is at least having one backend project based on the spring framework. Most Companies use spring boot as primary framework and you should also know about javascript, databases. Highlight these things in your CV so that panelists ask questions on this and be prepared for this.\n\nNow coming to most important part coding, try solving all medium level problems on leetcode. Go through all gfg interview experience of that particular company. Leetcode is more than enough for your coding round and interviews. Complete all your concepts in DSA from geeksforgeeks it is the best resource available. While practice give your concentration on time complexity and space complexity. Try solving 3\u20134 good coding problems on daily basis.\n\nFor oops,os,networks you can refer to some good youtube channels for basic understanding, you can read them from articles on gfg or you can take the basic course of gfg for all these subjects where you can prepare well for interview.\n\nHow would you describe the work culture in your company? How is the work-life balance?\n\nI can\u2019t describe much but whatever info I got from my seniors work-life balance is best in wells fargo.\n\nAccording to you, who should ideally apply for this job?\n\nI would say apply in every profile because we all are not industry experts, they will ask basic questions on profiles. But ideally for applying in Wells Fargo one who has strong hold on coding and projects, has a CG above 8. CG is very important. In roles like SDE or Analytics, your PORs will not matter at all. If you have less CGPA then you should have the best coding among your batchmates that thing only can ensure good placements in SDE roles. But in the last CGPA matters, a lot and good projects in CV will increase your chances.\n\nAny specific advice you want to give to the junta sitting for placements this year?\n\nplan well and start early. Two things that are most important in your life is time and management so start preparing coding practice early even when you are doing your internships because even if you get a PPO, coding will help you in off-campus placements as well."

I am from Kolkata and I will be joining Accenture as an MCD Associate in the Indian Marketing Unit.\n\nHow did you get into Accenture? What was the selection procedure?\n\nWe had to apply through the CDC portal of the ERP section as well as the link provided by the company. The role was open to almost all departments without any additional CGPA criteria.\n\nScreening test:\n\nAll the applicants were allowed to sit for the online screening test, which consisted of mainly three sections: quantitative aptitude, logical reasoning and vocabulary section. Almost after 3 weeks, the shortlist was published and one week later the interview procedure was conducted.\n\nBuddy mapping session:\n\nAround 25 students were shortlisted for the further interview rounds, and each of them was assigned a buddy by the company. The role of a buddy is to clear the individual\u2019s doubt regarding the role or how exactly one should prepare for the interview.

Generally, recruiters seek for a CV that has a perfect balance of work experiences (preferably related to finance), skills (basic ones like SQL, Excel, etc) and PORs. Try to include your academic as well as extra-curricular achievements in your resume. Always get it reviewed by your seniors; there is always a scope for improvement.

Different mock test portals are easily available in the internet, find the quality ones and solve those within a specific time.\n\nInterview preparation:\n\nPracticing with your peer group with similar profiles is the best way to prepare for the interviews. I would suggest few books like Victor Cheng, Case in Point, etc. Solve the guesstimates and cases together, also practice some mock interviews, especially for the HR rounds. There are seniors who will always be eager to help you. Your answers should not sound mechanical. Prepare basic questions like, why do you think you are eligible for this role or what values you think you will be able to add to the company. Finally, the interview round is the last hurdle you gotta overcome to achieve your dream job, so just give your best.\n\nHow would you describe the work culture in your company? How is the work-life balance?\n\nI guess I am not in a position to answer this question. From the few meetings I have attended I would say the campus recruitment team has been quite friendly and approachable, and they are always eager to clear any kinds of doubt you have.\n\nWhat difficulties did you face?\n\nCDC procedure is always hectic, also it was an online procedure for us, and so networking and managing our mental health have been a little bit tough.\n\nAccording to you, who should ideally apply for this job?\n\nWell, not only for this job but personally I think one should go for a certain role only if he/she is really passionate about it. A career is a long-term commitment, so go for the profile which suits you the most. Coming to this job, consulting is all about dealing with clients, and working in a team which includes lots of travel and almost 60+ working hours per week. So one should consider these factors, before opting out for this profile.\n\nAny specific advice you want to give to the junta sitting for placements this year.\n\n2\u20133 months is enough to prepare for the placement session, so make good usage of your summer vacation. Few quick points would be these-"

I completed my schooling in Bangalore and did my B.Tech in Civil Engineering from NIT Trichy before joining IIT KGP for my M.Tech. I got placed at Mercedes-Benz Research & Development India during the Phase 1 placement season of 2021\u201322 and I will be joining the company as a Post Graduate Engineer Trainee(PGET) in Mechanical from August 2022.\n\n2. How did you get into MBRDI? What was the selection procedure?\n\nThe company conducted its online test on the 27th of November. It consisted of 40 questions where the first 20 questions were those of General Aptitude and the next 20 were core mechanical engineering questions. 18 students qualified for the online test and they were selected further for the interview process on the 3rd of December. The interview process consisted of 3 stages: the first stage was the Technical interview where there were 3 panelists who asked me to introduce myself first and then asked questions on basic subjects like Strength of Materials, Structural Analysis, and Finite Element Modelling. After this, I had my second interview which was a Managerial interview with one interviewer. He asked me questions about myself, my background and more about my hobbies. He also asked me some basic interview questions like those about my future plans, conflict resolution in the workspace, why I would like to join the company, etc. The third interview was the HR round where the HR representative called me to tell me more about the company, the CTC, the job location and the perks of the job.\n\n3. How to prepare for them?\n\nFor the online test, prepare for the General Aptitude section as you would for any competitive exam like GATE with varied topics like verbal ability, permutation and combination, work and time, etc. For the core mechanical questions, keep your foundation throughout all 4 years of engineering very strong because they ask only the basic questions. Next for the Technical interview round, again keep your basics clear as they ask more of \u201chow\u201d or \u201cwhy\u201d questions than \u201cwhat\u201d questions. They only try to test your approach to a problem and how you analyze a question rather than what your final answer is. They also asked me questions about FEM and simulations in ABAQUS. For the Managerial interview, prepare all basic HR questions like where do you see yourself in 5 years, tell me more about yourself, your strengths, weaknesses and be prepared to answer questions about your CV.\n\n4. What difficulties did you face while preparing for this Company /Profile? How did you overcome this problem?\n\nThe only problem that I faced while preparing for the placements was the vastness of the engineering syllabus. Covering the entire syllabus of the four years of engineering is a difficult task but I had already written GATE so I started revising the portions early on and since I had studied all the subjects in prior, I had my basics of civil engineering clear.\n\n5. According to you, who should ideally apply for this job?\n\nAccording to me, all the non-circuital branch students who are interested in research and simulations can apply for this role because they ask the most basic mechanical questions like those included in Strength of Materials and Mechanics of Solids that any non-circuital branch student can easily answer. I am saying this because I myself am a Civil Engineer and I applied for the Mechanical Engineering position.\n\n6. Any specific advice you want to give to the junta sitting for placements this year?\n\nMy advice is to not get demotivated or lose hope if you are not selected in any of the initial companies which come because opportunities are always there ahead in your future or fate may call you somewhere where you belong and you will be happy. I also suggest keeping multiple backup options and not relying solely on acquiring a particular position at a particular company but try for multiple companies, write multiple government exams, and also try for an offline recruitment process and never giving up hope.\n\n7. Kindly attach the resume you had during placements (it would be beneficial for the juniors who are looking forward to this role)"

        "content": "Foresight(2022): Placement at Dream11 | Pujan Burad\n\n1) Brief Introduction\n\nHi! My name is Pujan Burad. I am a final year undergraduate student from the department of Metallurgical and Materials Engineering. I am from Malkapur, Maharashtra. I was offered a full-time role as a Software Development Engineer at Dream11 during the campus placement process conducted by CDC.\n\n2) How did you get into Dream 11? What was the selection procedure?\n\nThe selection procedure consisted of 2 stages.\n\nThe first was an online coding assessment(3 questions) of 1 hour and 30 minutes. The questions were of medium-hard difficulty level and were primarily on array and DP. The second was the interview stage which involved 2 technical rounds and 1 HR round. The first technical round focused primarily on data structures and algorithms, and 2\u20133 questions were asked. I had to code the solution on CodePair and explain my approach to the interviewer while optimizing the solution both on time and space.\n\nThe second round was more focused on resume and questions were asked on the work I did during my internship, probability and use case of different data structures. The last round was a culture round with an AVP of the company and HR to check the fit with the company. Basic HR questions and situational-based questions were asked in this round.\n\n3) How to prepare for them?\n\nThe preparation for applying for software roles through CDC is pretty straightforward. The main focus should be on preparing yourself well for the coding rounds. There are courses available online focusing on DSA preparation. Some of them are pretty well structured, so you save a lot of time by not having to search for topics from different places. InterviewBit is a good starting point for the preparation along with Codeforces Ladder.\n\nA few of the things that I found useful during my preparation were:\n\n- Solving Ladders on Codeforces\n\n- Practicing problems on InterviewBit/Leetcode\n\n- Making notes\n\n- Bookmarking questions where you struggled/learned a new concept so you can revisit them later.\n\nFew companies also ask MCQs on OOPS and basic questions from subjects like DBMS, Networks and OS. You can prepare them accordingly from GFG and HackerRank for SQL. Algozenith has a post on how to prepare the CS Fundamentals in great detail: Link to post\n\nIt\u2019s also important to write clean code and not just efficient code. Use of proper variable names and indentation will help in debugging your code faster, with better readability and is a very important aspect in coding interviews.\n\n4) What difficulties did you face while preparing for this Company/Profile? How did you overcome this problem\n\nThe most difficult part is clearing the coding round. A lot of students apply for software roles, so you need to be very good at writing efficient codes quickly. Time becomes an important factor in shortlisting where lots of students have solved all the questions.\n\nA problem I faced not specific to this profile, but in general, was that I started preparing too late. A time period of 3\u20134 months is enough to cover DSA and the basics of CS fundamentals. Coding rounds generally start by September end. Therefore I would suggest starting by June to give you enough time to practice a wide range of questions and cover all the topics.\n\n5) According to you, who should ideally apply for this job?\n\nAnyone who\u2019s good at coding and problem solving, and has a keen interest in software development should apply.\n\n6) Any specific advice you want to give to the junta sitting for placements this year?\n\nPlacements can be very hectic and frustrating. It\u2019s important that you stay in touch with your friends and family. Start early and prepare well. Get your CV reviewed by your friends and seniors. Mock interviews are the best way to ward off nervousness during actual interviews. Stay calm and confident and don\u2019t be disheartened seeing friends get placed early in the season. Rejections are part of the process and learn from them. Your hard work and efforts will pay off in the end. All the best!!"

My name\u2019s Deepanshi Pandey and I am currently pursuing M.Tech(CSE) from IIT Kharagpur. I took part in the placement season of 2021.\n\nHow did you get into Qualcomm software? What was the selection procedure?\n\nThe process had one test followed by three interview rounds. The test had a coding and an aptitude section. The coding questions belonged to the medium to hard category while the aptitude questions were from an easy to medium category.\n\nThe first interview round was a technical round where I was asked about my projects deeply. Then there were questions mostly on operating systems and data structures followed by a medium-level code. The code was to be written on hackerrank and had to pass all the test cases. The second round was conducted within 10 mins of round 1. This also was a technical round which consisted of questions related to system design. They do not expect much during this round from the student and help a lot so that you follow the path correctly towards forming a solution. The third round was the HR round where I was asked situation questions. They also gave me some insights about the company and various teams with which I would have to work.\n\nHow to prepare for them?\n\nFor placements, leetcode is considered one of the best mediums to prepare for coding as it contains concept-based questions and a huge discussion section. The preparation should be started by the end of April. Initially one should start with at least 2\u20133 mediums questions a day. The easy questions help a lot in motivating you initially to continue your preparation consistently so they should also be done along with the medium questions. Gradually you should shift to about 7\u20138 medium questions and a hard question.\n\nCompleting 400+ questions in leetcode would make you confident enough to crack the coding rounds of interviews and tests.\n\nThe preparation should also consist of mock coding tests which are conducted in various coding websites. This should be done at least once per week sincerely.\n\nAlso, a bit of background information about the company can act as a plus point during the interviews.\n\nHow was your experience working from home? What difficulties did you face?\n\nI live in a small village in Uttarakhand where there is no stable internet connection and a lot of electricity issues. I was facing a lot of difficulties during my coursework. So I had to shift to another place where I could give my placement tests and interviews peacefully.\n\nAccording to you, who should ideally apply for this job?\n\nThe students aspiring to work as software developers in the near future should apply for the role. As Qualcomm now wants to extend its software base so there would be a lot to learn with the growth of career in joining the company for an SDE role.\n\nAny specific advice you want to give to the junta sitting for placements this year?\n\nConsistency is the key. Preparation should be done everyday. You should at least complete one question each day even if you want to take a break for that particular day. Also, confidence and good communication skills during interviews are very crucial. Giving mock interviews from various websites or among friends could be good practice."

I did my compulsory internship at Mastercard Technology Private Ltd. during the summer of 2021 . I recently got a SDE campus graduate role offer from Google during the placement season last year.\n\nHow did you get into Google? What was the selection procedure?\n\nI got placed at Google India during the placement season last year. The selection procedure consisted of an online coding contest and 3 rounds of interviews of 45 minutes each. The online contest had two coding questions with one being of easy level and other in medium- hard category which were expected to be solved in 60 minutes. Based on the contest , few students were shortlisted for the interviews. There were 3 interviews in which 2 were purely DSA based and 1 was a mixed DSA and Googlyness round. Google has a special \" Googleyness \" round in which they generally assess candidate's qualities like being a team player, friendly, ethical, respectful , valuing yourself and others . It was about imagining yourself as a Googler and then how you would react to different situations given by the interviewer.\n\nHow to prepare for them?\n\nTo prepare for Software Development Role in Google, one needs to have good knowledge of data structures and algorithms and strong problem solving skills. There is no restriction on programming language. One can choose any language to solve the questions. Google interviews does not focus on advanced data structures and algorithms like Segment trees or Red Black trees or Convex Hull problem although having knowledge of them can give a candidate an edge over others. Interviews question are mostly based on arrays, strings, recursion, geometry, greedy algorithms, dynamic programming, two pointers, binary search, graph algorithms, trie and trees .So it is really important to understand these basic stuff thoroughly before diving into complex data structures and algorithms.\n\nOne should regularly give contests on competitive coding platforms like codeforces, codechef and atcoder. This will help them in improving their speed and problem solving ability. For Interview questions, one must solve InterviewBit questions and then practice standard questions at Leetcode. One positive aspect of Google is that Interviews do not focus on core computer fundamentals like Computer Networks, Operating Systems, Database Management and Computer Architecture so one should expect questions mostly from DSA.\n\nAlso, one needs to have a good understanding of the time complexity of different algorithms .Apart from these technical details, speed is also important since one needs to explain the solution approach to the interviewer and code it in the limited time given. The interviewee is expected to write a error free code with proper function names and comments. I even earned extra points due to my speed and clean code in one of my interviews. Giving few mock interviews before actual interview would be of great help.\n\nAccording to you, who should ideally apply for this job?\n\nAn ideal person to apply for this role would be one who has passion for technology and wants his/her work to affect millions of lives because of the huge Google user-base. He/She will get to work with some of the best minds in the industry.\n\nThe work culture at Google is one of the most healthy and fun work environment in the industry. The company invests a lot in the growth of its employees and cares immensely about the employees. One of the unique rule in Google is \u201c80\u201320\u201d rule. This means that employees are encouraged to spend 80% of their time on the core projects and the rest 20% on innovation activities that peak their own personal interests. This greatly helps employees to keep learning and growing.\n\nAny specific advice you want to give to the junta sitting for placements this year?\n\nAn advice I would like to give to my juniors is that don\u2019t cram a concept but understand it .This will help in solving even tricky and slightly twisted standard questions generally asked by Google. Moreover, please think out loud and communicate with the interviewer. The interviewer needs to know your thought process during the interview. And lastly, have confidence in yourself and give your best during those 45 minutes.\n\nThis is my LinkedIn profile : https://www.linkedin.com/in/vinay612agarwal/\n\nThis contains almost everything academic about my college life. Anyone can connect with me here if he/she has any doubt to clarify."

What was the selection procedure?\n\nI was placed through campus placements.\n\nSo the first step was to submit a resume for Microsoft through ERP and then also we were shared a google form to fill out our details and rating on any coding platform like CodeForces or CodeChef.\n\nAfter this, all the students with having CG greater than or equal to 7.5 received an online test link.\n\nThe test was conducted on codility platform where copy-pasting was allowed even from outside sources, so you can solve questions on your personal IDE and can copy-paste on the codility editor.\n\nThere were 2 coding questions and the test duration was 90 minutes\n\nAfter it, about 45 students got shortlisted for an interview that was to be conducted on Day 1 i.e 1st Dec\n\nThere were 3 interview rounds. The first two were technical and the last one was HR.\n\nTechnical rounds were quite average in difficulty, where I was given some standard problems to solve, code, and explain the solution to the interviewer.\n\nIn the HR round, he told me to ask questions to him. I asked three questions to him regarding the company only and he gave very elaborated answers. After it, I got a call that I have an offer from Microsoft.\n\nHow to prepare for them?\n\nEverybody has a different preparation strategy. I will discuss my own.\n\nI have seen that Microsoft doesn\u2019t ask very difficult questions, neither in coding tests nor in technical interviews. So having enough practice with standard questions can lead you to get an offer here. You can solve questions in order of likes on Leetcode i.e from most liked as they are generally standard and Important questions to solve. You can follow this link\n\nLeetCode\n\nI started my preparation when I was not able to secure a CDC internship. so I had about 8 months to prepare for placements and prior to it, I had not much experience in coding. I started practicing from Leetcode only and used to do questions in a time-bound manner. On average, I did 3 questions daily and I think it is enough if you are consistent.\n\nTo improve my rating on Codeforces, I used to attend contests. I finally was able to have about 1550 rating and I think this much is okayish.\n\nMy primary focus was still Leetcode and I used to attend only contests on Codeforces.\n\nI also started doing Interviewbit when the interviews were near. and I think it is very very important to have gone through every question on Interviewbit. In the 2nd round of my interview, both of the questions asked were from the Array section of Interviewbit. So doing Interviewbit is a must.\n\nOther important things for interviews are OOP concepts and OOD design questions as nowadays many companies are asking about OOD.So having some experience in it will definitely help you\n\nThe basics of OS and CN are also important. And should be done before you appear for the interview.\n\nAccording to you, who should ideally apply for this job?\n\nAnyone who likes to solve problems and code them. Even if you don\u2019t have internship experience in the development field, you can still go for it.\n\nAny specific advice you want to give to the junta sitting for placements this year?\n\nI think getting a placement is not at all a very difficult thing to do. I was not able to secure a CDC internship. So if you have not gotten a CDC internship, don\u2019t get disappointed. Just be consistent, keep doing and improving and you will come off with flying colors."

        "content": "FORESIGHT(2022): Placement at Google| Tias Mondal\n\nBrief Introduction\n\nMy name is Tias Mondal, I am a final year dual degree student in the Department of Electronics and Electrical Communication Engineering, IIT Kharagpur. I have done my internship in Honeywell Technology Solutions Lab and am currently placed at Google.\n\nHow did you get into Google? What was the selection procedure?\n\nThe selection process of a software company is standard. They conduct, an online coding test first which consists of around two to four questions to be solved in a stipulated time and after that you have your three to four rounds of interviews. The interview basically judges you on your problem-solving skills and logical reasoning, so they test you on data structures and algorithms related skills and then if you are applying for some specific roles, then they may ask you CS core fundamental concepts like operating system, DBMS, networking etc. Not all companies ask all of the things that I mentioned, but DSA is necessary for software roles. So, the general template of any software interview is, DSA along with some CSE core fundamental concepts. But here Google is an exception. For new graduate roles, Google only asks DSA questions, no CS fundamental concept is asked and Google also makes this very clear from the beginning that they will only ask DSA questions. So that is all about it.\n\nNow, if I talk specifically about Google, Google has a very well-known template for new graduates SWE roles, so you have a sharp 45 to 50 minutes interview and within that duration you will be given one algorithmic question and you have to code it out and explain each and every part that you are writing. One thing that I will add here is that one beautiful thing about Google interviews is that most of the problems revolve around real world scenarios that Google engineers face in the actual software engineering roles. So, though they are DSA problems to be solved using some existing algorithms, they are real world engineering problems.\n\nComing to my interview rounds, in my first round, I was given a slightly challenging question based on trees and strings. If you can solve the question quickly, you can be asked one more question based on the amount of time available. Since I did that quickly, I was asked another question based on tree. That is where the round ended.\n\nIn the second round, I was again given a real-world engineering-based problem based on disjoint set union data structure. Initially I came up with a non-optimal solution and then had numerous discussions with the interviewer in optimizing the approach. Make sure while writing a solution, you find the corner cases or the cases in which the solution would fail rather than the interviewer doing that for you, we (Me and the interviewer) had discussion on various edge cases, time complexities, etc. The interviewer was super friendly and we also had discussions about different sectors at Google, about the work culture at Google, and that is where the round ended.\n\nIn my third round I was given a fairly easy question as compared to the other rounds which needed to be solved using maps. I did that quickly and after that again a fairly simple DP plus graph question, which is also a very standard one. The second part of this interview was the HR round of Google. The HR questions were also standard about what challenges you have faced in real life and all.\n\nHow to prepare for them?\n\nI would say, practice a lot of data structure and algorithm questions and if someone can do competitive coding, he or she will surely have an upper hand over others. Most of the companies ask DSA questions, but there are few selected companies like Google, media.net, Code Nation, Uber. These companies ask more competitive coding level questions rather than the standard leetcode type DSA questions. Do Codeforces rounds, They\u2019re super helpful. Try to solve till Code forces C to D level questions, these rounds will make your implementation super-fast and help you to clear almost every coding round. If anyone has time, I would ask you to go for Codeforces and Codechef, and when closer to your interviews and coding rounds, do leetcode. If you are well versed with your competitive coding, leetcode will be easier for you. If you are not able to come up with a solution, try to look into the editorial and this technique will help you further, If you get some similar question in future.\n\nAccording to you, who should ideally apply for this job?\n\nAnyone can apply for this job. The only requirement is strong problem-solving skills (Not only coding), Which I think a student can master in a year or so, given that he puts in a lot of effort and dedication towards his aim.\n\nAny specific advice you want to give to the junta sitting for placements this year.\n\nHere one suggestion that I would like to give to the students regarding the interviews is that just try to communicate your ideas clearly to the interviewer. It is your responsibility to make sure that your interviewer understands every line of code that you write. Also do not be quiet while writing code, explain each line, if possible, write brief comments in places you feel are complicated. Write meaningful variable names and clean code. All these points are particularly important because unlike many other companies, Google has a hiring committee which is formed by Google engineers who reviews the codes. So, the code that you will write will be reviewed by at least three Google engineers before your final decision on selection or rejection is made, which implies your code is your identity to the people in the hiring committee, so it should be clean and presentable and also try to make implementation faster. As for Google, the interviewer will not allow you extra time more than 45 minutes even if you have unfinished code. Try writing code, even if it is a brute force solution. You can optimize that later through discussion with the interviewer.\n\nI will just suggest the students who are preparing for the software roles to just PRACTICE & PRACTICE. Practice is the single most important key, so if you have time, do competitive coding. Do some hard \u2014 medium leetcode questions. and aim for the best and do not get demotivated in between, because in this field of competitive coding it is quite easy to get demotivated. So just try to make a group of friends who do competitive coding, together discuss solutions after contests, look into the editorials, and try to know the techniques. Even if you are not able to solve the question, try to know the techniques as these techniques will help you if a similar question comes, so practice is the key thing that you need to do if you are aiming for any role."

        "content": "FORESIGHT(2022): Placement at AlphaGrep| Satyam Sharma\n\nBrief Introduction\n\nI\u2019m Satyam Sharma. I am a final year undergraduate student pursuing my major in Mathematics and Computing at Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur. I was born and brought up in Chittaranjan, West Bengal.\n\nPreviously, I have interned with Mastercard as a software developer in the Data and Services Platform team. Post my second year, I also got an opportunity to work as a research and development intern at Centre for Artificial Intelligence and Robotics, Defence Research & Development Organisation (DRDO). Besides, I love exploring systems with a deep passion for Operating Systems.\n\nHow did you get into AlphaGrep? What was the selection procedure?\n\nI got placed at AlphaGrep through on-campus placement (CDC). It consists of one Online Assessment Round followed by one to two rounds of technical interviews.\n\nOnline Assessment: This is purely based on Data Structures and Algorithms. One can expect non trivial questions ranging from moderate to advanced level problems.\n\nHow to prepare for them?\n\nFor DSA, it is highly recommended to consistently appear for online contests. Not only can one improve their problem solving skill but also learn to solve problems within a given time frame, which from the placement point of view is perhaps the most important thing.\n\nI also relied upon leetcode for topic wise problem solving. I used to give 5\u20136 hours daily to solve roughly 7\u20138 problems a day. I used to re-solve a problem if my runtime was less than 40% and later used to refer to the best solution. This gave me an opportunity to learn alternative methods, new techniques and algorithms. Apart from this, I was blessed to have a mentor who was my hall senior. Everyday I used to discuss tough problems with him. To my juniors, get yourself a partner who might be your friend, senior or even junior. It isn\u2019t possible to solve every problem and preparation of DSA is time consuming. Everyday you can discuss the tough problems amongst yourself. This way you can solve twice the number of problems you would have solved otherwise.\n\nComing to topics from Core Computer Science, I followed my lecture notes. For reference material, I followed video lectures of Prof. Sorav Bansal, IIT Delhi for Operating Systems. Similarly for Computer Networks, one can refer to video lectures of Prof. Sandip Chakraborty, IITKGP and the book Computer Networks by Andrew S. Tanenbaum. For Computer Architecture, topics like Caching and Pipeline are extremely crucial and I followed video lectures by Prof Smruti Ranjan Sarangi, IIT Delhi. Other platforms like MIT OCW, Stanford Online are also a great place for students who are preparing for these topics.\n\nFor C++, learncpp.com is a great resource which discusses topics till implementation level.\n\nWhat difficulties did you face while preparing for this Company/Profile? How did you overcome this problem.\n\nWith a CGPA of 7.95 during my CDC internship, I faced multiple rejections as most of the companies in the initial days had a bar 8+ which obviously was extremely discouraging. For this reason, I focused on my academics a bit more for the next two semesters to make sure I crossed the bar. Though, for placements, this criteria is a little bit relaxed but again, the more the better.\n\nApart from this, the entire period of preparation is extremely monotonous and sometimes depressing. You have a lot to cover for placements along with managing your academics and Thesis Project. Also, I started my preparations from mid of July and placement tests started from the second week of October. So, with such a small time frame, it was difficult to cover the entire syllabus. Therefore I started group study with my batchmates during the month of November to prepare for topics which are comparatively less important from an interview point of view like Compilers, so that I could invest more time in other important topics. This turned out to be a good decision for me and helped me cover breadth quickly. Also throughout this period, being surrounded by my family, friends and seniors was an added support.\n\nAccording to you, who should ideally apply for this job?\n\nBased upon my experience of the industry, I am not sure if I would be the right person for this question, for me I don\u2019t have any first hand experience right now. In my case, I am really passionate about Software Development. Since my second year I developed a deep interest in Systems. I started kernel development in my third year. This introduced me to low level programming and eventually to some techniques for writing faster applications. Therefore, based upon the interactions with my seniors who work in the same industry I got to know that this role somewhat aligns with my interest, that it would give me an opportunity for further exploration. Working as a software developer in an HFT based organisation with like minded on systems where nanoseconds matters, gives one the exposure how stuff actually works under the hood and an opportunity to learn and write low latency codes. Therefore, HFT was on my preference list.\n\nAny specific advice you want to give to the junta sitting for placements this year.\n\nAs mentioned before, this period is going to be stressful and emotionally draining. Take this as an opportunity to develop your hard and soft skills. Don\u2019t stress over getting rejected in the OA rounds. Your performance in OA is a part of selection criteria which otherwise contains many other parameters. Just realise your mistake and work on it. During my placement, I realised many of us have imposter syndrome. We tend to judge ourselves based upon peers\u2019 preparation and their past achievements which directly or indirectly our confidence and plays a key role in placing ourselves in the rejection list. What really matters is your knowledge, your sincerity and dedication. Everyone is going to start from zero. Don\u2019t extrapolate your past, at the end how well you have prepared, how well you can defend your work and CV and how you have leveraged your college time would be the X-factor. Be confident and fight till the end. Placements don\u2019t decide your fate, and I have witnessed multiple examples of my seniors who weren\u2019t initially placed in their so-called dream companies and now grabbing multiple offers from top tech companies who once rejected them, thus bearing the testimony of this fact. Campus placement is just like an opportunity you get in your final year to get a headstart in your career, nothing more nothing less."

I am also the CSE department representative for the academic year 2021\u201322.\n\nHow did you get into Quadeye? What was the selection procedure?\n\nI got into Quadeye (Quant role) through CDC placements. The selection procedure is quite standard. First you have a test on IQ questions. Then on Day-1, they have multiple rounds of interviews.\n\nHow to prepare for them?\n\nhttps://brainstellar.com/ and Heard on the street are two great resources to improve your quant.

        "content": "FORESIGHT(2022): Placement at Zomato | Vishvesh Pandya\n\nBrief Introduction\n\nHey, I am Vishvesh Pandya, a fifth-year undergrad in the Department of Mining Engineering. I am from Ahmedabad, Gujarat. I will be joining Zomato as an Associate Product Manager.\n\nHow did you get into Zomato? What was the selection procedure?\n\nOverall, there were two rounds during the placement session 20221\u201322 for Zomato. For most of the companies that come for the product roles(APM), the first round is generally deck submission, but for Zomato, it was different. First-round was the online test which consisted of two parts:\n\nAround 20 students were shortlisted and there was only one round of Interviews which lasted for 1\u20131.5 hours. Questions asked during the round were:\n\nAdvice: They prefer the candidates to have a genuine discussion and not act too formally. During my Interview, after initial 5\u201310 mins, the Interviewer told me that I was being too formal in the way of talking and in dressing sense. He told me to remove the tie and blazer, be in a bit chill mode, and have a very normal conversation instead of the typical setup we follow during the placement Interviews.\n\nHow to prepare for them?\n\nProduct Management is a new role; the first and foremost thing is understanding what product management is and why you want to go into the product management field. Once having clarity on that, you can start preparing for the same and the process seems relatable.\n\nMost of the companies that visit campus during placements for product roles have majorly two rounds:\n\nDeck Submission:\n\nHere, the key to mastering is just practice and practice. Start participating in various online product case competitions and eventually, it will help in learning how to make a good deck. The deck size varies from company to company, but it will be mainly between 4 to 10 pages and keep that in mind while you practice. Some competitions you can refer to are PM school weekly challenge, ProductFolks \u201cProduct Teardown\u201d, ProductFiniti case competitions, etc.\n\nPoints to keep in mind for the deck:\n\nProduct Case Round:\n\nFind a group of 3 people (minimum) to practice cases as each will have a different point of view towards the same situation and will help improve the thought process.\n\nBefore you start with product cases, it is advisable to begin with consult cases as it helps understand the basic things that revolve around case solving. Here, majorly there are 4\u20135 types of product cases that are asked at an APM/Product Analyst level:\n\nHere, start with RCA first, as it will help in learning how to define a problem, break a problem, and structure your overall thoughts. After this, start with product thinking cases by identifying the apps/problems you face in your daily life. At last, if you have sufficient time, then go through the other cases as well, which were mentioned above.\n\nVarious online resources which will help in preparation are as follows:\n\nYoutube Channels:\n\nWebsite:\n\nBooks:\n\nThe most basic questions asked in the Interviews are what product management is and why product management. At the first look, these questions seem simple, but the Interviewer puts a lot of effort into understanding the core reason and motivation. So, do focus on these questions as well.\n\nWhat difficulties did you face while preparing for this Company/Profile? How did you overcome this problem?\n\nTo speak honestly, at every point during the preparation phase, you will face different challenges and there is no ideal way to deal with them. You have to find your own way and keep moving forward.\n\nOne of the major problems that I faced after seeing a lot of mock Interviews on youtube channels and reading books was that I got very mechanical in solving the cases, and it looked like I was following specific steps and answering to that only. This doesn\u2019t look good from the Interviewer\u2019s perspective as the candidate has just mugged up the steps and followed that only. Even the worst part was that all the friends I was practicing with were also doing the same thing and we didn\u2019t notice that it was a mistake. It got identified when I did the first case with my Flipkart Buddy once I was shortlisted after the deck round. So, to overcome that, you have to create your own structure for every type of case you do and keep improving it from the inputs you get from different people instead of just following the set method given in the books or online resources. One month of preparation during Flipkart Buddy sessions has been the best learning experience for me and it boosted my confidence through ample practice. If you need help with that, you can further contact me and I would be happy to help with that.\n\nThe other problem that I faced during the initial days was finding a partner with whom I could dedicatedly solve the cases. At that time, most of the people are looking for more than 3\u20134 profiles in the placements and won\u2019t be able to dedicate that much to the practice. During this time, I came across the \u201cStellar peers\u201d website and it helped me find like-minded people. In this website, go to Practice -> Mock -> Link Calendar. Once you link your calendar, you will be able to see the community along with their desired timing slots for mocks. Even you can also create your slots and connect with people to practice cases.\n\nAccording to you, who should ideally apply for this job?\n\nOne of the best and worst things about this role is that it doesn\u2019t require any specific skills or degrees. As far as I have seen and heard, most companies don\u2019t look for the things like department, CG, POR, etc. as well, so it\u2019s open to all. You show your skills and ideas through the deck and get shortlisted without any other factors affecting it. And same goes for the Interviews as well; show your skills at the moment and get the job.\n\nThe core of product management revolves around solving user problems. And to do this, you will be working with a different set of people from different teams having diverse skillsets. And obviously, you can\u2019t be an expert in each of them. Also, the work is very dynamic, i.e., one day, you will be roaming around to talk to users, and on other days you will be explaining CEO about a new product that will change the face of a company. So, one thing that will help deal with all the diverse challenges is just being curious. If you are curious enough, you will be able to learn things at a time. So, those who are curious, who want an everyday challenge, who like taking ownership of things, and who like to influence people without authority should ideally apply for the role.\n\nAny specific advice you want to give to the junta sitting for placements this year.\n\nThe most important thing to crack the placements is to stick to your own goals. There will be a lot of hassle going around you during that time, like tests, shortlists, people changing their profiles, companies not coming, etc. It\u2019s a part of the process, it will come and go. Do not compare with others, be confident, prepare well and believe in yourself. Also, keep in touch with at least one friend who is not from IIT KGP who will help you calm yourself and with whom you can have normal discussions. Because during that time, the atmosphere gets a little toxic and competitive as most people will be in a placement race.\n\nOne thing for the folks who are preparing for product roles, start practicing the cases as soon as you can because there is no alternative to learning case-solving apart from practice. Many times you will feel after seeing the mock videos that \u201cAree yaar\u2026Yeh to Kar lunga (I will be able to do it)\u201d but trust me, until and unless you don\u2019t do it on your own, you won\u2019t be able to identify and undo your mistakes.\n\nKeep Calm. Machake. All the Best!"

I sat for campus placements and got an offer from Zomato in their Engineering team as a Product Engineer.\n\nHow did you get into Zomato? What was the selection procedure?\n\nZomato visited our campus and offered 4 profiles vis Core Engineer, Product Engineer, Business Analyst and Associate Product Manager. Core Engineering and Product Engineering profiles were basically Software Development Engineering Profiles. First, we had a Coding assessment, wherein we were asked 4 questions and they had to be solved within an hour. People from all the departments with CGPA > 7.5 were allowed to take the test. Those questions were of medium difficulty level.\n\nThen a form was floated wherein we were asked to fill in some of our experiences in Coding, Ratings in various Competitive Programming sites and our Github profile. Around 20\u201330 people were shortlisted for the final interview which was to happen on Day 2 of campus placements.\n\nThe interview consisted of only one round. This round was mainly focused on data structures and algorithms; I was asked to explain one of the projects that were listed on my resume, and some discussions on that followed. I was asked some questions on my internship project and CS topics were also asked. This interview lasted nearly 1.5 hours. There was no HR round as such.\n\nHow to prepare for them?\n\nI would recommend solving coding problems from websites like Codeforces, Codechef, Hackerearth, etc. this certainly would give an edge to the problem-solving skills that are generally asked for this profile in various companies. While interviewing, communicate your thoughts effectively and use the hints provided by the interviewer along the way. And do discuss the approach with the interviewer and start coding only when the interviewer seems to understand your approach and agrees about the same.\n\nDo go through important CS topics like OOPS, OS, DBMS and try to learn SQL, this definitely would help along the way.\n\nPrepare the CV real well, make sure you know every bit of the stuff that\u2019s written on the CV, and can confidently answer any questions asked from the CV.\n\nThough there was no HR round for me in Zomato, preparing the HR questions beforehand is important as well.\n\nLastly, put a smile on your face and even if you are under immense pressure (which you would be) make sure you keep your calm.\n\nHow would you describe the work culture in your company? How is the work-life balance?\n\nNot sure about this! Yet to embark upon this journey and discover the culture at Zomato. With the understanding I have, I feel Zomato has a very open culture and a lot has been going on at Zomato lately, so I sort of expect to work on pretty exciting stuff ahead.\n\nHow was your experience working from home? What difficulties did you face?\n\nWhile on campus, we would have gotten a chance to prepare along with friends which would have been a big plus.\n\nImminent network issues while working at home has been a big issue.\n\nAccording to you, who should ideally apply for this job?\n\nAnyone who is inclined towards pursuing a career in tech should consider this. They don\u2019t really bother about the department, so everyone can apply.\n\nAny specific advice you want to give to the junta sitting for placements this year\n\nCampus Placements is going to be a pretty hectic affair. Please refrain from Overthinking. It\u2019s always beneficial to form a group of 3\u20134 friends targeting similar profiles and prepare together for the placements.\n\nDon\u2019t be afraid of rejections, prepare well for stuff you have ahead of you. Don\u2019t blindly apply to any and every profile, rather target a profile or two and prepare for those meticulously.\n\nDo practice communicating your thoughts effectively, which is very crucial. Have some mock interview sessions, and prepare your CV really really well.\n\nGet in touch with some seniors and make sure you get your CV reviewed by them. Give it your best and leave the rest!\n\nRest assured all this gonna make sense in the end.\n\nWishing you guys all the best!"

The quant section was compulsory, while one could choose to attempt either one or both of the rest two sections. Around 65 students were shortlisted for interviews for the Management Trainee profile through this test.\n\nInterview Round 1 (eliminating):\n\nIt started with a CV walkthrough and follow-up questions regarding previous internships and projects, followed by a root cause analysis and strategy case.\n\nInterview Round 2:\n\nThis round consisted of multiple short cases and questions based upon the credit card system and its workings, with an emphasis on aspects like customer risk profiling, the business model of credit card networking companies, and credit fraud detection.

My name is Prakhar Gaur, and I am a final year undergraduate student from the Department of Civil Engineering enrolled in its dual degree course. I am from Delhi and will be joining as Associate Product Manager (APM) at BlinkIt (formerly Grofers) this year after my graduation. I appreciate this initiative of SWG to help the students with their career ambitions and am looking forward to sharing my experiences here.\n\nHow did you get into Grofers? What was the selection procedure?\n\nI got into Grofers through the CDC placement process in the academic year 2021\u20132022.\n\nThe selection procedure here consisted broadly of 2 stages-\n\nThe most important tip here is to be confident and take it forward as a discussion that involves both the interview and interviewee who are trying to solve a problem together (with a smile on their face :p)\n\nHow to prepare for them?\n\nTo put it concisely, preparation for product management requires a blend of creativity, aptitude for problem-solving, good communication skills, some product/tech awareness, and some experience. Let us see them one by one-\n\nCreativity and problem-solving- In the PM interview, generally three types of problems are asked- 1) Root Cause Analysis (For eg. How to solve the problem of Uber witnessing a decline in the number of ride bookings on its app) 2) Product Thinking Cases (For eg. Designing Netflix for kids) and 3) Market Entry case (For eg. How to go about introducing Spotify in India) for a given product. These problems can be practiced in a group by solving some cases from books like Cracking the PM Interview and Preparing for Product Interviews by IIT Madras and/or watching Youtube channels like PM School, Exponent etc. Preparation for consulting interviews helps a lot here, as it was in my case. Make sure to form groups with similarly motivated PM enthusiasts for practicing the cases.\n\nGood communication skills are required for all the interviews but more for frontend roles like a PM. A product manager is expected to liaise with different teams and bring them on the same page to achieve the objectives more efficiently. A clear, concise communication is thus required from the PM\u2019s end. For this, one can try polishing their soft skills by participating in different speaking events/competitions and learning the basics of group discussions and interviews\n\nProduct/tech-related awareness- Staying updated with product-related news, especially for the product of the company you\u2019re interviewing for) is really helpful. For instance, I was asked about what modifications I could suggest to the existing app of Grofers. Further, some basic tech awareness like how WhatsApp work and some key technical terms can prove to be beneficial. You can follow product-related blogs or tech news regularly for it.\n\nFinally, some experience- Having prior PM internships/startup experiences will definitely strengthen your candidature during the interview and give you an idea of the role\u2019s demands. This will also help you make an informed decision on whether you really want to go for it or not. In my case, my startup experience (I had previously worked on a startup named as SmallPaw) actually helped me a lot since I had not done any PM internship before. I had mentioned it on my CV, and many questions were asked on it, all of which I could comfortably answer.\n\nOverall, the preparation for product management interviews generally takes only a couple of months and even less if you have done consulting preparation before (as was in my case). One should look forward to doing related internships if sufficient time is left before the placements.\n\nHow would you describe the work culture in your company? How is the work-life balance?\n\nI am not in the best position to answer this since I am yet to start the work. However, generally speaking, PM-related roles require a good no. of hours of work every day (varies from company to company) with a lot of interaction and communication with different teams. However, that can never be an issue if you actually love this role!\n\nAccording to you, who should ideally apply for this job?\n\nIdeally, people who like business problem solving, interacting with different people, and thinking out of the box should apply.\n\nHaving said this, even if you have a slight interest in major products/apps across the world and like generalist roles more, you can consider going for it.\n\nAny specific advice you want to give to the junta sitting for placements this year\n\nThe best advice would be to stay confident and believe in yourself. You still have a lot of time (trust me, a lot of time!) if you are focused enough for the placements (for the non-tech roles like consulting, PM, etc). If you have more than 4\u20135 months remaining before the placements, you can go for an internship (if you don\u2019t have one in your field of interest) and start some preparation parallelly. You can go full-fledged only in the last few months. In addition, do not try to target all the fields. Choosing two fields (one as primary and one as backup) and giving your best for them is always better than preparing a bit for all the fields. Try sticking to them only even if you start doubting yourself during the placement process. This is one thing that certainly helped me.\n\nAlso, I know that it is a difficult phase for anyone but remember, you are not the only one who is facing this (even the brightest ones, from your perspective). So take it as a natural process, stay healthy and also chill a bit to keep your mind free from stress.\n\nAll the very best for your placements, Kgp junta!"

Finally, they released a shortlist of around 25 students for the group interview (which consists of 2 interviewers and 3 candidates in each panel) following which the HR round was conducted with the further shortlisted candidates.\n\nHow to prepare for them?\n\nAs such it's difficult to find resources for psychometric tests, but there are a few websites that can give you some insights. Mostly, it's something you have to do during the test itself. And behavioral + situation-based questions can be answered by using your presence of mind, your understanding of the concerned domain and practical knowledge. You can try to find something online based on the job description on ERP. In the group interview, the questions they ask are supposed to be answered in such a way that you have to cite a situation from your experience and explain what you did in the essence of the question. Try to be as concise as possible and answer each question within 2\u20133 minutes on average. Beating around the bush won\u2019t help you much. And if they have further questions or they are unclear about something, they\u2019ll attempt to clarify the same. The other type of questions that they ask usually is wherein you\u2019ve to assume yourself in a given position and try to find possible solutions to the problem with the given set of constraints. In this, you can make valid assumptions but be sure to check with them.\n\nWhat difficulties did you face while preparing for this Company/Profile? How did you overcome this problem?\n\nAs such, I didn\u2019t encounter any issues. I had experience with team/project management since I was the team manager of TeamKART. So, I was familiar with the relevant things.\n\nAccording to you, who should ideally apply for this job?\n\nFMCGs usually look for people who have techno-managerial experience in the past because the job requires you to understand the technicalities, come up with a solution and then execute the same using the resources available to you. So, if you think you\u2019re good with the fundamentals of your branch and you know to manage things efficiently while being in charge, you should apply for such roles.\n\nAny specific advice you want to give to the junta sitting for placements this year?\n\nThe overall process starting from tests, shortlisting and interviews is very unpredictable. You never know why something happened the way it did. But keep fighting, no matter what. Make a group of friends who are targeting profiles similar to you and collaborate on the preparation. Ask your batchmates/seniors to conduct mock interviews towards the end of November, acknowledge their feedback, and act on them. Be confident about every little detail that you have mentioned in your resume. If you think your communication skills aren\u2019t up to the mark, then work towards this. There are a ton of videos online to help you out. And lastly, take as much help as possible from your peers and be in touch with others to prevent yourself from missing any deadline. Managing academics is also tricky but you have to do it anyhow. You\u2019re in one of the best institutions in the country and you\u2019ve worked hard in the last 3/4 years. Now, you just have to assimilate your experience and present it in an attractive fashion, that\u2019s it! Feel free to reach out to me or anyone else for anything that you need. All the best!!! Machake!\n\nWhat are some of the major points you think would be valid to mention while targeting this profile?\n\nThey look for technically sound individuals who are capable of efficient decision-making as a manager. So, try to add relevant things to your CV that can help them relate to what they are looking for. In my opinion, hardcore research experience which is not relevant to the industry is something you can think of not mentioning. However, if you think whatever you\u2019ve done has industrial applications, then go ahead."

I am from Visakhapatnam, Andhra Pradesh. I will be joining BNY Mellon as a Software Developer.\n\nSelection procedure\n\nThe screening test consisted only of coding questions. Three coding questions were given and a time of 90 minutes was given in total. The questions were of medium difficulty from the topics Arrays, Graphs, and a hard problem from the topic Dp+Bitmasking. The students who solved all three got shortlisted.\n\nThe interview consisted of three rounds (2 Technical + 1 HR). The first round consisted of just 2 coding questions and I had to solve them in the Hacker rank platform where we had Run tests and submit options just like the screening test but here we had to code in front of the interviewer and explain him. The questions were easy to moderate level. The second round was also similar to the first round and consisted of 2 coding questions with a different interviewer but on the same platform. One question was moderate and one question was easy. I solved all four of them. The last round was an HR round with basic HR questions and some puzzles, which were quite easy.\n\nHow to prepare for them?\n\nFirstly, one has to be clear with all the concepts of Data Structures and Algorithms to get into a software developer role. The best platform to start DSA is Interviewbit. After solving Interviewbit fully start practicing in Leetcode, write weekly contests, and take as many mock contests as possible because writing the whole code and debugging under a time limit is very important and Leetcode provides a platform for Mock Contests. One more website which I found very useful was BinarySearch.com, which consisted of many good questions. I had a group of friends with whom I practiced coding so we used to start a mock contest with only hard questions, if anyone of us solved the questions everyone else would be able to see it in between the contest, so it became very competitive. Once you get a good hold on the concepts of DSA and solve many questions you can move to Codeforces or Codechef and start solving questions from there.\n\nWhat difficulties did you face while preparing for this Company/Profile? How did you overcome this problem?\n\nOne of the major problems in getting into a software developer role is competition. Getting shortlisted in companies would be tough even after solving all the questions one might not get shortlisted. To overcome this problem one has to give as many mock tests as possible so that one gets used to writing code within the timeframe, and also having a good CGPA and a good resume with decent projects is always an added advantage in getting shortlisted but not necessary. Having great coding skills is the most important factor to get into the Software Developer role.\n\nWho should ideally apply for this job?\n\nAnyone who has a passion for technology, interested in Fin-Tech and targets Software Developer Role can apply for this job\n\nWhat advice will you give to them?\n\nPlacement time is very hectic and people feel very frustrating but trust me all the hard work that you have put in will definitely give you results. Try to stay as calm and composed as possible during the interviews. Do good preparation and be confident, your preparation will definitely bring you great results. I would suggest everyone to form a group for practicing coding because I have learned many concepts while discussing with my friends, trust me you will learn many concepts when there is a group with the same passion to solve the questions. Don\u2019t get disheartened seeing your friends getting placed on Day 0 or Day 1, your time will come. ALL THE BEST!!!!"

This was followed by a screening test which consisted of two parts.- Paper 1 MCQ Test consisting of 30 Questions to be completed in 35 minutes (1 mark for correct answer, -0.25 mark for incorrect answer)There were 3 sections:Section 1: Maths (5 Q)Section 2: Probability(14 Q)Section 3: Coding MCQ(11 Q)- Paper 2 Coding test consisting of 2 questions to be solved in 60 minutes.The maths questions were of JEE level from calculus, trigonometry, geometry, and linear algebra. The probability questions were of medium-hard level and the final coding MCQs were easy. The 2 coding questions were also easy-medium difficulty level.Around 30 students were shortlisted and there were 3 rounds of technical interviews, followed by an HR round.First-round was quant, with several questions on probability and statistics. There were many questions on concepts of expected value, linearity of expectation and probability distributions. Clearing this round is most crucial.\n\nThe second round was focused on my CV, and the interview was mainly on the work I had done for my B.Tech Thesis. Several related questions were asked to ensure I had a solid understanding of the option pricing project I did for my thesis. A few questions were also asked on my previous summer internship project.The third was a coding round with a few questions again on my summer intern project and a few questions related to data structures.\n\nHow to prepare for them?\n\nFor Quant, I mostly prepared 50 Challenging problems in probability and Xinfeng Zhou.\n\nYou need to practice solving problems fast, aiming to solve each question in approx 1\u20131.5 min.\n\nBrainstellar is also good for probability practice. Coding questions asked are mostly easy-medium level and revising questions from interviewbit helps. Apart from that, I was asked a few questions on basic c++ concepts, and some questions on oops.I was also asked some basic questions on stochastic calculus \u2014 what is Brownian motion, the notion of volatility in the Black Scholes model, volatility smile etc.\n\nWhat difficulties did you face while preparing for this Company/Profile? How did you overcome this problem?\n\nOne of the major hurdles was clearing the initial screening test which requires you to solve 30 quant+coding MCQs in 35 minutes.\n\nUnless you have sufficient practice solving questions with time boundedness, you won\u2019t be able to complete the test and score well.\n\nSo it\u2019s important to time yourself while solving probability questions. Try to do mock tests to improve your speed of solving.\n\nWho should ideally apply for this job?\n\nAnyone who has an interest in math and is good at coding would find this role really interesting and rewarding.\n\nWhat advice will you give to them?\n\nPlacements can be really hectic and emotionally draining. It is very important to stay calm and keep working hard even when you face rejections.\n\nBe confident and have faith in the process."

I am from Hyderabad, Telangana.\n\nSelection procedure\n\nI got selected in Qualcomm systems \u2014 RFIC profile in CDC placement drive.\n\nComing to the Qualcomm selection procedure, I have first applied via ERP and then they have conducted a test initially. Every student had to attempt 2 compulsory sections (Aptitude + Programming Basics), post which candidates need to select one among the following 4 sections. (Digital, SW, ML, Communication). Hardware- Digital QP (Digital), Software- SW QP (Computer Science), Machine Learning Systems \u2014 ML QP (Machine Learning), Modem, Firmware, Platform Architecture, RFIC, Multimedia system \u2014 Communication QP (Communication).\n\nLater, based on our score in the test and our CV, shortlisted people were allotted 10 different panels where each panel belongs to a specific profile like Software, RFIC, etc. As far as I know, no student was shortlisted for more than one profile.\n\nOn 30th November 2021, interviews started at 5 PM. For me, there were 2 technical rounds each roughly 50\u201360 min. The interview was mostly based on Analog electronics, Communication courses, and Design aspects of analog and digital. By 10 PM, roughly all interviews were done. On the 1st December 2021 evening, results were announced.\n\nHow to prepare for them?\n\nFirstly, aptitude and basic programming are common for all the profiles. There will be moderate to tough questions from them in the test. Try to contact people who have given Qualcomm tests in CDC for Internships or Placements in the previous year to know the trend of questions in a particular profile.\n\nDecide on which profiles you want to target for your career and its always better to target more than one profile. There will be subtopics related to each Job description describing the required prerequisites.\n\nThen collect the required material from EE & EECE courses, NPTEL courses and Famous courses like Razavi lectures.

I was a student of the Mechanical Engineering Department, enrolled in its B-Tech Course. The major Extra-curricular activity I was involved in during my college life was TeamKART, IIT Kharagpur. I became a part of it right in my first year and continued till my final year.\n\nHow did you get into JLR? What was the selection procedure?\n\nI got placed in JLR, during the Campus Placement Season of December 2020. The selection procedure was quite basic,\n\nA Written Test (Aptitude + Coding +Mechanical Core (only for the core profile))\n\nSOP Submission and Personal Interview\n\nThe test features regular GATE level questions for mechanical core. The test pattern in Aptitude and mechanical core were adaptive. Questions are of three difficulty levels and when you answer a question correctly you get a question of increased difficulty and when you answer a question wrong, the difficulty level drops in the next question.\n\nHow to prepare for them?\n\nMechanical Core Test: Practice gate level questions for all the domains of mechanical engineering taught across the 4 years. Keep your concepts clear rather than remembering the formulas. Companies tend to ask conceptual questions more than calculation based. Expect some calculative question though\n\nAptitude Questions: Practice different types of aptitude questions (Quantitative and Logical).\n\nCoding: Coding questions are not very advanced level, basic questions that are found online for practice will do for the preparations.\n\nInterview: KNOW YOU CV INSIDE OUT. Prepare for core questions which are related to the projects you have written in your CV. Prepare a fluent introduction of yourself and your CV in advance.\n\nAlso Prepare HR questions in advance like Strengths, weaknesses and Where do you see yourself in 5 years, etc. Finally, MOCK INTERVIEWS ARE A MUST. You will get to know the level of our confidence properly only after giving some mock interviews.\n\nHow would you describe the work culture in your company? How is the work-life balance?\n\nThe Work Culture at JLR India is all you can ask for. Being a part of JLR India doesn\u2019t mean you are confined to working with the India team, new graduates like us also work directly with the core UK team. Everyone is very approachable and open to discuss new ideas. Research is also pursued with great enthusiasm. We never feel like we are just Graduate Engineers, everyone\u2019s opinions are valued. In terms of Work-Life Balance, we are always encouraged never to work outside of working hours. The UK team is also very understandable in managing the Time-zone gap and we generally don\u2019t have to work late. So in all the balance is pretty good.\n\nHow was your experience working from home? What difficulties did you face?\n\nWorking from home is a very debatable subject. Some people feel comfortable working from home while some prefer the office work environment. Personally I don\u2019t enjoy working from home, because I had to do my internship online due to a pandemic and then the rest of the College activities happened online so I always wanted to start working in an office environment. Also collaboration is very difficult. We have to set up calls and meetings for very small discussions which can easily be done personally without wasting a lot of time in office space. Plus, it is difficult to generate interest when you have to stare at your screen for 8 hours, when you are working from home.\n\nAccording to you, who should ideally apply for this job?\n\nThe Automotive Industry is moving towards a more Software oriented philosophy with the advent of Electric vehicles and satisfying customer needs. So only people with mechanical interest can apply for this job is now a myth. Anyone who has interest in product engineering, system engineering, even AI and coding can apply for the job. A lot of interesting and cutting edge technologies are being worked on in the industry, which previously were far from the needs of the automotive industry. But not anymore."

I finished my B tech from Electrical Engineering in 2021. I am currently working at SanDisk, Western Digital as an ASIC Engineer (ASIC = Application Specific Integrated Circuit).\n\nHow did you get into Western Digital? What was the selection procedure?\n\nI got an offer from Western Digital during the Campus Placement process in my final year. The selection procedure consists of 2 stages.\n\n1st Stage was a written exam of 1hr duration, and students had to answer 45 questions of Analog Electronics in 30 minutes and 45 questions of Digital Electronics in 30 minutes.\n\n2nd Stage consisted of 4 Interview rounds. The 1st round is based on Digital Electronics for a duration of 45 mins. The 2nd round is based on Analog Electronics for a duration of 1hr 15 mins. 3rd round had both Analog and Digital based questions, and some of them needed expertise in both (Mixed Signal Electronics) which lasted for 1hr. The 4th round was an HR round for a duration of 30 minutes.\n\nHow to prepare for them?\n\nFor the first stage written exam, speed is important. The content of the exam was taught in Analog Electronics, Digital Electronics, Signals, Networks and some additional things like Verilog coding and Mixed-Signal Electronics need to be learned. Most of the questions can be answered directly with a bit of thinking.\n\nFor the Digital Electronics round, I need to be thorough with Digital Electronics concepts taught in the course. Along with that, I need to know how to implement those circuits (Logic Circuits and State Machines) in Verilog. For Verilog, I recommend Hardware Description Languages for FPGA Design on Coursera. The Analog Electronics round needs to be thorough with concepts taught by Professor Bibu Datta Sahoo sir. If they are not taught by him, there is a playlist on YouTube by Professor Behzad Razavi. Along with that, I need to solve problems from Behzad Razavi Electronics book (Design of Analog CMOS Integrated Circuits).\n\nNOTE: Analog Electronics must be learned from these 2 professors because they teach some techniques specifically used in engineering fields. For the third Mixed-Signal Electronics round, one needs to know the basics of CMOS circuitry and how Digital Logic is designed using CMOS. For Mixed Signal electronics, I recommend a course by Professor Ashis Maity which is taught in Autumn Semester. He gives a very good introduction to how the Electronics industry works and how the concepts we learned get applied in the Industry.\n\nThe HR round is light and peaceful because it is a core profile. Optional: I recommend subscribing to newsletters from companies like Texas Instruments, Analog Devices. That way you will be aware of the latest technologies, and we will get to know some good circuit ideas.\n\nHow would you describe the work culture in your company? How is the work-life balance?\n\nIt has been 5 months since I joined the organization and everything seems good so far. It feels good to be surrounded by \u201ccore people\u201d. You will get enough time and enough guidance to learn a lot of new things. Work-life balance depends on the stage of the project. If it is in its early stages, life is peaceful, which is the case for most of the time. If the project is near to tape out, then sometimes you have to work on weekends, which is like 2 or 3 weekends for a span of 6 months.\n\nHow was your experience working from home? What difficulties did you face?\n\nIt takes more time to complete a task sitting at home than working in an office, as a result, overall productivity is less in work from home. Company and Managers are trying their best to reduce the workload during this work-from-home session. If everything goes right, I will be called to the office in January or February 2022. I hope Omicron doesn\u2019t turn out to be a dangerous variant. As for difficulties, Electrical Engineering was tough, but it was worth it since my job is in a core profile. Covid hit our family from August to October in 2020, so it was a bit difficult to get out of that slump and write the exams in such a short time.\n\nAccording to you, who should ideally apply for this job?\n\nPeople who are interested in the Electronics profile should apply for this. My work includes designing new Digital Logic in Verilog, alongside implementing already existing circuits like (Comparator, MUX. PLL, etc.) in new technologies with a bit of coding\n\nAny specific advice you want to give to the junta sitting for placements this year?\n\nAll the best to you guys. You will surely find a job somewhere you like and something you want to work for. The tough part of acquiring all the important skills is over. All that is left is to find something where you can apply them. It may take some time to get that job you were longing for, but you will get it sometime, just need to have some patience. The selection preference is also high for guys with a Ph.D. or a Master\u2019s Degree compared to BTech guys in the core companies. So be aware that there are fewer opportunities per year in the core sector compared to the software/IT sector. Do not restrict yourself to CDC placements, as only a few core companies visit campus. Apply for companies off-campus through LinkedIn or some websites like Monster jobs etc.\n\nIf a job is compulsory for you, keep learning some Software basics. Learn a programming language, preferably C++, and basic Algorithms. Attend the classes regularly and learn stuff taught by professors, they are used in real life. If you get to go to the campus, do enjoy yourself with your \u201cNakama\u201d. For core guys, do participate in your hall\u2019s hardware modeling since you will learn some cool stuff that can be learned exclusively by core guys (like Raspberry Pi for example).\n\nOfficial CV is attached as image."

        "content": "FORESIGHT (2021) | Graduate Analyst at Barclays Global Services | Shishir Shahi\n\nBrief Introduction:\n\nI\u2019m Shishir Shahi. I graduated from IIT Kharagpur in 2021 from the Department of Electrical Engineering. I was enrolled in the 4-year B.Tech course. I was a boarder of Rajendra Prasad Hall of Residence. Currently, I am working in Barclays Global Services as a Graduate Analyst in a technology role.\n\nHow did you get into Barclays? What was the selection procedure?\n\nI was selected in Barclays through the campus placement drive in 2020. The selection process consists of a test and two rounds of interviews. The test consists of various questions ranging from statistical analysis, mental ability, personality-based questions, and coding. The test gauges a candidate\u2019s knowledge in different fields.\n\nThe interview consists of two rounds- the first round is usually a non-technical round with questions like \u201cWhy do you want to work in the banking industry\u201d to gauge the candidate\u2019s genuine interest in the company and work profile. There are also questions about the recent technological advancements in the financial sector.\n\nThe second round is the technical round, where the interviewer asks about the technological skills of the candidate. There is a discussion on the candidate\u2019s CV if it contains projects/interns in a technology role. A good grasp of algorithms and data structures is essential to go through this round. Knowledge about Linux, operating systems, and database management is also appreciated and helps the candidate score more points. Still, they are not essential, and the interviewer will not ask questions if you mention that you don\u2019t have experience in those fields beforehand. Strong knowledge of JAVA and Object-Oriented Programming is a huge plus for this round.\n\nHow to prepare for them?\n\nGood CV preparation is essential to crack the Barclays interviews. A large number of questions are based on the candidate\u2019s experiences and skills related to technology. You should explain every project/internship you have worked on end-to-end and the technological skill-set you gained from those experiences. A firm grasp on algorithms and data structures is also important, and you should be able to solve any problem put in front of you in the most efficient way. Apart from this you should also have some understanding about the role of technology in the banking industry and the challenges/opportunities in the field.\n\nHow would you describe the work culture in your company? How is the work-life balance?\n\nI have really liked the work culture at Barclays ever since I joined the organization in August this year. You will be working with incredibly talented people, and every person in the organization is helpful. Some exciting projects are going on which provide a great learning opportunity to every newcomer. The aspect I particularly like in the work culture in Barclays is that even in the technical role, the emphasis is not only on the \u201cHow?\u201d of things but also on the \u201cWhy?\u201d of things. The business and technology side work very closely, which creates a perfect work culture allowing people to grow more through their work. The workload is not too much, and as a policy, they try to maintain an excellent work-life balance for the employees through proper workload management. You get ample time for your personal life after work.\n\nHow was your experience working from home? What difficulties did you face?\n\nWork from home can be a little tedious as you have to work alone in a room without any of your co-workers. The companies have adapted to this work-from-home routine very efficiently as there are regular team meetings and regular interaction between people. Luckily for me, by the time I joined Barclays, the complete lockdown was over, which made it a little easier as we could go out and hang out with our friends. But even then, working from home can be a real challenge for people who like to work in teams and constantly interact with others. Working in an office is a unique experience of its own as you get to meet new people, exchange ideas, and physically interact with your colleagues. Hopefully, soon we will be able to join our offices physically.\n\nAccording to you, who should ideally apply for this job?\n\nPeople who have a passion for technology and are interested in the Fin-tech field should apply for this job. The culture at Barclays also promotes understanding the project from both the business and the technology side. So, if you are interested in technology and its business implementation, Barclays will be a good fit for you.\n\nAny specific advice you want to give to the junta sitting for placements this year?\n\nMy advice to the people sitting for placements will be to remain calm and focus on their goals. The placement season can be very disheartening and frustrating at times, and we all who have gone through it have felt it. It is vital to stay calm and keep your cool during tough times. It is usually the people who persevere and keep working hard even after setbacks during the stressful times who crack the placement season. Have faith in your preparations and be confident. Confidence is the key to cracking any interview. It is imperative to note that you must get placed in the company and profile you want to work in. When you get placed is irrelevant to your future. So, it is entirely all right if you don\u2019t get placed in a Day 1 or 2 company."

        "content": "FORESIGHT (2021) |QR Analyst at JP Morgan Chase |Raj Kumar Singh\n\n1\n\nBrief Introduction\n\nI am Raj Kumar Singh, I am working in JP Morgan Chase as a QR Analyst. I graduated from the Department of Mining Engineering, IIT Kharagpur in 2021 completing my dual degree course.\n\nHow did you get into JPMorgan Chase? What was the selection procedure?\n\nLast year JPMorgan QR was open for all departments but they shortlisted only those candidates for the test who had a CGPA of more than 7.5. They then had an online test consisting of 2 segments:\n\n1. 10 MCQ Quant questions consisting of tough puzzles and probability questions, 5 medium-level general maths questions consisting of questions from the topic of calculus, trigonometry, and linear algebra, and lastly 10 easy coding-based MCQ questions, all to be completed within 75 minutes.\n\n2. 2 coding questions, medium difficulty level, and mostly from the data structure to be completed within 45 minutes.\n\nAfter the test, they shortlisted around 25 candidates and they took interviews consisting of 3 rounds\n\n1. Quant Round: This is the most important round and a bit tough compared to other rounds and questions related to puzzles, probability and statics, machine learning, and CV-based questions were asked.\n\n2. Coding Round: A couple of medium-level coding questions related to data structures and dynamic programming were asked.\n\n3. HR Round: General questions were asked.\n\nHow to prepare for them?\n\n\u2219 For Quant I would suggest practicing quant problems as much as possible, especially from Heard on the street, 50 CPI, and brain stellar, apart from this Xinfeng and Geeks for Geeks Puzzles are good too.\n\n\u2219 Apart from questions focus on theories too of statistics and machine learning. You don\u2019t need to be a master in machine learning, but basic knowledge helps a lot.\n\n\u2219 Coding, they don\u2019t ask as though questions as the SWE role companies ask in our campus, but a good knowledge of data structures is a must. I would suggest practicing each and every problem from Interview Bit and a few famous questions from Leetcode.\n\n\u2219 They don\u2019t demand Finance knowledge but basic knowledge helps. I would suggest knowing different types of derivatives instruments, bond valuation, basic portfolio management theories, and Economics would be sufficient.\n\n\u2219 For general maths, they ask in test, I would suggest not to take so much tension of it, as they are JEE level questions which most of us are already master at it.\n\nHow would you describe the work culture in your company? How is the work-life balance?\n\nThe working environment is amazing, people here are just a text away to help you with any doubts you have, the managers are super cool. Although compared to other companies in the same domain, they make you do a lot of work, a lot, but the weekends are the days where you enjoy your life to the fullest, as they don\u2019t have on-call or other stuff as such.\n\nAlso, we have huge flexibility in working hours. you need to be in meetings whenever scheduled and complete your work on time.\n\nHow was your experience working from home? What difficulties did you face?\n\nIt wasn\u2019t bad to be honest, as we got our flexibility for it but it came at the cost of feeling alienated at times, but we do have a lot of online teams to catch up where discussing anything of work is strictly prohibited :P and also as people were so helpful and just a text away and hence absolutely no problem was there other than network issues at times from my side.\n\nAccording to you, who should ideally apply for this job?\n\nJPMC QR has a wide variety of roles, so anyone who wants to work in the Finance industry has an interest in ML and Finance, or has an interest in coding can apply for this job.\n\nAny specific advice you want to give to the junta sitting for placements this year?\n\nThe first suggestion would be relaxing your mind, the placement is a very hectic and demanding process, and at times demand luck too which isn\u2019t in your hand so don\u2019t strain yourself too much, your time will come for sure. I have friends getting placed in Day 1 and I even have friends getting placed in Day 7, but all of them are doing equally well now, so don\u2019t feel anxious, rather think positive.\n\nMy second suggestion would be not to compare yourself with anyone because the companies visiting our campus provide decent jobs to start with, so even if you got the worst placement (if in case you start thinking so) compared in your friend circle that is still one of the best jobs to start your career.\n\nMy last suggestion would be to help other people too, it is hard times with such a hectic placement schedule in which a lot of people end their days (especially in day 1\u20133) with 5\u20136 rejections daily, so it is very important to talk to people, support them and help as much as possible.\n\nOfficial CV is attached as image format."

I am presently working at Cisco.\n\nHow did you get into CISCO? What was the selection procedure?\n\nThe selection procedure has 2 phases, coding, interview.\n\nCoding: I was asked 2 coding q\u2019s, and some mcqs. Coding q\u2019s were medium in difficulty, anyone who prepared for placements can mostly do those, only problem is c++ stl is not allowed, I used python.\n\nInterview: I had 3 rounds total, 1 technical, 1 managerial, 1 hr round.\n\nIn technical one, they touched on the basics in os, networks, dbms, and asked me to implement code to 2 questions. They were of moderate difficulty, compared to previous coding rounds they were easy. The managerial round consisted of discussion around my CV, past experience, future plans, company culture fit, etc, this served as a behavioral round. The HR round consisted of just my interests and future goals and my priority for roles(application, network, embedded).\n\nHow to prepare for them?\n\nFor coding, I prepared from interviewbit, leetcode. I don\u2019t know if any better options are available this time. Especially for cisco, I would suggest practising some questions in python, as you would need it in the coding round. For os, networks, dbms, I used geeks for geeks and some course materials.\n\nFor interviews, doing mock interviews regarding projects, future goals, past experiences would help. In the managerial round, giving interviews peacefully being yourself, talking honestly and just having a nice discussion would help.\n\nHow would you describe the work culture in your company? How is the work-life balance?\n\nWork culture in cisco is pretty chill, working hours are flexible, attending meetings would be sufficient and u can set your own work timings. Work-life balance is good at cisco, the workload is not that much, also cisco came 2nd in fortune\u2019s best places to work in 2021. That says something about work-life balance here.\n\nHow was your experience working from home? What difficulties did you face?\n\nI had already spent two and half semesters from home, so I would say it\u2019s not that much new. Although I haven\u2019t been to the office yet, I am liking wfh so far. Plus is u get flexible hours, but the minus is lack of motivation due to the environment and difficulty with meetings etc. though eventually, it seems it will be hybrid.\n\nAccording to you, who should ideally apply for this job?\n\nFor me, there were 3 roles, application, network, and embedded engineer. If you wanna go for a software profile, there are more application-oriented roles, and also OS, networking oriented roles. There are few ml-related roles as well.\n\nIdeally, those who would want to work on os, networking related software would be suitable. Though there are a few pure application development related roles as well. Discussing with the manager during the interview about your future goals would be better.\n\nAny specific advice you want to give to the junta sitting for placements this year?\n\nAs It is around interview time already, being calm and performing your best gives you the best results. It is best to try to have honest and casual discussions during behavioral rounds. Just give your best, without worrying much.\n\nOfficial CV is attached as image format."

        "content": "FORESIGHT (2021) |Shakul from Dr Reddy\u2019s Laboratories\n\nBrief Introduction :\n\nHi! I am Shakul. I was privileged to have spent some of the best couple years of my life on campus as a Dual Degree student in the Chemical Engineering Department during which I gathered some interest in the research on the micro/mesoscale phenomena. I decided to work on the R&D side of Chemical Engineering and ended up joining the PhD Program in ChemE at MIT. When I\u2019m not working, I usually like enjoying food, going out for walks or watching anime.\n\nHow did you get into Dr Reddy\u2019s Laboratories? What was the selection procedure?\n\nThe placement process is not very uncommon. It was conducted in a virtual way for us. Dr. Reddy\u2019s has a shortlisting test, which tests your core concepts along with some chemistry (afaik it was mostly polymers) along with a logical reasoning part (pattern identification mostly).\n\nThen, there is a GD round which is usually more technical and requires you to discuss as a team and come up with a solution within a reasonable time limit. While on one hand it is good to come forward and speak, you need to ensure that you do not cut others off. Also, few ingenious points go a long way compared to a barrage of obvious things.\n\nAfter the GD, there was only one interview round which involved questions from your resume, previous internships and HR-related things.\n\nHow to prepare for them?\n\nFirst of all, it is best to have an idea of whether you are interested in core CH or not. If you are, then try to pay attention to the key ideas delivered in the class. Also, try to maintain a good CGPA. I guess anything over an 8 should be a good sign. Finally, make sure you get hold of some good notes (books would be too daunting) on the major Chemical Engineering areas \u2014 Reaction Engineering, Mass Transfer and Fluid Mechanics in particular. Study from the notes to revise the fundamentals. Try to keep an open mind during the interview.\n\nHow would you describe the work culture in your company? How is the work-life balance?\n\nBased on what I\u2019ve heard, Dr. Reddy\u2019s offers decent work-life balance. The cultural aspects could change over time and I feel it is best to ask the folks currently working in the company.\n\nHow was your experience working from home? What difficulties did you face?\n\nWorking from home seems like a great idea at first but I was constantly missing out on all the fun. Work-from-home settings tend to leave you in circumstances where you are too bored or lazy to work because of the inverse effect of working too much. I tried to balance my productivity by taking short breaks (naps), organizing brainstorming sessions and staying connected with friends.\n\nAccording to you, who should ideally apply for this job?\n\nThe ideal candidate would be one who is interested in pharmaceutical manufacturing. The company appears to value those who have had some experience (in relevant\n\nacademic/industrial pursuits) and those who display knowledge and interest in production challenges (Process Engineering).\n\nAny specific advice you want to give to the junta sitting for placements this year.\n\nOne of the biggest hurdles between you and that offer is your own doubt.\n\nOfficial CV is attached in a image format."

        "content": "FORESIGHT (2021) |Post Graduate Engineer Trainee researcher at Mercedes Benz| Anuraag Bhattacharya\n\nBrief Introduction:\n\nI graduated from IIT KGP in 2021 with a Dual Degree in Electrical Engineering (specialization in Instrumentation and Signal Processing). I got placed in Mercedes Benz Research and Development India during the placement season of 2020\u201321 and joined the company as a Post Graduate Engineer Trainee (AI/ML) in MBRDI\u2019s Intelligent Interior (Algorithm) team from August 2021.\n\nHow did you get into Mercedes Benz? What was the selection procedure?\n\nThe company conducted an online coding test, on the basis of which they prepared the shortlist for the interview round. The interview was almost an hour-long, with 5 different people interviewing me one by one. The questions were mainly focused on machine learning and deep learning concepts, and also a fair bit on the internships that I had done. I was also asked questions from computer vision as I had a fair bit of background in the same, and I was not prepared for the same as computer vision concepts were not something that I had revised specifically for CDC interviews. Fortunately, I was able to tackle most of the questions on that topic. I got selected based on my performance in the interview.\n\nHow to prepare for them?\n\nLike many of my peers who were preparing for software/ML roles, I spent most of my time preparing for coding tests in popular programming platforms such as Interview Bit, LeetCode etc. I also prepared for machine learning/deep learning questions from various sources (course material and various online sources). However, as ML/DL roles are limited in number as far as CDC placements are concerned compared to SWE roles, I devoted most of my preparation time to Data Structures and Algorithms. Prior to interviews, I focused mostly on topics that I was most proficient in. It is also important to be prepared for questions focused on projects/internships mentioned in the CV.\n\nHow would you describe the work culture in your company? How is the work-life balance?\n\nI was very impressed by the work culture in MBRDI. Since the team that I work in is focused mostly on the R&D side of things, we generally don\u2019t have daily deadline pressure. The work-life balance is ideal. We get enough time for our own selves during weekdays and have the whole weekend off. We also get considerable liberty to explore and carry out research in topics and problems that interest us. Apart from that, we receive a lot of support, guidance and help from our fellow teammates and seniors, which makes work a lot more enjoyable. I consider myself very lucky to be a part of this wonderful company.\n\nHow was your experience working from home? What difficulties did you face?\n\nAccording to you, who should ideally apply for this job?\n\nIdeally, people who are fairly proficient in Data Structures and Algorithms and are interested to work in the field of ML/DL and have some kind of background in the same (in the form of courses, projects, internships, etc.) should apply for this job. Last year, the position was offered only to students having/pursuing a masters.\n\nAny specific advice you want to give to the junta sitting for placements this year?\n\nDo your preparation wisely. If you are someone who is targeting SWE roles as well as ML/DL roles, make sure to spend most of your time preparing Data Structures and Algorithms, as that will come in handy in most of your interviews. I would not encourage anyone to focus solely on ML/DL roles, as only a handful of companies offer the same. Stay confident, stay focused and don\u2019t lose hope if you face a few rejections at the beginning, rest assured your time will come eventually, and it is important that you keep your composure till the end. A lot also depends on luck, so don\u2019t be hard on yourself if you see your peers getting placed before you do. After all, days 1,2,3 are just numbers \ud83d\ude0a All the best to everyone sitting for placements this year! Do not worry, something wonderful is waiting for you on the other side.\n\nOfficial CV is attached in a image format."

        "content": "FORESIGHT (2021) |Pre-Doctoral researcher at Google | Sohan Rudra\n\nBrief Introduction:\n\nHi, my name is Sohan Rudra and I am a Pre-Doctoral researcher at Google Research India where I work at the intersection of Reinforcement Learning and Robotics. I graduated this year from the Department of Mathematics (Maths and Computing) at IIT Kharagpur.\n\nHow did you get into Google? What was the selection procedure?\n\nI came across this position through a KGP senior who works at Google. Usually, during late September or October, the job position is published on the career page. I applied as soon as possible using an employee referral. The official interviews started in January (subject to change) and consisted of three rounds, namely coding, research and team-fit (all 45 minutes). The coding round consisted of standard Data-Structures and Algorithms style questions. The research interview round consisted of questions from the projects on my CV; and my chosen area of interest (Reinforcement Learning). After these rounds, a hiring committee decides whether the candidate meets the bar based on interview feedback. A team-fit-round commences after this. This round involves having discussions with potential managers. If both the parties (you and the team) agree on the fit, the company floats an offer.\n\nHow to prepare for them?\n\nFor research interviews (in Machine Learning), you need two things\n\n1) Total familiarization with the projects in your CV,\n\n2) Good clarity of the fundamentals of mathematics and machine learning. To re-familiarize myself with the projects in my CV, I scavenged through my documentation/papers and revisited all the nitty-gritty details in each one. As I was already in mathematics and computing, I have a background in relevant mathematical concepts of Machine Learning. I revised notes from my courses in probability, linear algebra, optimization etc. Apart from these, I referred to the following books for preparation, Cracking the Coding Interview by Gayle Laakmann McDowell, Deep Learning by Aaron Courville, Ian Goodfellow, & Yoshua Bengio and Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction by Andrew Barto and Richard S. Sutton. Also, it\u2019s helpful to remain up to date with the seminal works in one\u2019s research area.\n\nHow would you describe the work culture in your company? How is the work-life balance?\n\nThe work culture at Google revolves around people, collaboration and impact. One is always encouraged to solve problems that can have a huge impact on people. You will get to meet and work with many eminent researchers from all over the world. Everyone is very helpful, and no one is unreachable. The learning curve is quite steep but very rewarding. Also, the company makes various accommodations towards the mental health and well being of all its employees. The work-life balance is good; one can get ample amount of time for themselves after work. Managing time zones can be a bit challenging at times, as most of the projects are worked upon by several different teams from all over the world which requires effective collaboration from all sides.\n\nHow was your experience working from home? What difficulties did you face?\n\nWorking from home is challenging, not going to lie. Although teams try their best to facilitate open communication channels by having one-on-one and chill-out sessions, still it can never replace face to face conversations. Now that I have spent a week working from the office, I can firmly say; that the amount of enriching conversations that one can have by casually bumping into people or having lunch or coffee is not possible virtually. It also makes everything a bit more collaborative as you sometimes chit chat with your teammates and managers, brainstorm together and help each other solve problems. In WFH, one needs to be more alert about their well being, making sure that you don\u2019t get burnt out and always keep people informed by talking as much as you can with your team and managers. I struggled a lot with imposter syndrome, but\n\nAfter actively communicating with my manager, things changed for the better. In WFH conditions, communication and setting up proper schedules for yourself has become even more crucial.\n\nAccording to you, who should ideally apply for this job?\n\nThe pre-Doctoral researcher is a limited contract position with an aim towards helping people get relevant research exposure and preparing them for applying to a PhD program. So I would say this position is ideal for someone who has a keen interest in Machine Learning research and would like to explore the field more. Even people who are in stitches between academia and industry can apply and get more clarity.\n\nAny specific advice you want to give to the junta sitting for placements this year.\n\nEven though this blog is not about on-campus placements, but having gone through the process myself, I can understand the tremendous pressure that people are under during these times. The best advice from my side is to reach out as much as you can to your peers, parents, seniors, etc. Let people know when you need any help; for example, a couple of my friends (pass-outs at that time) recommended various books, looked at my CV countless times, helped me with interview processes etc. Also, I have seen people treat interviews like exams and try to cram their way into it, which is the completely wrong approach. They are like a conversation, and so there are no expectations that you have to know everything. Placements are a culmination of the four or five years of your college life, not the last four or five days. Hence, it is perfectly ok to say I have not worked on XYZ, so I don\u2019t know. And lastly, I know that it is difficult, but keep your mental health a top priority and take care of yourself. Going into the interview with a healthy mindset can make all the difference.\n\nOff campus and On campus CV are attached in image format."
