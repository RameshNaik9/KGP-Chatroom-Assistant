        "content": "FORESIGHT(2022): Placement at Eaton | Compilation\n\nBrief Introduction\n\nI am Saksham Kumar, an M.Tech final year student of mechanical systems design (department of mechanical engineering) at IIT Kharagpur. I have done my B.Tech in mechanical engineering from IIT Patna. I have received a job offer from Eaton Technologies Private Limited through campus placements at IIT Kharagpur.\n\nI am Rahul Agrawal currently pursuing my Master\u2019s in Mechanical System Design in the Department of Mechanical Engineering at IITKGP. I did my BTech from Pune University and graduated in 2019 from there and then joined IITKGP for a master\u2019s program in 2020 and I have received an offer from Eaton Technologies Private Limited.\n\nI\u2019m Shuvoshree Bhattacharya from the Department of Electrical Engineering. I have done my MS (by research) under Dr. Ashis Maity and Prof. Amit Patra. My broad area of research was Power management in IC. I got an offer from EATON (role- Eaton technical leadership programme) during the last placement season (2021\u201322).\n\nMy name is Saurabh Prakash and I\u2019m pursuing my post-graduation in Electrical Engineering with machine Drives and Power Electronics as my specialization(2020\u201322) at IIT Kharagpur. I am placed in EATON and my profile is ETLP(Eaton technical leadership programme).\n\nHow did you get into Eaton? What was the selection procedure?\n\nEATON is a core mechanical company and they shortlisted students based on their CVs.\n\nThe shortlisted students were then called in for technical interviews. The technical interview went on for almost 45 minutes where initially I was asked basic questions from Vibrations. After the initial 5\u201310 minutes, for the next 10 minutes the interviewer asked questions completely on my MTP (he seemed interested in that). After that my algorithmic thinking was checked by giving me a problem statement and asking me to write a pseudo code for it. The later part of my interview was based on some basic questions from other subjects like Mechanics of Material, Finite Element Methods, Engineering Mechanics, etc.\n\nSome of the students were then shortlisted for the HR interview from the technical interview. In the HR interview, the questions asked were Introduce Yourself? Why EATON? Have you ever had to make a compromise with your principles? How did you manage to do it? What was the biggest challenge that you faced in your projects? What did you learn from it? The interviewer asked HR questions for about 20 minutes.\n\nHow to prepare for them?\n\nThe best key to preparing for any core company is to make sure our basics are clear. The shortlisting for the interviews was done based on submitted CVs. Therefore, it is advised that the students targeting these jobs should have a strong CV. They should devote ample amounts of time to writing as well as polishing their CVs.The students should be fully aware of whatever they have written in their CVs and they should be ready to answer any question related to them. Getting their CVs evaluated by some seniors who are experts in the field is also a good idea. Many core companies take written tests as their first round to shortlist for interviews. So, students targeting such roles should revise important technical subjects taught in B.Tech as well as the various topics of aptitude. Apart from this, they should practice important HR questions. Some practice for speaking good English is also preferable.\n\nWhat difficulties did you face while preparing for this Company/Profile? How did you overcome this problem?\n\nIt was mostly related to projects and resumes. You should do your project with utmost sincerity that will suffice the purpose. The only thing is that you should relate everything that you say in the interview to real and practical scenarios. I think any core company will look for candidates having sound fundamentals and having good command in 2\u20133 subjects. To overcome this problem, I utilized a few books which are related to GATE preparation. Many such books contain the theory of subjects in a brief manner through which we can revise important stuff. Such books are also very helpful for practicing numerical questions. The questions asked in the written tests of core companies are generally on the easier side of the GATE-level questions.\n\nAccording to you, who should ideally apply for this job?\n\nThe one who is inclined towards the core job in Electrical and Mechanical Engineering Students who are very much interested in core jobs and looking for a long-term career in mechanical engineering should apply for this job. EATON is a very good company to start your career with due to its working culture and the projects it takes. Those who like the area of machine learning and data analysis would also like the role. Data analysis is nowadays used a lot in many core companies too.\n\nI wish all the very best to everyone sitting for this year\u2019s placement.\n\nAny specific advice you want to give to the junta sitting for placements this year?\n\nPlacement season is exhausting, both mentally and physically. Just keep faith in yourself, start working from the beginning and keep your basics clear. The most important thing, be confident. And try to explain anything like you are explaining to a layman (of course by using some engineering terminology), in simple terms, that reflect your understanding of the concept. The placement phase is a time when it is important to maintain your cool and not get very affected if you are not getting the desired outcomes. During this time, your focus should be to appear in as many interviews as you can irrespective of past results. Please do not let the result of one interview/written exam affect the result of another. You should not take any rejection personally and focus on playing the game. I wish all the very best to everyone sitting for this year\u2019s placement. Something good is waiting for all of you."

        "content": "FORESIGHT(2022): Placement at American Express | Adithya K S\n\nQ. Brief Introduction\n\nA. My name is Adithya K S, I am a student of the Humanities and Social Sciences Department enrolled in the 5 year Integrated MSc Economics course. I got placed at American Express in Gurgaon in the Management Trainee role, through CDC. I\u2019m looking forward to shifting to Gurgaon from Bangalore sometime soon!\n\nQ. How did you get into AMEX ? What was the selection procedure?\n\nA. Amex was one of the earliest companies to conduct their placement test, which was in late October. There was only one test, followed by 2 rounds of interviews on Day 1.\n\nQ. How to prepare for them?\n\nA. The test for the management trainee profile is heavy in mathematics. It is essential to have a strong grasp in probability and statistics. In general, a good understanding of first and second-year mathematics is important. As these concepts are very useful in other tests as well, the preparation for this test does not require any additional effort as such.\n\nIn my experience, the interview rounds have no specific structure. It is driven by the interviewer and the candidate. What is essentially being tested is the problem-solving ability of the candidate. The latter rounds do have the tendency to revolve around the credit and credit card business, hence it would be beneficial to read up on how companies like Amex and their competitors generate revenues and how they do so differently from each other. Overall, it is also important to make yourself extremely familiar with your resume, as questions regarding your CV can also be expected.\n\nQ. What difficulties did you face while preparing for this Company/Profile? How did you overcome this problem?\n\nA. The tests for companies that come later in the placement process seem easier simply because of the practice you get from continuously taking tests. As the test for Amex is usually quite early in the process, I found it difficult to be sufficiently prepared for it. However, it is in this case where you must approach your seniors or batchmates who have already been placed at Amex, so as to gain a better understanding of what would be required of you for the test, and subsequently the interview as well. As the interview process doesn\u2019t have a repeated structure that is followed year in and year out, the only way to be sufficiently prepared is through continuous practice. There is no getting around the required time investment. The plus side is that this practice would also be extremely beneficial for interviews for other companies as well.\n\nQ. According to you, who should ideally apply for this job?\n\nA. Any candidate interested in analytics must apply. Additionally, those interested in finance and consulting can also apply.\n\nQ. Any specific advice you want to give to the junta sitting for placements this year?\n\nA. Start preparations early, preferably by July-August. That also includes identifying which profiles you are interested in and concentrating on those. Starting early also affords you the time to work on your interview and soft skills, which are very important. Having the ability to appear confident and be personable can help you get through many interviews, and these skills can be acquired through practice. Start at 2 mock interviews a week. To that end, you can approach your batchies or seniors. It is most efficient and beneficial to learn from your peers. Being able to share acquired knowledge in this way will undoubtedly help all those involved.\n\nQ. What are some of the major points you think would be valid to mention while targeting this profile?\n\nA. It is important to consistently build on your skills, either by taking courses or doing projects. Either one (or ideally, both) on your CV will show recruiters that you are eager to learn. However, as I mentioned before, having good interview skills is at times more essential."

I was also awarded as Campus winner for ITC\u2019s Interrobang Season-11 as part of its unconventional placement process for the SCM role.\n\nHow did you get into Honeywell? What was the selection procedure?\n\nI am placed at Honeywell during the 2021\u201322 campus placement drive during Dec\u201921. But the process was started 1\u20132 months before it. There were 3 rounds altogether.\n\nTechnical interview:\n\nHR Interview:\n\nHow to prepare for them?\n\nHonestly speaking, I started very late, So I haven\u2019t left with much time to do CP, but I would recommend one to do rigorous CP as it helps you to get through coding rounds easily, where I felt difficulty getting through, even after doing all questions due to competition in time taken.\n\nSince I haven\u2019t done a lot of CP, I was just building upon conceptual learning by doing various in-depth advanced algorithmic self-projects.\n\nIt just not helped me to learn and understand in-depth and intricate concepts in less time but also gave me good points to quote on my resume and even helped me to drive the interviews in my comfort zone.\n\nRemember that the best way to learn a concept is to apply it yourself to a real-life project.\n\nAccording to you who should ideally apply for this job\n\nThis company has business in different segments and fields and is a company that sells a product, not just only software. One who loves to see their ideas being implemented in real life, creates products to be used in large industries such as large shopping complexes, planes, etc.\n\nAny specific advice you want to give to the junta sitting for placements this year.\n\nAnything more you want to share?\n\nI want to share that I could not bag an internship in my CDC pre-final year. I had seen many of my friends who had got an internship but weren\u2019t very happy as it wasn\u2019t in one of the best companies. The same case might be with many more. Everyone should continue trying and never give up!\n\nAnother important point to be noted is to be clear with your thoughts. I was preparing for more than one profile, management, and software. Sometimes, in the HR round of the technical profile, I was talking about leadership skills. The interviewer did not like it as it suggested that I aimed to be a team leader rather than a team member(even though the team leader is in the first place a team member before being a leader). I would advise the juniors to keep a fine boundary between different profiles."

I received offers from Graviton Research Capital LLP and Google India. My Day1 shortlists included companies such as Uber, Rubrik, Quadeye, Quantbox, Apple, etc. My prior internship experience provides research internships with Adobe and IBM. To briefly tell you about my profile. I worked as a software developer intern at Amazon Germany. I was a member of the AUV Research Group at IIT Kharagpur. Apart from my work experience, I am good at problem-solving (competitive programming) and have some publications.\n\nHow did you get into Graviton Software? What was the selection procedure?\n\nGraviton visited the campus for the Software and Quant Role. Graviton conducted tests for shortlisting candidates for their interviews. I appeared for the Software test, where there were two coding questions and around 4\u20135 theoretical questions. The coding questions were medium-hard, and I solved them fully. In theory, there were questions on concepts revolving around OS, DBMS, Networks, and Computer architecture. Students were expected to write steps for theory-based questions. I solved some of these questions. Since I completed all coding queries and a good amount of theoretical questions, I was shortlisted for the Graviton placement interview.\n\nThe interviewer mainly asked questions about C++ and operating systems. I was told in the interview that they were happy with my performance in the coding test. In short, Graviton looks into candidates\u2019 profiles holistically. There are no single criteria, but a decent GPA, a grasp of concepts in C++, and previous internship experience will be beneficial.\n\nHow to prepare for them?\n\nGraviton Research is a high-frequency trading firm that requires low-level coding. One can expect questions from C++, operating systems, computer networks, and computer architecture. \u2018Learn CPP\u2019 is a good source for knowing the functionalities of the C++ language.

How is the work-life balance?\n\nI am yet to begin my job at Graviton, so I may not be able to provide the most accurate insights. Regarding my interaction with employees, the company has a flat hierarchy and a startup-like fast-paced environment. The team is small and has talented engineers from different IITs. There is a lot of handwork and learning that comes with all this.\n\nAccording to you, who should ideally apply for this job?\n\nAnyone interested in trading or computer systems must apply for the job. The HFTs don\u2019t expect students to know about low-latency programming or trading beforehand but look for the student's interest.\n\nAny specific advice you want to give to the junta sitting for placements this year?\n\nStart preparing early and manage your time well. Figure out the profile of companies you are interested in and work smartly. Proofread the resume (if possible, seek the help of seniors) and practice mock interviews as much as possible. Stay calm and assertive during all the tests and interviews."

        "content": "FORESIGHT(2022): Placement at Da Vinci Derivatives | Kousshik Raj\n\nBrief Introduction\n\nHello folks! I will discuss my CDC placement experience leading to an offer from Da Vinci Derivatives. First, a bit about myself and my background. I am Kousshik Raj, a dual degree student from the Computer Science and Engineering Department. I interned at Quadeye Securities, an HFT, as a Systems Engineer. I entered the CDC placement process and received an offer from Da Vinci Derivatives, an HFT, for the Software Engineer position in The Netherlands.\n\nHow did you get into Da Vinci Derivatives? What was the selection procedure?\n\nDuring the placement process, I opted for the positions I was interested in, mostly related to Systems and Software. Among these, I was very much interested in the HFT ones, in which Da Vinci Derivatives was one among my top considerations. Moving on to the particulars of their selection process, there was an online test for 30\u201340 mins. Unconventionally, the focus of the test was primarily C++ functionalities and semantics, with 50 MCQs on them, which was quite in my favor, considering that was one of my fortes. After this, I was shortlisted for the interview process, and I believe there were not more than five people who got through for this role.\n\nThe interview process was very straightforward. There was only a single round of interviews, which went on for around an hour, which can be treated as a mix of technical and HR. We started with my introduction, then moved on to my work during my internship, considering the roles were nearly the same. There were many questions regarding my work, how I approached it, the difficulties I faced, and my overall experience. Moving on, there were general algorithm and data structures questions, the complexities of various containers in STL, and then there were questions on the concepts of process and threading. The implications of various standard practices and the tradeoffs considered were also tested. Overall, they tested how I perform over a wide array of topics, and although none of them were complex, all of them, in one way or another, required quite some out of box thought. Then I was asked about my general interest in the role and the company. Other significant projects I have worked on were also examined. Finally, after an hour of satisfying interview experience, I got to know about my acceptance at the end of the interview.\n\nNow let\u2019s talk about all the behind-the-scenes stuff, aka preparations. In general, all HFTs that post a System/Software engineer will somehow or the other test your C++ skills, as it is one of the go-to choices for developing their platforms. Well, at least in most cases, this is true. And anyway, having a solid foundation in C++ is always a big plus. And one of my most exciting and promising sources of preparation is here. Feel free to use this or any other sound source online. Besides this, being well-versed in algorithms and data structures is a must, which is essential for almost every role out there. And for this, I\u2019d say Competitive Programming helped me the most. I have been taking up CP on and off since my 1st year, solving numerous problems and participating in various contests across platforms like Codeforces, CodeChef, etc. This has helped me hone my algorithm and data structure knowledge and improve my problem-solving skills. And finally, I have also brushed up my knowledge of Operating Systems and Computer Networks, as this is a part of the core technical knowledge involved in the work you will carry out if you are selected and will be most surely tested.\n\nAccording to you, who should ideally apply for this job?\n\nIn general, I think people who are very interested in programming and Systems, in particular, will enjoy the work that is expected of you in these sorts of roles. Although things might be a handful, they will also be exciting, keeping you occupied.\n\nAny specific advice you want to give to the junta sitting for placements this year?\n\nOne of the most critical aspects usually neglected is your CGPA. Usually, such positions also expect excellent academic results. So have to work on that, if you are interested. Involving yourself in other non-academic development and technical projects will also give you quite an advantage over your peers who didn\u2019t. Keep yourself motivated and brush up on the nec-usually-essary knowledge, and you are all set to go. All the best, junta!"

        "content": "FORESIGHT(2022): Placement at Wells Fargo| Bharat Chaudhary\n\nBrief Introduction\n\nMy Name is Bharat Chaudhary. I am a fifth-year undergraduate student at the Department of Mathematics enrolled in its five-year integrated MSc Course of Mathematics and Computing. I am a Border of Pt. Madan Mohan Malviya Hall of Residence. I am from Hanumangarh (Rajasthan).\n\nHow did you get into Wells Fargo? What was the selection procedure?\n\nSo Wells Fargo came in CDC placement Tests in the early phase. The test was around 23 October. There were two roles to apply one was analytics and one was Technical Associate which is similar to software engineer.\n\nThe online Test was on the Amcat Platform.\n\nThere were three sections in the online test. For both profiles The test was the same.\n\nThe first section was English and second section was Aptitude and the final section has 2 coding questions. One coding question was medium and one was difficult. It is very important to attempt both questions even if you can\u2019t get all test cases passed you can go for partial test cases as well.\n\nSo on the basis of this two different shortlist was made from the same test.\n\nThere were two rounds of Interviews. The first was technical and managerial. It went for more than one hour. They first asked me to introduce myself then they asked me to go through my projects one by one. They asked questions about my projects like why I use this algorithm what was the complexity, can you explain the algorithm. After this, they asked about my 2 month internship project. They asked me questions of the spring boot framework because I have used that in my internship. They also asked me about layers of the spring framework, what task I did in my internship, which database I used and why.\n\nAfter that they gave me two medium coding questions, one was based on the array and one was based on sorting. They also asked me to write pseudo code on google docs with screen sharing so it is important to prepare for code writing as well. Then they asked me questions about oops and operating systems. These were basic questions. Then some managerial questions were given on some situations and how I would handle things, so for this just gave the answer which you think is correct and not to impress the panelists.\n\nAfter 1st round, there was The last round of the HR round. The HR round went for 10 minutes. She asked me about my background, my strengths, my motivation in my family.\n\nAfter that I got my confirmation that I was selected by the company.\n\nHow to prepare for them?\n\nFirst of all you should know whatever you are writing in your CV. You should revise all your projects thoroughly because they will ask in-depth questions about your projects in the internships.\n\nSecond thing which I think is important to do in a sde role is at least having one backend project based on the spring framework. Most Companies use spring boot as primary framework and you should also know about javascript, databases. Highlight these things in your CV so that panelists ask questions on this and be prepared for this.\n\nNow coming to most important part coding, try solving all medium level problems on leetcode. Go through all gfg interview experience of that particular company. Leetcode is more than enough for your coding round and interviews. Complete all your concepts in DSA from geeksforgeeks it is the best resource available. While practice give your concentration on time complexity and space complexity. Try solving 3\u20134 good coding problems on daily basis.\n\nFor oops,os,networks you can refer to some good youtube channels for basic understanding, you can read them from articles on gfg or you can take the basic course of gfg for all these subjects where you can prepare well for interview.\n\nHow would you describe the work culture in your company? How is the work-life balance?\n\nI can\u2019t describe much but whatever info I got from my seniors work-life balance is best in wells fargo.\n\nAccording to you, who should ideally apply for this job?\n\nI would say apply in every profile because we all are not industry experts, they will ask basic questions on profiles. But ideally for applying in Wells Fargo one who has strong hold on coding and projects, has a CG above 8. CG is very important. In roles like SDE or Analytics, your PORs will not matter at all. If you have less CGPA then you should have the best coding among your batchmates that thing only can ensure good placements in SDE roles. But in the last CGPA matters, a lot and good projects in CV will increase your chances.\n\nAny specific advice you want to give to the junta sitting for placements this year?\n\nplan well and start early. Two things that are most important in your life is time and management so start preparing coding practice early even when you are doing your internships because even if you get a PPO, coding will help you in off-campus placements as well."

        "content": "Foresight(2022): Placement at Dream11 | Pujan Burad\n\n1) Brief Introduction\n\nHi! My name is Pujan Burad. I am a final year undergraduate student from the department of Metallurgical and Materials Engineering. I am from Malkapur, Maharashtra. I was offered a full-time role as a Software Development Engineer at Dream11 during the campus placement process conducted by CDC.\n\n2) How did you get into Dream 11? What was the selection procedure?\n\nThe selection procedure consisted of 2 stages.\n\nThe first was an online coding assessment(3 questions) of 1 hour and 30 minutes. The questions were of medium-hard difficulty level and were primarily on array and DP. The second was the interview stage which involved 2 technical rounds and 1 HR round. The first technical round focused primarily on data structures and algorithms, and 2\u20133 questions were asked. I had to code the solution on CodePair and explain my approach to the interviewer while optimizing the solution both on time and space.\n\nThe second round was more focused on resume and questions were asked on the work I did during my internship, probability and use case of different data structures. The last round was a culture round with an AVP of the company and HR to check the fit with the company. Basic HR questions and situational-based questions were asked in this round.\n\n3) How to prepare for them?\n\nThe preparation for applying for software roles through CDC is pretty straightforward. The main focus should be on preparing yourself well for the coding rounds. There are courses available online focusing on DSA preparation. Some of them are pretty well structured, so you save a lot of time by not having to search for topics from different places. InterviewBit is a good starting point for the preparation along with Codeforces Ladder.\n\nA few of the things that I found useful during my preparation were:\n\n- Solving Ladders on Codeforces\n\n- Practicing problems on InterviewBit/Leetcode\n\n- Making notes\n\n- Bookmarking questions where you struggled/learned a new concept so you can revisit them later.\n\nFew companies also ask MCQs on OOPS and basic questions from subjects like DBMS, Networks and OS. You can prepare them accordingly from GFG and HackerRank for SQL. Algozenith has a post on how to prepare the CS Fundamentals in great detail: Link to post\n\nIt\u2019s also important to write clean code and not just efficient code. Use of proper variable names and indentation will help in debugging your code faster, with better readability and is a very important aspect in coding interviews.\n\n4) What difficulties did you face while preparing for this Company/Profile? How did you overcome this problem\n\nThe most difficult part is clearing the coding round. A lot of students apply for software roles, so you need to be very good at writing efficient codes quickly. Time becomes an important factor in shortlisting where lots of students have solved all the questions.\n\nA problem I faced not specific to this profile, but in general, was that I started preparing too late. A time period of 3\u20134 months is enough to cover DSA and the basics of CS fundamentals. Coding rounds generally start by September end. Therefore I would suggest starting by June to give you enough time to practice a wide range of questions and cover all the topics.\n\n5) According to you, who should ideally apply for this job?\n\nAnyone who\u2019s good at coding and problem solving, and has a keen interest in software development should apply.\n\n6) Any specific advice you want to give to the junta sitting for placements this year?\n\nPlacements can be very hectic and frustrating. It\u2019s important that you stay in touch with your friends and family. Start early and prepare well. Get your CV reviewed by your friends and seniors. Mock interviews are the best way to ward off nervousness during actual interviews. Stay calm and confident and don\u2019t be disheartened seeing friends get placed early in the season. Rejections are part of the process and learn from them. Your hard work and efforts will pay off in the end. All the best!!"

My name\u2019s Deepanshi Pandey and I am currently pursuing M.Tech(CSE) from IIT Kharagpur. I took part in the placement season of 2021.\n\nHow did you get into Qualcomm software? What was the selection procedure?\n\nThe process had one test followed by three interview rounds. The test had a coding and an aptitude section. The coding questions belonged to the medium to hard category while the aptitude questions were from an easy to medium category.\n\nThe first interview round was a technical round where I was asked about my projects deeply. Then there were questions mostly on operating systems and data structures followed by a medium-level code. The code was to be written on hackerrank and had to pass all the test cases. The second round was conducted within 10 mins of round 1. This also was a technical round which consisted of questions related to system design. They do not expect much during this round from the student and help a lot so that you follow the path correctly towards forming a solution. The third round was the HR round where I was asked situation questions. They also gave me some insights about the company and various teams with which I would have to work.\n\nHow to prepare for them?\n\nFor placements, leetcode is considered one of the best mediums to prepare for coding as it contains concept-based questions and a huge discussion section. The preparation should be started by the end of April. Initially one should start with at least 2\u20133 mediums questions a day. The easy questions help a lot in motivating you initially to continue your preparation consistently so they should also be done along with the medium questions. Gradually you should shift to about 7\u20138 medium questions and a hard question.\n\nCompleting 400+ questions in leetcode would make you confident enough to crack the coding rounds of interviews and tests.\n\nThe preparation should also consist of mock coding tests which are conducted in various coding websites. This should be done at least once per week sincerely.\n\nAlso, a bit of background information about the company can act as a plus point during the interviews.\n\nHow was your experience working from home? What difficulties did you face?\n\nI live in a small village in Uttarakhand where there is no stable internet connection and a lot of electricity issues. I was facing a lot of difficulties during my coursework. So I had to shift to another place where I could give my placement tests and interviews peacefully.\n\nAccording to you, who should ideally apply for this job?\n\nThe students aspiring to work as software developers in the near future should apply for the role. As Qualcomm now wants to extend its software base so there would be a lot to learn with the growth of career in joining the company for an SDE role.\n\nAny specific advice you want to give to the junta sitting for placements this year?\n\nConsistency is the key. Preparation should be done everyday. You should at least complete one question each day even if you want to take a break for that particular day. Also, confidence and good communication skills during interviews are very crucial. Giving mock interviews from various websites or among friends could be good practice."

        "content": "Foresight(2022): Placement at Google | Vinay Kumar Agarwal\n\nBrief Introduction\n\nHello everyone, This is Vinay Kumar Agarwal, a final year UG student from Mathematics department enrolled in Integrated M.Sc. course. I did my compulsory internship at Mastercard Technology Private Ltd. during the summer of 2021 . I recently got a SDE campus graduate role offer from Google during the placement season last year.\n\nHow did you get into Google? What was the selection procedure?\n\nI got placed at Google India during the placement season last year. The selection procedure consisted of an online coding contest and 3 rounds of interviews of 45 minutes each. The online contest had two coding questions with one being of easy level and other in medium- hard category which were expected to be solved in 60 minutes. Based on the contest , few students were shortlisted for the interviews. There were 3 interviews in which 2 were purely DSA based and 1 was a mixed DSA and Googlyness round. Google has a special \" Googleyness \" round in which they generally assess candidate's qualities like being a team player, friendly, ethical, respectful , valuing yourself and others . It was about imagining yourself as a Googler and then how you would react to different situations given by the interviewer.\n\nHow to prepare for them?\n\nTo prepare for Software Development Role in Google, one needs to have good knowledge of data structures and algorithms and strong problem solving skills. There is no restriction on programming language. One can choose any language to solve the questions. Google interviews does not focus on advanced data structures and algorithms like Segment trees or Red Black trees or Convex Hull problem although having knowledge of them can give a candidate an edge over others. Interviews question are mostly based on arrays, strings, recursion, geometry, greedy algorithms, dynamic programming, two pointers, binary search, graph algorithms, trie and trees .So it is really important to understand these basic stuff thoroughly before diving into complex data structures and algorithms.\n\nOne should regularly give contests on competitive coding platforms like codeforces, codechef and atcoder. This will help them in improving their speed and problem solving ability. For Interview questions, one must solve InterviewBit questions and then practice standard questions at Leetcode. One positive aspect of Google is that Interviews do not focus on core computer fundamentals like Computer Networks, Operating Systems, Database Management and Computer Architecture so one should expect questions mostly from DSA.\n\nAlso, one needs to have a good understanding of the time complexity of different algorithms .Apart from these technical details, speed is also important since one needs to explain the solution approach to the interviewer and code it in the limited time given. The interviewee is expected to write a error free code with proper function names and comments. I even earned extra points due to my speed and clean code in one of my interviews. Giving few mock interviews before actual interview would be of great help.\n\nAccording to you, who should ideally apply for this job?\n\nAn ideal person to apply for this role would be one who has passion for technology and wants his/her work to affect millions of lives because of the huge Google user-base. He/She will get to work with some of the best minds in the industry.\n\nThe work culture at Google is one of the most healthy and fun work environment in the industry. The company invests a lot in the growth of its employees and cares immensely about the employees. One of the unique rule in Google is \u201c80\u201320\u201d rule. This means that employees are encouraged to spend 80% of their time on the core projects and the rest 20% on innovation activities that peak their own personal interests. This greatly helps employees to keep learning and growing.\n\nAny specific advice you want to give to the junta sitting for placements this year?\n\nAn advice I would like to give to my juniors is that don\u2019t cram a concept but understand it .This will help in solving even tricky and slightly twisted standard questions generally asked by Google. Moreover, please think out loud and communicate with the interviewer. The interviewer needs to know your thought process during the interview. And lastly, have confidence in yourself and give your best during those 45 minutes.\n\nThis is my LinkedIn profile : https://www.linkedin.com/in/vinay612agarwal/\n\nThis contains almost everything academic about my college life. Anyone can connect with me here if he/she has any doubt to clarify."

I am a final year student pursuing my B-tech in Civil Engineering from IIT Kharagpur.\n\nI have been offered an SDE role in Microsoft in the placement session 2021\u201322.\n\nI am from Morena, Madhya Pradesh.\n\nMy hobbies include singing and playing Table Tennis.\n\nHow did you get into Microsoft? What was the selection procedure?\n\nI was placed through campus placements.\n\nSo the first step was to submit a resume for Microsoft through ERP and then also we were shared a google form to fill out our details and rating on any coding platform like CodeForces or CodeChef.\n\nAfter this, all the students with having CG greater than or equal to 7.5 received an online test link.\n\nThe test was conducted on codility platform where copy-pasting was allowed even from outside sources, so you can solve questions on your personal IDE and can copy-paste on the codility editor.\n\nThere were 2 coding questions and the test duration was 90 minutes\n\nAfter it, about 45 students got shortlisted for an interview that was to be conducted on Day 1 i.e 1st Dec\n\nThere were 3 interview rounds. The first two were technical and the last one was HR.\n\nTechnical rounds were quite average in difficulty, where I was given some standard problems to solve, code, and explain the solution to the interviewer.\n\nIn the HR round, he told me to ask questions to him. I asked three questions to him regarding the company only and he gave very elaborated answers. After it, I got a call that I have an offer from Microsoft.\n\nHow to prepare for them?\n\nEverybody has a different preparation strategy. I will discuss my own.\n\nI have seen that Microsoft doesn\u2019t ask very difficult questions, neither in coding tests nor in technical interviews. So having enough practice with standard questions can lead you to get an offer here. You can solve questions in order of likes on Leetcode i.e from most liked as they are generally standard and Important questions to solve. You can follow this link\n\nLeetCode\n\nI started my preparation when I was not able to secure a CDC internship. so I had about 8 months to prepare for placements and prior to it, I had not much experience in coding. I started practicing from Leetcode only and used to do questions in a time-bound manner. On average, I did 3 questions daily and I think it is enough if you are consistent.\n\nTo improve my rating on Codeforces, I used to attend contests. I finally was able to have about 1550 rating and I think this much is okayish.\n\nMy primary focus was still Leetcode and I used to attend only contests on Codeforces.\n\nI also started doing Interviewbit when the interviews were near. and I think it is very very important to have gone through every question on Interviewbit. In the 2nd round of my interview, both of the questions asked were from the Array section of Interviewbit. So doing Interviewbit is a must.\n\nOther important things for interviews are OOP concepts and OOD design questions as nowadays many companies are asking about OOD.So having some experience in it will definitely help you\n\nThe basics of OS and CN are also important. And should be done before you appear for the interview.\n\nAccording to you, who should ideally apply for this job?\n\nAnyone who likes to solve problems and code them. Even if you don\u2019t have internship experience in the development field, you can still go for it.\n\nAny specific advice you want to give to the junta sitting for placements this year?\n\nI think getting a placement is not at all a very difficult thing to do. I was not able to secure a CDC internship. So if you have not gotten a CDC internship, don\u2019t get disappointed. Just be consistent, keep doing and improving and you will come off with flying colors."

I am from Chandrapur, Maharashtra. I will be joining Sprinklr as a Product Engineer at the Gurgaon office.\n\nHow did you get into Sprinklr? What was the selection procedure?\n\nI was selected in Sprinklr through the CDC placement process in the academic year 2021\u201322, Sprinklr was open for all the departments this year.\n\nThe first round was an online coding test. No CGPA cut-off was there, hence everyone who applied in the ERP was eligible to write this test. Three coding problems \u2014 one easy and two medium-hard \u2014 were given to be solved within 90 minutes in Hackerearth platform.\n\nAround 60\u201365 students were shortlisted for the interviews.\n\nSprinklr takes 4 interview rounds in general (3 Technical + 1 Culture fit). All rounds were eliminatory and lasted around 45 minutes. The interviews were mostly based on data structures and algorithms, OOPS, OS and DBMS concepts. Some questions were asked on projects and internships from the CV which were of interest to them.\n\n4 students were selected finally.\n\nHow to prepare for them?\n\nOne needs to have good problem-solving skills and understanding of data structures and algorithms.\n\nTaking the Algorithms course offered by the CSE department is beneficial. Geeksforgeeks is also a good website to learn CS concepts. To practice coding, start solving problems on codeforces.com. Leetcode.com has standard problems which are also helpful for the same.\n\nGiving online contests on this website is also very important. It teaches you to write the entire code, debug and consider the corner-cases too within the timeframe. Practice a lot. Solving all the questions quickly becomes important in placement coding tests because the competition is high.\n\nMake sure you give mock interviews before sitting for actual interviews in placements.\n\nWhat difficulties did you face while preparing for this Company/Profile? How did you overcome this problem?\n\nMost top companies look for students from the circuit department or the ones who are exceptionally good in coding. Therefore, to be a relevant candidate, I practiced a lot of programming from leetcode and codeforces. I also improved my CGPA, while learning some concepts such as DBMS and OS.\n\nAccording to you, who should ideally apply for this job?\n\nAll the technology enthusiasts and students who love coding should apply for this job.\n\nAny specific advice you want to give to the junta sitting for placements this year.\n\nStudy smart, practice a lot, prepare well. Getting selected in a particular company is not in your hands. A lot of external factors play a role in that. All you can do is work hard and improve yourself. Don\u2019t get demotivated as it will affect your preparation. Some days you will feel low, and it\u2019s completely okay. Take a small break and continue your preparation again. You will get good results. Believe in yourself. Make a study group if possible.\n\nGive mock interviews. Try to explain your code as much as possible. Spoon-feed everything to the interviewer; don\u2019t just assume that they will know about it since it\u2019s a basic thing. Communication skills are also important.\n\nWhat are some of the major points you think would be valid to mention while targeting this profile? (Any specific suggestions you would like to make?)\n\nMake your CV relevant to the profile you\u2019re applying for. Don\u2019t dilute your CV by adding extra non-related stuff. Also, write only those things which you are confident about."

        "content": "FORESIGHT(2022): Placement at Google| Tias Mondal\n\nBrief Introduction\n\nMy name is Tias Mondal, I am a final year dual degree student in the Department of Electronics and Electrical Communication Engineering, IIT Kharagpur. I have done my internship in Honeywell Technology Solutions Lab and am currently placed at Google.\n\nHow did you get into Google? What was the selection procedure?\n\nThe selection process of a software company is standard. They conduct, an online coding test first which consists of around two to four questions to be solved in a stipulated time and after that you have your three to four rounds of interviews. The interview basically judges you on your problem-solving skills and logical reasoning, so they test you on data structures and algorithms related skills and then if you are applying for some specific roles, then they may ask you CS core fundamental concepts like operating system, DBMS, networking etc. Not all companies ask all of the things that I mentioned, but DSA is necessary for software roles. So, the general template of any software interview is, DSA along with some CSE core fundamental concepts. But here Google is an exception. For new graduate roles, Google only asks DSA questions, no CS fundamental concept is asked and Google also makes this very clear from the beginning that they will only ask DSA questions. So that is all about it.\n\nNow, if I talk specifically about Google, Google has a very well-known template for new graduates SWE roles, so you have a sharp 45 to 50 minutes interview and within that duration you will be given one algorithmic question and you have to code it out and explain each and every part that you are writing. One thing that I will add here is that one beautiful thing about Google interviews is that most of the problems revolve around real world scenarios that Google engineers face in the actual software engineering roles. So, though they are DSA problems to be solved using some existing algorithms, they are real world engineering problems.\n\nComing to my interview rounds, in my first round, I was given a slightly challenging question based on trees and strings. If you can solve the question quickly, you can be asked one more question based on the amount of time available. Since I did that quickly, I was asked another question based on tree. That is where the round ended.\n\nIn the second round, I was again given a real-world engineering-based problem based on disjoint set union data structure. Initially I came up with a non-optimal solution and then had numerous discussions with the interviewer in optimizing the approach. Make sure while writing a solution, you find the corner cases or the cases in which the solution would fail rather than the interviewer doing that for you, we (Me and the interviewer) had discussion on various edge cases, time complexities, etc. The interviewer was super friendly and we also had discussions about different sectors at Google, about the work culture at Google, and that is where the round ended.\n\nIn my third round I was given a fairly easy question as compared to the other rounds which needed to be solved using maps. I did that quickly and after that again a fairly simple DP plus graph question, which is also a very standard one. The second part of this interview was the HR round of Google. The HR questions were also standard about what challenges you have faced in real life and all.\n\nHow to prepare for them?\n\nI would say, practice a lot of data structure and algorithm questions and if someone can do competitive coding, he or she will surely have an upper hand over others. Most of the companies ask DSA questions, but there are few selected companies like Google, media.net, Code Nation, Uber. These companies ask more competitive coding level questions rather than the standard leetcode type DSA questions. Do Codeforces rounds, They\u2019re super helpful. Try to solve till Code forces C to D level questions, these rounds will make your implementation super-fast and help you to clear almost every coding round. If anyone has time, I would ask you to go for Codeforces and Codechef, and when closer to your interviews and coding rounds, do leetcode. If you are well versed with your competitive coding, leetcode will be easier for you. If you are not able to come up with a solution, try to look into the editorial and this technique will help you further, If you get some similar question in future.\n\nAccording to you, who should ideally apply for this job?\n\nAnyone can apply for this job. The only requirement is strong problem-solving skills (Not only coding), Which I think a student can master in a year or so, given that he puts in a lot of effort and dedication towards his aim.\n\nAny specific advice you want to give to the junta sitting for placements this year.\n\nHere one suggestion that I would like to give to the students regarding the interviews is that just try to communicate your ideas clearly to the interviewer. It is your responsibility to make sure that your interviewer understands every line of code that you write. Also do not be quiet while writing code, explain each line, if possible, write brief comments in places you feel are complicated. Write meaningful variable names and clean code. All these points are particularly important because unlike many other companies, Google has a hiring committee which is formed by Google engineers who reviews the codes. So, the code that you will write will be reviewed by at least three Google engineers before your final decision on selection or rejection is made, which implies your code is your identity to the people in the hiring committee, so it should be clean and presentable and also try to make implementation faster. As for Google, the interviewer will not allow you extra time more than 45 minutes even if you have unfinished code. Try writing code, even if it is a brute force solution. You can optimize that later through discussion with the interviewer.\n\nI will just suggest the students who are preparing for the software roles to just PRACTICE & PRACTICE. Practice is the single most important key, so if you have time, do competitive coding. Do some hard \u2014 medium leetcode questions. and aim for the best and do not get demotivated in between, because in this field of competitive coding it is quite easy to get demotivated. So just try to make a group of friends who do competitive coding, together discuss solutions after contests, look into the editorials, and try to know the techniques. Even if you are not able to solve the question, try to know the techniques as these techniques will help you if a similar question comes, so practice is the key thing that you need to do if you are aiming for any role."

        "content": "FORESIGHT(2022): Placement at AlphaGrep| Satyam Sharma\n\nBrief Introduction\n\nI\u2019m Satyam Sharma. I am a final year undergraduate student pursuing my major in Mathematics and Computing at Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur. I was born and brought up in Chittaranjan, West Bengal.\n\nPreviously, I have interned with Mastercard as a software developer in the Data and Services Platform team. Post my second year, I also got an opportunity to work as a research and development intern at Centre for Artificial Intelligence and Robotics, Defence Research & Development Organisation (DRDO). Besides, I love exploring systems with a deep passion for Operating Systems.\n\nHow did you get into AlphaGrep? What was the selection procedure?\n\nI got placed at AlphaGrep through on-campus placement (CDC). It consists of one Online Assessment Round followed by one to two rounds of technical interviews.\n\nOnline Assessment: This is purely based on Data Structures and Algorithms. One can expect non trivial questions ranging from moderate to advanced level problems.\n\nHow to prepare for them?\n\nFor DSA, it is highly recommended to consistently appear for online contests. Not only can one improve their problem solving skill but also learn to solve problems within a given time frame, which from the placement point of view is perhaps the most important thing.\n\nI also relied upon leetcode for topic wise problem solving. I used to give 5\u20136 hours daily to solve roughly 7\u20138 problems a day. I used to re-solve a problem if my runtime was less than 40% and later used to refer to the best solution. This gave me an opportunity to learn alternative methods, new techniques and algorithms. Apart from this, I was blessed to have a mentor who was my hall senior. Everyday I used to discuss tough problems with him. To my juniors, get yourself a partner who might be your friend, senior or even junior. It isn\u2019t possible to solve every problem and preparation of DSA is time consuming. Everyday you can discuss the tough problems amongst yourself. This way you can solve twice the number of problems you would have solved otherwise.\n\nComing to topics from Core Computer Science, I followed my lecture notes. For reference material, I followed video lectures of Prof. Sorav Bansal, IIT Delhi for Operating Systems. Similarly for Computer Networks, one can refer to video lectures of Prof. Sandip Chakraborty, IITKGP and the book Computer Networks by Andrew S. Tanenbaum. For Computer Architecture, topics like Caching and Pipeline are extremely crucial and I followed video lectures by Prof Smruti Ranjan Sarangi, IIT Delhi. Other platforms like MIT OCW, Stanford Online are also a great place for students who are preparing for these topics.\n\nFor C++, learncpp.com is a great resource which discusses topics till implementation level.\n\nWhat difficulties did you face while preparing for this Company/Profile? How did you overcome this problem.\n\nWith a CGPA of 7.95 during my CDC internship, I faced multiple rejections as most of the companies in the initial days had a bar 8+ which obviously was extremely discouraging. For this reason, I focused on my academics a bit more for the next two semesters to make sure I crossed the bar. Though, for placements, this criteria is a little bit relaxed but again, the more the better.\n\nApart from this, the entire period of preparation is extremely monotonous and sometimes depressing. You have a lot to cover for placements along with managing your academics and Thesis Project. Also, I started my preparations from mid of July and placement tests started from the second week of October. So, with such a small time frame, it was difficult to cover the entire syllabus. Therefore I started group study with my batchmates during the month of November to prepare for topics which are comparatively less important from an interview point of view like Compilers, so that I could invest more time in other important topics. This turned out to be a good decision for me and helped me cover breadth quickly. Also throughout this period, being surrounded by my family, friends and seniors was an added support.\n\nAccording to you, who should ideally apply for this job?\n\nBased upon my experience of the industry, I am not sure if I would be the right person for this question, for me I don\u2019t have any first hand experience right now. In my case, I am really passionate about Software Development. Since my second year I developed a deep interest in Systems. I started kernel development in my third year. This introduced me to low level programming and eventually to some techniques for writing faster applications. Therefore, based upon the interactions with my seniors who work in the same industry I got to know that this role somewhat aligns with my interest, that it would give me an opportunity for further exploration. Working as a software developer in an HFT based organisation with like minded on systems where nanoseconds matters, gives one the exposure how stuff actually works under the hood and an opportunity to learn and write low latency codes. Therefore, HFT was on my preference list.\n\nAny specific advice you want to give to the junta sitting for placements this year.\n\nAs mentioned before, this period is going to be stressful and emotionally draining. Take this as an opportunity to develop your hard and soft skills. Don\u2019t stress over getting rejected in the OA rounds. Your performance in OA is a part of selection criteria which otherwise contains many other parameters. Just realise your mistake and work on it. During my placement, I realised many of us have imposter syndrome. We tend to judge ourselves based upon peers\u2019 preparation and their past achievements which directly or indirectly our confidence and plays a key role in placing ourselves in the rejection list. What really matters is your knowledge, your sincerity and dedication. Everyone is going to start from zero. Don\u2019t extrapolate your past, at the end how well you have prepared, how well you can defend your work and CV and how you have leveraged your college time would be the X-factor. Be confident and fight till the end. Placements don\u2019t decide your fate, and I have witnessed multiple examples of my seniors who weren\u2019t initially placed in their so-called dream companies and now grabbing multiple offers from top tech companies who once rejected them, thus bearing the testimony of this fact. Campus placement is just like an opportunity you get in your final year to get a headstart in your career, nothing more nothing less."

I am from Visakhapatnam, Andhra Pradesh. I will be joining BNY Mellon as a Software Developer.\n\nSelection procedure\n\nThe screening test consisted only of coding questions. Three coding questions were given and a time of 90 minutes was given in total. The questions were of medium difficulty from the topics Arrays, Graphs, and a hard problem from the topic Dp+Bitmasking. The students who solved all three got shortlisted.\n\nThe interview consisted of three rounds (2 Technical + 1 HR). The first round consisted of just 2 coding questions and I had to solve them in the Hacker rank platform where we had Run tests and submit options just like the screening test but here we had to code in front of the interviewer and explain him. The questions were easy to moderate level. The second round was also similar to the first round and consisted of 2 coding questions with a different interviewer but on the same platform. One question was moderate and one question was easy. I solved all four of them. The last round was an HR round with basic HR questions and some puzzles, which were quite easy.\n\nHow to prepare for them?\n\nFirstly, one has to be clear with all the concepts of Data Structures and Algorithms to get into a software developer role. The best platform to start DSA is Interviewbit. After solving Interviewbit fully start practicing in Leetcode, write weekly contests, and take as many mock contests as possible because writing the whole code and debugging under a time limit is very important and Leetcode provides a platform for Mock Contests. One more website which I found very useful was BinarySearch.com, which consisted of many good questions. I had a group of friends with whom I practiced coding so we used to start a mock contest with only hard questions, if anyone of us solved the questions everyone else would be able to see it in between the contest, so it became very competitive. Once you get a good hold on the concepts of DSA and solve many questions you can move to Codeforces or Codechef and start solving questions from there.\n\nWhat difficulties did you face while preparing for this Company/Profile? How did you overcome this problem?\n\nOne of the major problems in getting into a software developer role is competition. Getting shortlisted in companies would be tough even after solving all the questions one might not get shortlisted. To overcome this problem one has to give as many mock tests as possible so that one gets used to writing code within the timeframe, and also having a good CGPA and a good resume with decent projects is always an added advantage in getting shortlisted but not necessary. Having great coding skills is the most important factor to get into the Software Developer role.\n\nWho should ideally apply for this job?\n\nAnyone who has a passion for technology, interested in Fin-Tech and targets Software Developer Role can apply for this job\n\nWhat advice will you give to them?\n\nPlacement time is very hectic and people feel very frustrating but trust me all the hard work that you have put in will definitely give you results. Try to stay as calm and composed as possible during the interviews. Do good preparation and be confident, your preparation will definitely bring you great results. I would suggest everyone to form a group for practicing coding because I have learned many concepts while discussing with my friends, trust me you will learn many concepts when there is a group with the same passion to solve the questions. Don\u2019t get disheartened seeing your friends getting placed on Day 0 or Day 1, your time will come. ALL THE BEST!!!!"

I graduated from IIT Kharagpur in 2021 from the Department of Electrical Engineering. I was enrolled in the 4-year B.Tech course. I was a boarder of Rajendra Prasad Hall of Residence. Currently, I am working in Barclays Global Services as a Graduate Analyst in a technology role.\n\nHow did you get into Barclays? What was the selection procedure?\n\nI was selected in Barclays through the campus placement drive in 2020. The selection process consists of a test and two rounds of interviews. The test consists of various questions ranging from statistical analysis, mental ability, personality-based questions, and coding. The test gauges a candidate\u2019s knowledge in different fields.\n\nThe interview consists of two rounds- the first round is usually a non-technical round with questions like \u201cWhy do you want to work in the banking industry\u201d to gauge the candidate\u2019s genuine interest in the company and work profile. There are also questions about the recent technological advancements in the financial sector.\n\nThe second round is the technical round, where the interviewer asks about the technological skills of the candidate. There is a discussion on the candidate\u2019s CV if it contains projects/interns in a technology role. A good grasp of algorithms and data structures is essential to go through this round. Knowledge about Linux, operating systems, and database management is also appreciated and helps the candidate score more points. Still, they are not essential, and the interviewer will not ask questions if you mention that you don\u2019t have experience in those fields beforehand. Strong knowledge of JAVA and Object-Oriented Programming is a huge plus for this round.\n\nHow to prepare for them?\n\nGood CV preparation is essential to crack the Barclays interviews. A large number of questions are based on the candidate\u2019s experiences and skills related to technology. You should explain every project/internship you have worked on end-to-end and the technological skill-set you gained from those experiences. A firm grasp on algorithms and data structures is also important, and you should be able to solve any problem put in front of you in the most efficient way. Apart from this you should also have some understanding about the role of technology in the banking industry and the challenges/opportunities in the field.\n\nHow would you describe the work culture in your company? How is the work-life balance?\n\nI have really liked the work culture at Barclays ever since I joined the organization in August this year. You will be working with incredibly talented people, and every person in the organization is helpful. Some exciting projects are going on which provide a great learning opportunity to every newcomer. The aspect I particularly like in the work culture in Barclays is that even in the technical role, the emphasis is not only on the \u201cHow?\u201d of things but also on the \u201cWhy?\u201d of things. The business and technology side work very closely, which creates a perfect work culture allowing people to grow more through their work. The workload is not too much, and as a policy, they try to maintain an excellent work-life balance for the employees through proper workload management. You get ample time for your personal life after work.\n\nHow was your experience working from home? What difficulties did you face?\n\nWork from home can be a little tedious as you have to work alone in a room without any of your co-workers. The companies have adapted to this work-from-home routine very efficiently as there are regular team meetings and regular interaction between people. Luckily for me, by the time I joined Barclays, the complete lockdown was over, which made it a little easier as we could go out and hang out with our friends. But even then, working from home can be a real challenge for people who like to work in teams and constantly interact with others. Working in an office is a unique experience of its own as you get to meet new people, exchange ideas, and physically interact with your colleagues. Hopefully, soon we will be able to join our offices physically.\n\nAccording to you, who should ideally apply for this job?\n\nPeople who have a passion for technology and are interested in the Fin-tech field should apply for this job. The culture at Barclays also promotes understanding the project from both the business and the technology side. So, if you are interested in technology and its business implementation, Barclays will be a good fit for you.\n\nAny specific advice you want to give to the junta sitting for placements this year?\n\nMy advice to the people sitting for placements will be to remain calm and focus on their goals. The placement season can be very disheartening and frustrating at times, and we all who have gone through it have felt it. It is vital to stay calm and keep your cool during tough times. It is usually the people who persevere and keep working hard even after setbacks during the stressful times who crack the placement season. Have faith in your preparations and be confident. Confidence is the key to cracking any interview. It is imperative to note that you must get placed in the company and profile you want to work in. When you get placed is irrelevant to your future. So, it is entirely all right if you don\u2019t get placed in a Day 1 or 2 company."

I am presently working at Cisco.\n\nHow did you get into CISCO? What was the selection procedure?\n\nThe selection procedure has 2 phases, coding, interview.\n\nCoding: I was asked 2 coding q\u2019s, and some mcqs. Coding q\u2019s were medium in difficulty, anyone who prepared for placements can mostly do those, only problem is c++ stl is not allowed, I used python.\n\nInterview: I had 3 rounds total, 1 technical, 1 managerial, 1 hr round.\n\nIn technical one, they touched on the basics in os, networks, dbms, and asked me to implement code to 2 questions. They were of moderate difficulty, compared to previous coding rounds they were easy. The managerial round consisted of discussion around my CV, past experience, future plans, company culture fit, etc, this served as a behavioral round. The HR round consisted of just my interests and future goals and my priority for roles(application, network, embedded).\n\nHow to prepare for them?\n\nFor coding, I prepared from interviewbit, leetcode. I don\u2019t know if any better options are available this time. Especially for cisco, I would suggest practising some questions in python, as you would need it in the coding round. For os, networks, dbms, I used geeks for geeks and some course materials.\n\nFor interviews, doing mock interviews regarding projects, future goals, past experiences would help. In the managerial round, giving interviews peacefully being yourself, talking honestly and just having a nice discussion would help.\n\nHow would you describe the work culture in your company? How is the work-life balance?\n\nWork culture in cisco is pretty chill, working hours are flexible, attending meetings would be sufficient and u can set your own work timings. Work-life balance is good at cisco, the workload is not that much, also cisco came 2nd in fortune\u2019s best places to work in 2021. That says something about work-life balance here.\n\nHow was your experience working from home? What difficulties did you face?\n\nI had already spent two and half semesters from home, so I would say it\u2019s not that much new. Although I haven\u2019t been to the office yet, I am liking wfh so far. Plus is u get flexible hours, but the minus is lack of motivation due to the environment and difficulty with meetings etc. though eventually, it seems it will be hybrid.\n\nAccording to you, who should ideally apply for this job?\n\nFor me, there were 3 roles, application, network, and embedded engineer. If you wanna go for a software profile, there are more application-oriented roles, and also OS, networking oriented roles. There are few ml-related roles as well.\n\nIdeally, those who would want to work on os, networking related software would be suitable. Though there are a few pure application development related roles as well. Discussing with the manager during the interview about your future goals would be better.\n\nAny specific advice you want to give to the junta sitting for placements this year?\n\nAs It is around interview time already, being calm and performing your best gives you the best results. It is best to try to have honest and casual discussions during behavioral rounds. Just give your best, without worrying much.\n\nOfficial CV is attached as image format."

        "content": "FORESIGHT (2021) |Pre-Doctoral researcher at Google | Sohan Rudra\n\nBrief Introduction:\n\nHi, my name is Sohan Rudra and I am a Pre-Doctoral researcher at Google Research India where I work at the intersection of Reinforcement Learning and Robotics. I graduated this year from the Department of Mathematics (Maths and Computing) at IIT Kharagpur.\n\nHow did you get into Google? What was the selection procedure?\n\nI came across this position through a KGP senior who works at Google. Usually, during late September or October, the job position is published on the career page. I applied as soon as possible using an employee referral. The official interviews started in January (subject to change) and consisted of three rounds, namely coding, research and team-fit (all 45 minutes). The coding round consisted of standard Data-Structures and Algorithms style questions. The research interview round consisted of questions from the projects on my CV; and my chosen area of interest (Reinforcement Learning). After these rounds, a hiring committee decides whether the candidate meets the bar based on interview feedback. A team-fit-round commences after this. This round involves having discussions with potential managers. If both the parties (you and the team) agree on the fit, the company floats an offer.\n\nHow to prepare for them?\n\nFor research interviews (in Machine Learning), you need two things\n\n1) Total familiarization with the projects in your CV,\n\n2) Good clarity of the fundamentals of mathematics and machine learning. To re-familiarize myself with the projects in my CV, I scavenged through my documentation/papers and revisited all the nitty-gritty details in each one. As I was already in mathematics and computing, I have a background in relevant mathematical concepts of Machine Learning. I revised notes from my courses in probability, linear algebra, optimization etc. Apart from these, I referred to the following books for preparation, Cracking the Coding Interview by Gayle Laakmann McDowell, Deep Learning by Aaron Courville, Ian Goodfellow, & Yoshua Bengio and Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction by Andrew Barto and Richard S. Sutton. Also, it\u2019s helpful to remain up to date with the seminal works in one\u2019s research area.\n\nHow would you describe the work culture in your company? How is the work-life balance?\n\nThe work culture at Google revolves around people, collaboration and impact. One is always encouraged to solve problems that can have a huge impact on people. You will get to meet and work with many eminent researchers from all over the world. Everyone is very helpful, and no one is unreachable. The learning curve is quite steep but very rewarding. Also, the company makes various accommodations towards the mental health and well being of all its employees. The work-life balance is good; one can get ample amount of time for themselves after work. Managing time zones can be a bit challenging at times, as most of the projects are worked upon by several different teams from all over the world which requires effective collaboration from all sides.\n\nHow was your experience working from home? What difficulties did you face?\n\nWorking from home is challenging, not going to lie. Although teams try their best to facilitate open communication channels by having one-on-one and chill-out sessions, still it can never replace face to face conversations. Now that I have spent a week working from the office, I can firmly say; that the amount of enriching conversations that one can have by casually bumping into people or having lunch or coffee is not possible virtually. It also makes everything a bit more collaborative as you sometimes chit chat with your teammates and managers, brainstorm together and help each other solve problems. In WFH, one needs to be more alert about their well being, making sure that you don\u2019t get burnt out and always keep people informed by talking as much as you can with your team and managers. I struggled a lot with imposter syndrome, but\n\nAfter actively communicating with my manager, things changed for the better. In WFH conditions, communication and setting up proper schedules for yourself has become even more crucial.\n\nAccording to you, who should ideally apply for this job?\n\nThe pre-Doctoral researcher is a limited contract position with an aim towards helping people get relevant research exposure and preparing them for applying to a PhD program. So I would say this position is ideal for someone who has a keen interest in Machine Learning research and would like to explore the field more. Even people who are in stitches between academia and industry can apply and get more clarity.\n\nAny specific advice you want to give to the junta sitting for placements this year.\n\nEven though this blog is not about on-campus placements, but having gone through the process myself, I can understand the tremendous pressure that people are under during these times. The best advice from my side is to reach out as much as you can to your peers, parents, seniors, etc. Let people know when you need any help; for example, a couple of my friends (pass-outs at that time) recommended various books, looked at my CV countless times, helped me with interview processes etc. Also, I have seen people treat interviews like exams and try to cram their way into it, which is the completely wrong approach. They are like a conversation, and so there are no expectations that you have to know everything. Placements are a culmination of the four or five years of your college life, not the last four or five days. Hence, it is perfectly ok to say I have not worked on XYZ, so I don\u2019t know. And lastly, I know that it is difficult, but keep your mental health a top priority and take care of yourself. Going into the interview with a healthy mindset can make all the difference.\n\nOff campus and On campus CV are attached in image format."
