        "content": "FORESIGHT(2022): Placement at OLA | Compilation\n\n1) Brief Introduction\n\nMy name is Shikhar Goel. I am currently pursuing M. Tech from IIT Kgp in Thermal Science and Engineering Specialization(ME). I am working on a project with INTEL Co. Ltd which is based on laptop cooling. Apart from that, I have done several projects in CFD. Talking about my achievements I secured AIR 484 in GATE 2021 (ME).\n\nI am Somesh Shrivastava, 2nd-year M.Tech student of Electrical Engineering department under Control Systems Engineering specialization (2020\u201322 Batch), got placed with OLA Electric during the placement phase-I (December 2021).\n\n2) How did you get into Ola? What was the selection procedure?\n\nThe selection process was basically a two round process (as it is case for most of the companies), a written test and interview.\n\nThe written test was held online via an exam portal and it was a mix of technical and aptitude questions. Questions were objective type and easy to medium level, UG level questions.The short listing for technical interviews is based on the performance in the written test as well as the resume. Once the written round was cleared then one would be called for the interview round.\n\nInterview was also online and consisted of two rounds, technical round & HR round. Technical round was mostly about one \u2019s project work and theoretical background related to the project. Technical questions were from those subjects which were related to the project, while the HR round was all about one\u2019s social, professional and soft skills.\n\nFor the HR round, try to be calm and polite instead of being nervous . Also, try to make it interesting. These kinds of questions are asked in the HR round: What do you know about the company; Can you adapt to the company\u2019s environment; What do you know about the profile, etc.\n\n3) How to prepare for them?\n\nPreparing for aptitude and basic Electrical subjects would be enough for the written test, but aptitude needs to be practiced regularly and one should start it well before as it is the easiest part but requires time and dedication to attain speed and perfection. Preparation up to GATE and ESE level is sufficient as most of the questions are GATE or ESE PYQs.\n\nFor the technical interview, focus on projects and internships. Preparing one\u2019s project is the most important thing. Know your project well, what was the aim, what was done in the project, how things were done and the theoretical knowledge of each and every subject which was involved in the project work, going through the subjects at least once would be good. U must be well aware of all that has been written in your resume.\n\nHR round is just about oneself and one should practice how to frame answers well according to the situation. This is not an easy thing, but with\n\nenough practice one can definitely express oneself well in front of the interviewer. Many online sources provide such information for free like youtube, various blogs and articles etc. Just surf the internet once and one can easily get some good and well detailed sources.\n\n4) What all difficulties did you face while preparing for this Company/Profile? How did you overcome this problem?\n\nOne major difficulty many of the students face is where to prepare from, I started to prepare from UG level books, but after giving few tests I realized books were too much for the tests and such detailed theory is not required for the tests. One can find some website which have good objective type questions particularly whose level is same as the written tests. Also preparing for GATE level 1 mark questions from any test series of previous year question papers should be enough.\n\nAlso for HR round, youtube would be the best option (in case you do not have any subscription of inverview preparation courses).\n\n5) According to you, who should ideally apply for this job?\n\nPeople who are interested in working for core Electrical company or people who are interested in working for startups (as startups give challenging environment) can apply for this job.\n\n6) Any specific advice you want to give to the junta sitting for placements this year.\n\nGo for roles you are really interested in, do not fall for high salaries or what others are going for. Spending one\u2019s time and energy on a field which one is not well aware of and just started preparing a few months before the\n\nplacements just because the field is in trend would mostly result in a waste of time and energy. Better to prepare for roles you are confident about and about which you are sure you can fruitfully dedicate yourself into. Prepare aptitude well and practice regularly well before the placement starts, prepare the theory of subjects of the field you are interested in. Don\u2019t worry about interview from start of your preparation, just focus on doing well in the test first. If you find that you are getting enough time then prepare for interview and try to give some mock interviews.\n\nFor tests focus both on your technical and aptitude part. For interviews you can refer to youtube, there is a ton of good content just be confident in the interviews. If you don\u2019t have too many things on your resume then try to highlight the best things on your resume in your introduction."

I finished my B.tech from Mahatma Gandhi Institute of Technology as an Electronics and Communications Engineer in the year 2019. In my second attempt at GATE, I secured a rank of 859 in GATE 2020 EC and opted for Rf and Microwave Engineering at IIT Kharagpur.\n\nHow did you get into Texas Instruments? What was the selection procedure?\n\nTexas Instruments came for hiring through the on-campus CDC process for various domains such as software, hardware analog and digital. The hiring process involved an online test for shortlisting candidates and a 2 step interview that was held late at night. The first interview was for 90 to 100 minutes and the second interview took 45 minutes. The first interview was mostly based on the basics of digital circuits and questions of Verilog HDL, followed by an aptitude question in the end. The second interview was much harder than the first as it included concepts from both analog and digital design even though the job profile is of a digital engineer\n\nHow to prepare for them?\n\nWe guys from Rf and Microwave usually prepare for job profiles involving RFIC and VLSI (analog and digital). Most of us including myself have made use of NPTEL videos, Professor recommended textbooks, previous year\u2019s online test papers and also made note of topics from the interview experiences of our seniors. Apart from this, many students usually approach private online coaching to clear a few concepts but I didn\u2019t find it necessary. I mainly followed my class notes, tips and sources from my seniors, NPTEL videos and previous papers for both profiles.\n\nFor this domain, I would recommend Design of Analog CMOS Integrated Circuits by Behzad Razavi, NPTEL Digital Circuits by Prof.S.Srinivasan, NPTEL Hardware modeling using Verilog by Indranil Sen Gupta\n\nAccording to you, who should ideally apply for this job?\n\nAnyone who is passionate about VLSI design either analog or digital, who is capable of working a little bit harder to prepare for the interview, online test and beyond after joining and of course a little street smartness and aptitude is required\n\nAny specific advice you want to give to the junta sitting for placements this year?\n\nMy advice is to not think of the interview result or about the selection process while preparing for it. Try not to be anxious, days before the selection process. Keep your mind calm and peaceful because worrying about the job doesn\u2019t help you fetch the job. Try to help your friends in clarifying doubts and take help from them, be patient, be nice to people and maintain a positive atmosphere around you. At the end of the day it is always you vs you..so always try to do better than what you are doing today and one day when you will look back it will all make sense and you will know what I am talking about\n\nMy Best Wishes\u2026"

        "content": "FORESIGHT(2022): Placement at Bajaj Auto | G V Sai Harshit\n\nBrief Introduction:-\n\nI am G V Sai Harshit, enrolled in the dual degree course of Aerospace Engineering. I am a boarder of Lal Bahadur Shastri Hall of Residence. I got the placement offer from Bajaj Auto during the current placement season as a Post Graduate Trainee Engineer.\n\nHow did you get into Bajaj auto? What was the selection procedure?\n\nDespite being from Aerospace, most of my projects had an overlap with Mechanical subjects, and hence before the placement season started I decided to apply to core mechanical roles. As a backup, I was also preparing for business analyst roles.\n\nRegarding the selection process, most of the core companies in Mechanical have a screening test \u2014 Aptitude followed by Core Subject Questions. 30 min after the first written round, qualified students were sent another link to take the Psychometric Assessment. There are no wrong or right answers in this section and I believe only the consistency of answers will be checked.\n\nIn the interview, I was expecting technical questions related to vehicles and was not so confident as I had no experience. But luckily the interview was mostly based on my CV. Every small detail about the project was asked and I had to explain it to them in detail. They first asked me to describe my favorite project and its relevance in the current industry. Later minor details about all the projects were asked. They basically wanted to know how well I understood the projects and whether I have done the project myself.\n\nThe next round of interviews was the HR round, which lasted for roughly 5 minutes where they just asked for basic details and they wanted to know why I am not preferring higher studies despite having a good CGPA.\n\nHow to prepare for them?\n\nThe syllabus of the written test is the same as the syllabus for GATE Mechanical, but the focus will be more on 5 topics namely \u2014 Thermodynamics, Strength Of Materials, Machine Design, Fluid Dynamics, and IC Engines. These 5 topics would be enough to crack the exam. Some Aptitude questions were also asked and students are expected to be well-versed in aptitude as almost all job profiles test this aspect.\n\nFor the interview, just be very well-versed with your CV and don\u2019t mention anything that you can\u2019t justify. Prepare a good introduction and also be ready with questions that you will ask the interviewer after the interview. Both the introduction and the conclusion are essential as they paint a good impression. Be confident in your answers and everything will be fine.\n\nWhat difficulties did you face while preparing for this Company/Profile? How did you overcome this problem?\n\nBeing from Aerospace, I didn\u2019t have the knowledge regarding some Mechanical Gate concepts and I spent most of the Dusshera Holidays reading these topics and writing practice tests. Some of the questions will be direct formula based and one has to remember a lot of formulas and equations. Apart from that, I had doubts and fear regarding the placements but I was lucky to have good friends and family who constantly believed in me and motivated me to stay confident.\n\nAccording to you, who should ideally apply for this job?\n\nAnyone interested in the profile and having a profile something close to the job profile can apply. For Bajaj Auto, there is no need to have any prior knowledge about the working of a motor vehicle as was the case with me. I am not sure about the CGPA factor, but having a good CGPA definitely helps in core profiles.\n\nAny specific advice you want to give to the junta sitting for placements this year?\n\nIt\u2019s never too late to get started as I myself started preparing for the placements during the DP Holidays. Just put in the required effort and be confident in your abilities and skills. Don\u2019t be scared about the interview as you are not expected to know everything. And most importantly keep in touch with close friends and family, who will help you stay focused."

        "content": "FORESIGHT(2022): Placement at LAM Research | Vembakam Theja\n\n1\n\nBrief Introduction\n\nMy name is Vembakam Theja and I am currently pursuing an m.tech second year in IIT Kharagpur specialized in mechanical systems design. I did my B.tech in Jawaharlal Nehru Technological University; Anantapur specialized in mechanical engineering with an aggregate of 8.49 cgpa. My schooling and intermediate went in Tirupati itself which is my native place. In SSC, I secured 9.8 GPA and in intermediate, I secured 97.5 %. I have done my B.tech project on friction stir welding which is a unique way of welding technique that improves the fatigue strength of the material compared to other usual welding processes. I did an internship in the Visakhapatnam steel plant in the sector of raw material handling plant. In addition to the sector which has been assigned to me, I have also visited other sectors of the plant where I came to know what all the various processes involved in the making of steel and how exactly steel is manufactured. Currently I am doing my m.tech project on data analytics for fault diagnosis. Using this project we can predict fault in any machine beforehand and can reduce losses to the company. My hobbies are playing chess, listening music and writing fantasy stories.\n\nHow did you get into LAM Research? What was the selection procedure?\n\nThe company has selected candidates through a Resume shortlisting. That resume shortlisting is based on my projects and skill set (Catia, Creo).\n\nThe interview procedure has two rounds\n\nIn the technical round, they completely focused on my B.tech and m.tech projects. They asked me all the possible questions in my projects and some mechanical core-related questions.\n\nIn HR round they will test you on whether you are greedy towards money or greedy towards skills. They need the guys who are ready to opt for new technologies and new concepts instead of the guys who are greedy for money. They will put you in some situations and ask you how you will handle that situations. For example, they asked me what if a new challenge has been given to you which is completely new to you but we need very good output from you, how can you match up our expected output. Like this, they will put you in some situations and test your approach toward the solution.\n\nHow to prepare for them?\n\nYou have to be clear about your projects and you should be able to explain your projects in such a way even a layman can understand what you have done.\n\nBe particular about the results of your project, and note down what results you got in your projects, is there any unique thing you added or obtained using your project. For example in my case, in my B.tech project we proved that friction stir welded products are having high strength compared to other welding processes.\n\nAlso be thorough with your B.tech core subjects.\n\nWhat difficulties did you face while preparing for this Company/Profile? How did you overcome this problem?\n\nThe only problem everyone faces is fear. Not only LAM Research but any company does not ask difficult questions. They just ask basic questions about the project and our core subjects. Due to fear or interview pressure, you may tend to forget what you have known and cannot present yourself properly. I reminded myself that they are not aliens and just humans. In my case, I went with the mindset that I am not going to get this job. I had no fear when I went for the interview because I thought when I knew that I am not going to get this job, why to afraid. When you go for a job interview, there is an intention that I need this job, because of that you tend to give diplomatic answers. I just talked with my heart and said what I think. I presented all the knowledge, whatever I knew. I tried to keep a jovial environment, presented myself with whatever knowledge I had and without fear gave the interview. When you forget fear you can completely focus on the questions they are asking. You are free to explain, and it will become a discussion instead of an interview, they also try to correct you and give different perspectives. If I did not know the answer, instead of saying I don\u2019t know, I smartly said that it was a very interesting question; I never thought about it but will surely try to figure out the solution regarding this.\n\nAccording to you, who should ideally apply for this job?\n\nThere is no need for an ideal profile. Everyone can apply. Everyone is talented, so the way you present yourself decides your chances of getting selected.\n\nAny specific advice you want to give to the juniors sitting for placements this year.\n\nI think everybody has the knowledge, only because of fear they are not able to present it properly. So try to avoid fear. Keep in mind that you are studying in a prestigious college like IIT Kharagpur, so you will definitely get a job. Do not fear for your job. If not here, there are numerous opportunities outside. Just make sure that you maintain a positive atmosphere during your interview. Be honest but your honesty should not create a negative atmosphere. Try to make them feel good about you. Maintain some humour throughout the interview.\n\nWhat are some of the major points you think would be valid to mention while targeting this profile? (Any specific suggestions you would like to make?)\n\nProjects are very important. Based on the projects only, candidates are shortlisted. The company mainly focuses on the B.tech/M.tech projects. Present the projects in a way that they can understand. Do not make it complicated. Keep it simple to be understood."

I got placed at Mercedes-Benz Research & Development India during the Phase 1 placement season of 2021\u201322 and I will be joining the company as a Post Graduate Engineer Trainee(PGET) in Mechanical from August 2022.\n\n2. How did you get into MBRDI? What was the selection procedure?\n\nThe company conducted its online test on the 27th of November. It consisted of 40 questions where the first 20 questions were those of General Aptitude and the next 20 were core mechanical engineering questions. 18 students qualified for the online test and they were selected further for the interview process on the 3rd of December. The interview process consisted of 3 stages: the first stage was the Technical interview where there were 3 panelists who asked me to introduce myself first and then asked questions on basic subjects like Strength of Materials, Structural Analysis, and Finite Element Modelling. After this, I had my second interview which was a Managerial interview with one interviewer. He asked me questions about myself, my background and more about my hobbies. He also asked me some basic interview questions like those about my future plans, conflict resolution in the workspace, why I would like to join the company, etc. The third interview was the HR round where the HR representative called me to tell me more about the company, the CTC, the job location and the perks of the job.\n\n3. How to prepare for them?\n\nFor the online test, prepare for the General Aptitude section as you would for any competitive exam like GATE with varied topics like verbal ability, permutation and combination, work and time, etc. For the core mechanical questions, keep your foundation throughout all 4 years of engineering very strong because they ask only the basic questions. Next for the Technical interview round, again keep your basics clear as they ask more of \u201chow\u201d or \u201cwhy\u201d questions than \u201cwhat\u201d questions. They only try to test your approach to a problem and how you analyze a question rather than what your final answer is. They also asked me questions about FEM and simulations in ABAQUS. For the Managerial interview, prepare all basic HR questions like where do you see yourself in 5 years, tell me more about yourself, your strengths, weaknesses and be prepared to answer questions about your CV.\n\n4. What difficulties did you face while preparing for this Company /Profile? How did you overcome this problem?\n\nThe only problem that I faced while preparing for the placements was the vastness of the engineering syllabus. Covering the entire syllabus of the four years of engineering is a difficult task but I had already written GATE so I started revising the portions early on and since I had studied all the subjects in prior, I had my basics of civil engineering clear.\n\n5. According to you, who should ideally apply for this job?\n\nAccording to me, all the non-circuital branch students who are interested in research and simulations can apply for this role because they ask the most basic mechanical questions like those included in Strength of Materials and Mechanics of Solids that any non-circuital branch student can easily answer. I am saying this because I myself am a Civil Engineer and I applied for the Mechanical Engineering position.\n\n6. Any specific advice you want to give to the junta sitting for placements this year?\n\nMy advice is to not get demotivated or lose hope if you are not selected in any of the initial companies which come because opportunities are always there ahead in your future or fate may call you somewhere where you belong and you will be happy. I also suggest keeping multiple backup options and not relying solely on acquiring a particular position at a particular company but try for multiple companies, write multiple government exams, and also try for an offline recruitment process and never giving up hope.\n\n7.

I was a student of the Mechanical Engineering Department, enrolled in its B-Tech Course. The major Extra-curricular activity I was involved in during my college life was TeamKART, IIT Kharagpur. I became a part of it right in my first year and continued till my final year.\n\nHow did you get into JLR? What was the selection procedure?\n\nI got placed in JLR, during the Campus Placement Season of December 2020. The selection procedure was quite basic,\n\nA Written Test (Aptitude + Coding +Mechanical Core (only for the core profile))\n\nSOP Submission and Personal Interview\n\nThe test features regular GATE level questions for mechanical core. The test pattern in Aptitude and mechanical core were adaptive. Questions are of three difficulty levels and when you answer a question correctly you get a question of increased difficulty and when you answer a question wrong, the difficulty level drops in the next question.\n\nHow to prepare for them?\n\nMechanical Core Test: Practice gate level questions for all the domains of mechanical engineering taught across the 4 years. Keep your concepts clear rather than remembering the formulas. Companies tend to ask conceptual questions more than calculation based. Expect some calculative question though\n\nAptitude Questions: Practice different types of aptitude questions (Quantitative and Logical).\n\nCoding: Coding questions are not very advanced level, basic questions that are found online for practice will do for the preparations.\n\nInterview: KNOW YOU CV INSIDE OUT. Prepare for core questions which are related to the projects you have written in your CV. Prepare a fluent introduction of yourself and your CV in advance.\n\nAlso Prepare HR questions in advance like Strengths, weaknesses and Where do you see yourself in 5 years, etc. Finally, MOCK INTERVIEWS ARE A MUST. You will get to know the level of our confidence properly only after giving some mock interviews.\n\nHow would you describe the work culture in your company? How is the work-life balance?\n\nThe Work Culture at JLR India is all you can ask for. Being a part of JLR India doesn\u2019t mean you are confined to working with the India team, new graduates like us also work directly with the core UK team. Everyone is very approachable and open to discuss new ideas. Research is also pursued with great enthusiasm. We never feel like we are just Graduate Engineers, everyone\u2019s opinions are valued. In terms of Work-Life Balance, we are always encouraged never to work outside of working hours. The UK team is also very understandable in managing the Time-zone gap and we generally don\u2019t have to work late. So in all the balance is pretty good.\n\nHow was your experience working from home? What difficulties did you face?\n\nWorking from home is a very debatable subject. Some people feel comfortable working from home while some prefer the office work environment. Personally I don\u2019t enjoy working from home, because I had to do my internship online due to a pandemic and then the rest of the College activities happened online so I always wanted to start working in an office environment. Also collaboration is very difficult. We have to set up calls and meetings for very small discussions which can easily be done personally without wasting a lot of time in office space. Plus, it is difficult to generate interest when you have to stare at your screen for 8 hours, when you are working from home.\n\nAccording to you, who should ideally apply for this job?\n\nThe Automotive Industry is moving towards a more Software oriented philosophy with the advent of Electric vehicles and satisfying customer needs. So only people with mechanical interest can apply for this job is now a myth. Anyone who has interest in product engineering, system engineering, even AI and coding can apply for the job. A lot of interesting and cutting edge technologies are being worked on in the industry, which previously were far from the needs of the automotive industry. But not anymore."

        "content": "FORESIGHT (2021) |Application Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) Engineer at Western Digitals |Shiva Surya\n\nBrief Introduction:\n\nHi, I am Shiva Surya. I finished my B tech from Electrical Engineering in 2021. I am currently working at SanDisk, Western Digital as an ASIC Engineer (ASIC = Application Specific Integrated Circuit).\n\nHow did you get into Western Digital? What was the selection procedure?\n\nI got an offer from Western Digital during the Campus Placement process in my final year. The selection procedure consists of 2 stages.\n\n1st Stage was a written exam of 1hr duration, and students had to answer 45 questions of Analog Electronics in 30 minutes and 45 questions of Digital Electronics in 30 minutes.\n\n2nd Stage consisted of 4 Interview rounds. The 1st round is based on Digital Electronics for a duration of 45 mins. The 2nd round is based on Analog Electronics for a duration of 1hr 15 mins. 3rd round had both Analog and Digital based questions, and some of them needed expertise in both (Mixed Signal Electronics) which lasted for 1hr. The 4th round was an HR round for a duration of 30 minutes.\n\nHow to prepare for them?\n\nFor the first stage written exam, speed is important. The content of the exam was taught in Analog Electronics, Digital Electronics, Signals, Networks and some additional things like Verilog coding and Mixed-Signal Electronics need to be learned. Most of the questions can be answered directly with a bit of thinking.\n\nFor the Digital Electronics round, I need to be thorough with Digital Electronics concepts taught in the course. Along with that, I need to know how to implement those circuits (Logic Circuits and State Machines) in Verilog. For Verilog, I recommend Hardware Description Languages for FPGA Design on Coursera. The Analog Electronics round needs to be thorough with concepts taught by Professor Bibu Datta Sahoo sir. If they are not taught by him, there is a playlist on YouTube by Professor Behzad Razavi. Along with that, I need to solve problems from Behzad Razavi Electronics book (Design of Analog CMOS Integrated Circuits).\n\nNOTE: Analog Electronics must be learned from these 2 professors because they teach some techniques specifically used in engineering fields. For the third Mixed-Signal Electronics round, one needs to know the basics of CMOS circuitry and how Digital Logic is designed using CMOS. For Mixed Signal electronics, I recommend a course by Professor Ashis Maity which is taught in Autumn Semester. He gives a very good introduction to how the Electronics industry works and how the concepts we learned get applied in the Industry.\n\nThe HR round is light and peaceful because it is a core profile. Optional: I recommend subscribing to newsletters from companies like Texas Instruments, Analog Devices. That way you will be aware of the latest technologies, and we will get to know some good circuit ideas.\n\nHow would you describe the work culture in your company? How is the work-life balance?\n\nIt has been 5 months since I joined the organization and everything seems good so far. It feels good to be surrounded by \u201ccore people\u201d. You will get enough time and enough guidance to learn a lot of new things. Work-life balance depends on the stage of the project. If it is in its early stages, life is peaceful, which is the case for most of the time. If the project is near to tape out, then sometimes you have to work on weekends, which is like 2 or 3 weekends for a span of 6 months.\n\nHow was your experience working from home? What difficulties did you face?\n\nIt takes more time to complete a task sitting at home than working in an office, as a result, overall productivity is less in work from home. Company and Managers are trying their best to reduce the workload during this work-from-home session. If everything goes right, I will be called to the office in January or February 2022. I hope Omicron doesn\u2019t turn out to be a dangerous variant. As for difficulties, Electrical Engineering was tough, but it was worth it since my job is in a core profile. Covid hit our family from August to October in 2020, so it was a bit difficult to get out of that slump and write the exams in such a short time.\n\nAccording to you, who should ideally apply for this job?\n\nPeople who are interested in the Electronics profile should apply for this. My work includes designing new Digital Logic in Verilog, alongside implementing already existing circuits like (Comparator, MUX. PLL, etc.) in new technologies with a bit of coding\n\nAny specific advice you want to give to the junta sitting for placements this year?\n\nAll the best to you guys. You will surely find a job somewhere you like and something you want to work for. The tough part of acquiring all the important skills is over. All that is left is to find something where you can apply them. It may take some time to get that job you were longing for, but you will get it sometime, just need to have some patience. The selection preference is also high for guys with a Ph.D. or a Master\u2019s Degree compared to BTech guys in the core companies. So be aware that there are fewer opportunities per year in the core sector compared to the software/IT sector. Do not restrict yourself to CDC placements, as only a few core companies visit campus. Apply for companies off-campus through LinkedIn or some websites like Monster jobs etc.\n\nIf a job is compulsory for you, keep learning some Software basics. Learn a programming language, preferably C++, and basic Algorithms. Attend the classes regularly and learn stuff taught by professors, they are used in real life. If you get to go to the campus, do enjoy yourself with your \u201cNakama\u201d. For core guys, do participate in your hall\u2019s hardware modeling since you will learn some cool stuff that can be learned exclusively by core guys (like Raspberry Pi for example).\n\nOfficial CV is attached as image."

        "content": "FORESIGHT (2021) |Shakul from Dr Reddy\u2019s Laboratories\n\nBrief Introduction :\n\nHi! I am Shakul. I was privileged to have spent some of the best couple years of my life on campus as a Dual Degree student in the Chemical Engineering Department during which I gathered some interest in the research on the micro/mesoscale phenomena. I decided to work on the R&D side of Chemical Engineering and ended up joining the PhD Program in ChemE at MIT. When I\u2019m not working, I usually like enjoying food, going out for walks or watching anime.\n\nHow did you get into Dr Reddy\u2019s Laboratories? What was the selection procedure?\n\nThe placement process is not very uncommon. It was conducted in a virtual way for us. Dr. Reddy\u2019s has a shortlisting test, which tests your core concepts along with some chemistry (afaik it was mostly polymers) along with a logical reasoning part (pattern identification mostly).\n\nThen, there is a GD round which is usually more technical and requires you to discuss as a team and come up with a solution within a reasonable time limit. While on one hand it is good to come forward and speak, you need to ensure that you do not cut others off. Also, few ingenious points go a long way compared to a barrage of obvious things.\n\nAfter the GD, there was only one interview round which involved questions from your resume, previous internships and HR-related things.\n\nHow to prepare for them?\n\nFirst of all, it is best to have an idea of whether you are interested in core CH or not. If you are, then try to pay attention to the key ideas delivered in the class. Also, try to maintain a good CGPA. I guess anything over an 8 should be a good sign. Finally, make sure you get hold of some good notes (books would be too daunting) on the major Chemical Engineering areas \u2014 Reaction Engineering, Mass Transfer and Fluid Mechanics in particular. Study from the notes to revise the fundamentals. Try to keep an open mind during the interview.\n\nHow would you describe the work culture in your company? How is the work-life balance?\n\nBased on what I\u2019ve heard, Dr. Reddy\u2019s offers decent work-life balance. The cultural aspects could change over time and I feel it is best to ask the folks currently working in the company.\n\nHow was your experience working from home? What difficulties did you face?\n\nWorking from home seems like a great idea at first but I was constantly missing out on all the fun. Work-from-home settings tend to leave you in circumstances where you are too bored or lazy to work because of the inverse effect of working too much. I tried to balance my productivity by taking short breaks (naps), organizing brainstorming sessions and staying connected with friends.\n\nAccording to you, who should ideally apply for this job?\n\nThe ideal candidate would be one who is interested in pharmaceutical manufacturing. The company appears to value those who have had some experience (in relevant\n\nacademic/industrial pursuits) and those who display knowledge and interest in production challenges (Process Engineering).\n\nAny specific advice you want to give to the junta sitting for placements this year.\n\nOne of the biggest hurdles between you and that offer is your own doubt.\n\nOfficial CV is attached in a image format."
