[{"blog_id":1,"blog_text":"Subham Rajgaria Placed at McKinsey and Co. Interviewed By: Mr. Subham Rajgaria from IIT Kharagpur, was recently placed in Mckinsey as a consulting analyst. Communiqu\u00c3\u00a9 IIT Kharagpur, interacted with him on the interview process and the strategy he adopted for its preparation. Here, we present you a glimpse of the brief interaction we had with him. We thank Mr. Rajgaria for spending his valuable time with us for the same.So, Subham, What was the general interview process for companies you interviewed? Please mention the number of rounds and the nature of the interview process. Sure. Mckinsey has this portal which was released just around August where you will have to send your cover letter and your resume. So based on these, they shortlist around 15 students after which they conduct a buddy session. What happens in the buddy session is that 2 people from the company who might be your alum, might be alums of other colleges, like 3\u00e2\u20ac\u201c4 yrs senior to you, help you in the process of preparing for the interview, which will be coming up later. What happens in these types of interviews for consultancy companies is that you have case interviews, where you are given a scenario, which might be about the problems with the company, lets say the revenues are falling, or someone has launched a new product, and you have to identify the problem and give recommendations. The buddies help you prepare for such cases and gives you some tips about how to go about this process. After this, there was a round with some of the people at Mckinsey. That was round 1. That was around 11th of September.In between we had 15\u00e2\u20ac\u201c20 days with the buddies. This time it was a little short. Last year, my seniors had a longer period, the interview was in October. Was the buddy session evaluated? The company will tell you that it is non-evaluative, however I am not sure. There might be a 50\u00e2\u20ac\u201c50 chance that the buddy might put that he has done well in the buddy session, so it is important to take care during these buddy sessions and actually do them well. So, on 11th of September, we had round 1, I had 2 rounds of interview on that day with a few other people at Mckinsey. Some of my seniors and batch mates had 3 rounds, depending on how well their interviews were. Finally, they shortlisted 5 people for the partner round, where partners from Mckinsey take your interview. So that happened on 13th On that day, again, I had 2 rounds of interviews, both were partner rounds. So, this was the general interview process, with the final round on 14th of Sept. This was the entire process. Could you please list down questions were you asked in the different rounds? Puzzles, technical questions, any other discussion in general that you think will prove to be helpful for students. Sure, as I mentioned earlier, these are generally case interviews. Case interviews is identifying problems.Apart from case interviews, what they ask is our guesstimates. For eg, you will have to guess how many planes are flying in India or a question which I was asked in the first round was, what was the market size of the e-commerce business in India. So, what is important here is that depending on the interviewer, he may not be looking for the exact number, but the process behind it- approach. So, it has to be logical, structured, it is not something that you just come up with a number in your mind. Even if the number is correct, that does not say that you are a good candidate. But if your logic is correct and you might hit the number by a factor of 10, it usually works out and is worth more. In the 2nd Interview of the 1st round, there was a sort of an HR question, like we already had a device planned for a bank, we have to make sure that the banks employees follow it. So, I was asked that this scheme, which was proposed by Mckinsey is followed by the client. So, these were some of the questions and normal case interview questions can be easily found in the case interview books, such as CIC by IIT Bombay, IIT Madras Day 1.0. This are the books which the candidates can refer to and have more idea about how case interviews are. They did not ask any puzzle as such, but they do ask a lot of HR questions, like, why do you want to join consulting, or tell me something about yourself which is not on your CV. Its not very typical, they don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t ask your strengths and weaknesses, they might, but rather they will ask you, something that you really work hard for that you cherish it now that you did that through your hard work, or where you show leadership. Candidates should prepare for these types of questions because these can be asked at every interview. Is there any resource where candidates can prepare for HR? I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think there is something for HR. HR rounds are mostly done by CV itself. I think you should be thorough with your CV, you should be clear why you took a decision at a particular point of time. If you have done do a FT, it should not be only because of the academic part, you should not only talk about academic part, but how it helped to develop your personality. What I think is, candidates should try to bring a holistic experience in what they tried out during their stay at IIT Kharagpur. Do not only look at one aspect. There is no specific resource which I can point out, but being thorough with your CV and yourself is the most important part. What are some of the FAQs in most companies that you faced and think students must definitely prepare for? More specifically, in the context of HR rounds. You should sort out where you have shown leadership, what did you do to demonstrate that you are out of the crowd. Everyone is unique. You need to bring that out in front of the people.So, you should write down the points, in case you are asked these questions.Apart from that, each and every question was different. What are things students sitting for placements next year can do from now until December to maximize their chances of getting through a company in this sector? Initially, I was preparing for both the software job and consultancy job. It is very difficult to manage both which I realized from my personal experience. So, I would suggest that the candidates should clear it out which kind of job they want and which sort of companies they want to target because it is almost impossible to target all kinds of companies. It is very difficult because there are a platform of opportunities in IIT Kgp. Once they start preparing for different kinds of job profiles, they will understand what job they want and this should be very clear to them at the beginning itself. To maximize the chances of placement, once you choose, be thorough with that, follow the specific routines. Everyone knows the basic types of questions in each type of profile, so prepare accordingly. Practice well, give your best. When did you think of going into consultancy? I guess I thought of joining consultancy once I started. I had applied for BCG. Then I talked with some of my alums and thought that it is a very exciting job.I thought of giving it a shot, so I started preparing around last part of July and 1st week of August, and I really enjoyed doing those case interviews. That is what tempted me to actually prepare for it. I was simultaneously working for my software job as well. It was difficult for me, so I suggest the future candidates to try to figure this out early, but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s OK if you can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t figure it out even till placement time, if you can manage both, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s great, you can have many opportunities and finally decide. If you can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t, I would say, it is better to decide as early as possible. What were the strategies which helped a lot in the process of preparation? The most important part was solving puzzles and doing those case interviews. When you solve a case interview, you find out a problem, or if you solve a puzzle, may be related to probability or common sense, it keeps you thinking and helps you grow. These kinds of puzzles improve your thinking and there are many approaches to each and every problem. These puzzles motivate you to learn more. Initially, you may not be able to solve the puzzles, but once you start getting it, it makes you feel good and try on more. It makes you feel positive. After coming to IIT after JEE, many people lose the spirit and zeal to solve problems like in the JEE days. But if you keep practicing, this will motivate you to learn more. How effective and important was the case group? The case groups and the buddy sessions are very important and are the core thing of a consultancy job. Buddy sessions help you know what kind of cases that company may ask. They try to help you to come into the firm. A buddy generally gives you the cases which have arisen before or are generally asked in companies. Also, forming a case group and solving it with different people helps you to get different lines of thought from different people. This way, you can understand how many different ways of approach can be possible for a problem. The interviewer might ask you to solve a problem in different approaches. So, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s good if you listen to the approaches of different people. It helps you in the interview. What should be the number in case group? For the case groups, I would say 3 or 4. 2 is a bit biased, because it becomes monotonous, you are only exchanging ideas with each other, 3 is more balanced, you can pair up alternatively and this helps you better. In the initial stages, you can listen to both sides, act as an interviewer and interview someone else. That part is also important because you have to guide the interviewee to the answer. It requires a lot of thinking from the interviewer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s perspective as well. Sometimes, I may twist a case, so that it becomes more difficult, that might lead to different possible answers and different possible suggestions. How did your preparation for technical rounds evolve once you were shortlisted? There is no technical round in Mckinsey, but there is another round which did not happen this time. There is a problem-solving ability test which is conducted specifically by Mckinsey, but due to the shortage of time, this time, it did not happen. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s usually Mathematics and Analytical test. There are some basic form questions, apart from which there are paragraph questions, which you have to read and give analytical answers. There are 30\u00e2\u20ac\u201c35 questions and you are given only 30 minutes. It is generally tough because you have to do it very fast. In case this round is held, do the candidates need special kind of preparation? It takes place after you complete Round 1. After round 1, they give you some sample papers, doing that would be enough, it will give a basic idea about that. Other than consultancy, did you look for any other profile? Yes, for software job there was definitely a checklist. Subjects like Operating Systems, Networks, Database Management systems are very important for placements. These were definitely on my checklist. Apart from that Algorithms and practicing coding on Interview-bed or e-port were in my checklist. Some basic questions of probability were ls very important, almost all the companies ask these types of questions. If not a consultancy company, I was looking for companies like Google, Microsoft. But I was looking more for the companies on front side, where there is less of development. I did not find development very appealing to me, so I was looking for companies having con roles if I had to sit for placements. Anything else that you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d want to share with the students? Be honest with yourself, it is very important that you realize where you are standing. Do not try to get deceived, for eg, it is very easy to copy-paste code from somewhere. But doing it from a scratch is difficult in the beginning, but afterwards you get a grip. Always be alert about where you are standing among the people. It is very important to interact with people and get to know where are they preparing from so that you are on the same level. That is the general funda I would like to give. What were your involvements in Kgp for the past 4 years? I have been part of Business Club, I have done a number of Case studies, which are different from case interviews, but general problem-solving skills came to me through Business Club.It improved by presentation skills, confidence. This has really helped me along with my friends here. Projects and presentations should not be neglected because it helps at the end of the day. Thank you a lot for spending some valuable time of yours in sharing your experience. Thank you. Back to list","category":"Placement","profile":"Consulting","department":"Computer Science and Engineering"},{"blog_id":2,"blog_text":"Mayank Srivastava Placed at Auctus Advisors Interviewed By: So my first question to you, Mayank, is what were the general interview process for the companies you interviewed. Please mention the number of rounds and the nature of the interview process. Regarding my interview process for the companies I focused as a prime during my placement semester. So, consultancy was my target from my 4th year. For the same I interned at KPMG as a consultant and strategist and in that I got a good essence of what a consult firm does apart from the kind of projects that can be given to the people who work in consultancy firms. So, following the same, I made my whole plan for placement in the semester to focus majorly on the companies which look for case solving abilities in candidates. So, general interview process for those consults or the companies which look for solving cases and all is generally in 3\u00e2\u20ac\u201c4 rounds, depends on the nature of the job and the nature of profile you are going to get. So in that one round is HR which is kind of, you know, in HR round they try to focus a lot in knowing the fact whether you are really interested in this profile or not and what change can you bring as an individual if you join the company. Apart from that suppose I also appeared for the APM profile of Flipkart. So in that there is a technical round as well. One round was product case round, one round was simple analytical round in which estimates & all are asked, and one was obviously HR round. So Mayank my next question is could you please list down questions which were asked to you in different rounds, whether it is a technical question or any other general question you think will be helpful for the students. Like some examples of a few of the questions you feel important. Okay so again I would like to suggest all the students that if you start preparing for any company, or any profile, just don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t make your plan just to focus on the profile you are going for. Your plan should be company relevant, not process relevant. So, again I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll give the example of the consulting firms which I interviewed in. In that, the rounds are mainly, you know if I take the example of Auctus Advisors, one round is purely guestimate & analytical reasoning in which they try to know whether you are good with numbers or not. And in the second round they try to know the, you know there is a decision making round in which they give different scenarios which can arise in different kinds of projects, such kind of life problem scenarios are asked and you have to take the right decision. So using the decision tree algorithms and other technical skills you need to figure out which decision would be the most beneficial. The third round was the case round. A case round in which marketing case or market entry profitability case were asked. So this was for consulting firms. For profiles like APM, they try to know your technical skills as well apart from the case solving abilities. In technical skills you need to understand how applications and websites work at the back-end. What are the features that nowadays technology is adapting a lot to, for example the GPS system, how does the GPS system work? What is the algorithm for pricing in Uber. These kind of questions were asked in APM. APart from that they asked puzzles. Puzzles are something that everyone should practice because not only in consultancy firms but also in many other profiles puzzles are asked to understand whether you have the ability to understand, or rather, do you have the analytical ability to solve the problems which can come to you during your time of job. Thanks Mayank for these two questions and can you list down some of the resources which you find relevant for consulting firms? Like preparation material from which they should refer. Suppose I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m a beginner or completely noob in this field and I feel that I should go for it, so how should anyone prepare? So for consulting firms the preparation is a 2\u00e2\u20ac\u201c3 step process. First is you should understand this i.e. start getting the feel of consultancy firm. For that I will strongly suggest that do one intern in consultancy firm so that you understand what happens inside. However if you want to directly start with preparation, first of all what my plan was that I have always read a book as a bible for any profile I have learned. So for consultancy, Case Interview Cracked from IIT Bombay was my bible. However apart from that there are 3\u00e2\u20ac\u201c4 more books like IIM Case Interviews, then there is one from, like this there are 3\u00e2\u20ac\u201c4 more books. CIC was my main book which I tried to focus on. On that you will get to know that there are 4\u00e2\u20ac\u201c5 categories of different case questions that can be asked. One being guesstimate, second is profitability, third is market entry, fourth is merger & acquisition, and fifth is decision making. All consultancy firm do not ask from every variety, Auctus also includes the decision tree type of questions which is where they try to focus. And, apart from this when you start reading from these books, you need to practice cases because it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not about the knowledge that you have regarding the different kind of cases, it is about how you communicate this to the interviewer. For this you need to practice a lot and for practicing you should make case groups with people who are trying to appear for consultancy jobs. So I made a case group of 4 students, all final years who were very enthusiastic for consultancy jobs and used to practice for 3\u00e2\u20ac\u201c4 hours a day for about 3\u00e2\u20ac\u201c4 weeks. After those 3\u00e2\u20ac\u201c4 weeks, all of us got a good essence of how an interviewer would drive a consultancy case and how to tackle that. Once you have that in mind then you need to practice as much cases as you can. So this is the standard process, first is get a book & start reading it, second is when you get an essence, make a case group and start practicing as much as you can until you are able to crack all the cases, and thirdly cover all the variety and all the kind of possible scenarios that an interviewer can ask. Thanks Mayank for this and we will now focus on the frequently asked questions which you face that students find most difficult. And specifically in the context of HR round, like some FAQs from consulting firms having HR rounds. Like I guess more or less each & every one has so some of the frequently asked questions in HR round. So, I particularly remember the HR round of Auctus Advisors. That HR round was taken by the Managing Director of Auctus Advisors. He was sitting in the Philippines and I was in my room and it was taken on video conferencing. Now you can understand the scenario, you are sitting in front of him, you are doing a video conference. You don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have the time to think a lot. You need to respond quickly. So they take advantage of this fact that you have 2\u00e2\u20ac\u201c3 seconds to think & whatever first thing you will speak, they will consider it as an honest reply. Hence you should not change your answers. So in HR round they basically try to put you in a diplomatic situation in which you need to take a side. For example, what if your boss says something and you know he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s wrong. So in that part whether you will counter your boss or do whatever he is saying, so what will you do in that case. So in that case I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not saying that there is a standard reply to this. You can reply whatever you think is right keeping in mind that way in which you work in your surroundings. But just make sure that whatever side you are taking should lead to finally benefit of the company, not an individual. So for HR round I would like to say that just be honest, be clear with each & every word written in your CV because they try to point out the work \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcStatistics\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 & what you have done. One more thing I would like to focus that is that students in their CV try to throw a lot of unnatural statistics and work that they have not done, that the company had been doing, for example if you go for in intern in a consultancy firm there are several projects. So in that projects what students do is that they list down all the problems. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not possible for you to take part in each & every project and each & every question in just 2 months. Again I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not saying don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t write that, if you are writing that in your CV then be clear about what you have done and what was the responsibility of the company for completing that project. Okay cool. So what are the things that a student sitting for placement next year, more or less they will start preparing from July onwards after their final year intern, can do now from December to maximise their chance for getting through a company in this sector. So their placement preparation part more or less like when they return in campus what shall they prepare? In general I would like to answer this in 2 parts. In general if you are preparing for placements so basically getting yourself placed is a 2 step process \u00e2\u20ac\u201d one is clearing the test & being in the top percentile in which the company shortlists you, second is making it through the interviews. So in test most of the companies ask puzzles & all the content of categories \u00e2\u20ac\u201d English, Logical Reasoning & Quantitative Aptitude. These three things are a must that you should start doing from now, and apart from that you should have a bit of technical inclination as well. For that I would suggest start coding as well. The best resources for that is www.geeksforgeeks.com . So open that site, make your account and solve each & every question. So if you start doing from now a question a day, by the time you will land in your placement semester, you will have a very good idea of what companies ask in their technical rounds. If I focus only on consultancy firms to prepare for this then I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll say start early. Have buffer time with you so that you can revise all the concepts and go through as many cases as you can. Basically from now you can start reading a book and discussing the kind of cases & projects that are currently going on in different companies so that you can get an idea that in which direction a company is heading. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m sure that if you start exploring the different types of projects that companies are nowadays taking, so you will get to know that a lot of consultancy firms are including the aspect of technology also. So if you have an idea of how the technology works nowadays, you can not just crack the cases but also suggest some very unique ideas to the company so that they can move ahead in future. For example, one question that was asked to me in APM interview was What if Flipkart launches a version of Amazon Echo as a product in India. So whether it is a good idea or not. So you should understand that what an Amazon Echo does, what is it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s price & what price should it be launched by Flipkart, all the aspects. So this covering all the aspects takes time and a person can expertise on this by only reading different stuffs, blogs, that are available nowadays that cover different scenarios and interact as much as you can with your seniors, with your batchmates to work your way. Okay cool. So which part of your placement preparation did you find most effective & rewarding and if so , why? So the part most effective for me was self study. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fine if you study in a group, try to understand the different fundas & taking the help of your friends. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fine but I will say that it is very necessary for you to sit alone with a book, with a laptop and understand your weakness & strengths because it is you who will finally sit in the interviews and alone. There will be no one to guide you. Apart from this also what I have seen that has happened with a lot of students is that they have a lot of knowledge in their head, they know a lot of coding very well, they have a good knowledge of financial firms as well and for whatever profiles they are preparing for. But they don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t communicate it correctly with the interviewer, so you should understand that placement is a relative process. If you are bad but the best among all, then you will get selected. But if you are good & worst among all, you will get selected. So you need to make yourself better than others, relatively, for getting yourself placed. So I will say that sit alone, start analyzing yourself, that was the most effective part of my placement process. So was there any technical round once you were shortlisted, if so then how did you prepare for it? For consultancy firm there is no technical round. For profiles like product manager, there is a technical round. Technical round doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t mean that you should know coding, first of all. For whatevery company you are going to prepare for, understand that what is the expectation of the company from the candidate. If you are preparing for Product Manager, the questions will be like what is the storage space of G-mail, if we look worldwide. So you will start at an individual level about what is the basic space G-mail usually takes on a laptop then looking at the fact that how many G-mail users are there. So it is a technical round but they try to understand your inclination clubbed with you analytical solving skills. So did you have a checklist for preparing for your core discipline? If yes, then please elaborate. I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t focus a lot on my core to prepare, honestly. However if you are really interested in your core I would say to study well for the GATE exam that takes place at the end of your semester & try to score as much as possible & you will have the knowledge whatever the core disciplines demand from you. However I would suggest that focus on the company that you are trying to target and do the homework of trying to find all the expectations that are there from you. So more or less I think you have provided a great insight for preparing for consulting in campus. So anything else you would want to share with the students? So I would like to share that yes maybe your final aim is different, you are trying to go for higher studies or preparing for UPSC or different examinations but keep this one thing in mind that this one stage will come in your life \u00e2\u20ac\u201d you will be in your final year and all your friends will be sitting for placements. So if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re not going to sit in placements then make your mind a bit early and start focusing on the bigger picture in your mind that if you are going for UPSC then make your mind in the 3rd year only however if you are unsure about the fact that whether you will sit in placements or not I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll suggest that make your mind 100% for the fact that you are going to sit for placements and trying to get a job. For the same start as early as possible because a lot of things go around like you have CAT, you have semester B.Tech projects, M.Tech projects. Apart from that you have to go for classes, appear for tests, prepare for interviews and finally there is a lot of physical exhaustion as well. So it will help you a lot even if you start in your 3rd year like the preparation of all these things, it will help you a lot. So a last question, how did your KGP life & your 4\u00e2\u20ac\u201c5 year stay at IIT Kharagpur help you in fetching your dream job or more or less your dream profile? So when I entered into IIT Kharagpur I was completely unaware of what I wanted to do. I was unsure of whether I wanted to go for my core field or not. It took me 2 years, once I entered my 2nd year I realised that my core Mining is not the one which I would like to pursue in the long run. So from there I started exploring the different avenues that IIT KGP provides. So yes the best thing in IIT Kharagpur is that everything is self-driving. You need not to really brainstorm a lot on what you need to do and what you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t because you get a lot of vacations in summers and December in which you can intern in different profiles and find out which fields you are interested or not. So KGP life for me helped a lot like in terms of confidence, communication & logical reasoning. All these 3 aspects were greatly boosted because of all what I had done in KGP life & I would urge all the students as well to utilize your time here well, do good things, valuable things, and every little thing is going to help you.

Interviewed By: So my first question to you is, what is the general interview process for the company you applied to intern for? Hello everyone. So the specific role was for McKinsey Knowledge Center at Supply Chain Center of Competence. My interview process is divided into 3 rounds, in which includes 2 were technical and 1 was Case + HR round. So Rohan my next question is what was the nature of questions and what were the different types of questions that were asked in the HR round? On the technical side as my profile and internship profile both were on the supply chain side. It was very technical on the operations research and supply chain management related theory and how my previous internships and practical implementations have been. That was about the technical round, and there was simple case based round and the HR questions were also normal level questions. Thanks, Rohan for letting us know. Also could you tell us, what are the questions that are frequently asked in each round which are mostly difficult for many students, specifically in HR round ? I believe the major questions which were asked were related to scheduling, routing and inventory management because these are the major topics on which the project or internships depends and mostly all the interns who were with me were to be working on. So I think these are basic things that are included in each round of technical and HR round. Okay Rohan thanks for this, lets move to the next question. How did you prepare for your interview ,did you follow any resources. Also could you list the courses that would benefit the students of this field? In general, my profile relates a lot to supply chain as my previous internships and publications and all my projects here at Kharagpur are related to supply chain and optimisation, also about from where students should prepare there is a course called \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Logistics and Supply Chain Management\u00e2\u20ac\u009d in Industrial Department whose resources are very helpful for any supply chain logistics related interviews or courses or competitions anything. Thanks for your valuable information Rohan and the next question is , How to prepare for the internships during our stay at campus and how did you get prepared while you were at it.Also what are your suggestions for the students who are preparing for technical and HR rounds at present and how did you prepared yourself for technical and HR rounds? So,for me it was that I had only applied to the companies which are related to supply chain and here also at McKinsey &Company I came to know that there is a team called \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Supply Chain Center\u00e2\u20ac\u009d. So I applied to them through \u00e2\u20ac\u0153LinkedIn\u00e2\u20ac\u009d. For a general preparation in supply chain you need a very specific knowledge in the field of Operations Research, Data Sciences and the general supply chain management courses like the one I mentioned before. When it comes to case interview, you have to prepare in the general way of the consultancy case interview but from different books which are provided for different companies.I recommend to all those students who are preparing for technical and HR rounds at present is, to do some courses like \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Supply Chain Management\u00e2\u20ac\u009d and follow the books which are recommended in this course. Generally I do not prefer reading books rather, I would prefer doing online courses regarding this field because I believe this would be more helpful than that. hanks Rohan for all your tips.The next question is, What would you like to say for the 1st years who plans to intern in McKinsey company? Actually this particular zone at the Knowledge Centres is far different from the Consultancies one which comes to our campus for hiring. Generally these knowledge Centres mostly hires only from IIT Bombay, IIT Madras and few other Business schools and they mostly do not prefer hiring students from other colleges.But sometimes, when they need more interns they release their HJD\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s in January I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not sure that if one should rely on this opportunity by skipping the CDC internship,because these are not sure to hire you.For a general supply chain management role, as I told you that if you have a very good knowledge and interest in this field then you should keep pushing yourself towards this and have projects and publications and everything related to this field. Generally,in India the majority of this field is occupied by the students who have done their MBA and all. So people generally don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t prefer having engineering students in supply chain management roles.But,yes I believe there are certain opportunities if you work very hard and develop a specific interest in this field.This is something I would give as a suggestion because it is not a generalise field in which everyone can try, so you have to have a very specific interest. Cool,I think you have provided a great insight for 1st yr. students,Thanks Rohan. And my next question is, How to prepare for core discipline and describe the choice between core and non-core? On speaking about this particular field in which I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m working on, is the supply chain management which is specifically the core of industrial engineering- which is my course and my masters is also in the same field. So this field for me is core but for someone else it would me non-core.Even if it is core or non-core it really doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t matter as long as you have a particular interest in any of them.So, I would only say that go for the one in which your interested because at the end of the game it totally depends on one\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s particular INTEREST. Okay cool , and then the next question is , What advices would you like to give for 2nd years, who are currently thinking about which area to pursue like Coding,Consulting,Data Sciences\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6etc? First of all ,if they have an interest in any of them then should try exploring it further.For my part,when I was in my 2nd yr. I took 2 projects and also done a course on finance. I was also involved in AGV and I was also working on autonomous robotics. I also did 2 projects on data sciences.I also did 1 month internship in core mechanical engineering.This is how I explored and choose what to do and what not to do. The same thing goes to you also explore a lot of things, then you yourself can know what path to choose based on your interest. So a last question, Is there any effect of KGP life on your achievement? Obviously, there is a lot of effect of KGP life on my achievement.If I compare myself in 1st year and 2nd year there was a lot of change in me not just in my technical capabilities but also in my character and my urge or my ability to manage\/handle the things. My major priority was being involved in SPATS and NSS. I have learnt about a lot of organisations ,time management skills. Apart from all of these, I was part of technical team of AZAD hall.Actually if you take part in any happenings which takes place in campus you will come to know about many things ,which may or may not come in use at present but they surely come in use in your future. As societies helps us to explore ourselves through different things,for example: I have to build UI for my project consideration in my internship, If I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve thought back then in my 1st and 2nd years that everybody are doing machine learning and data sciences why am I doing web development where it is not useful though, by now I wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t able to tell myself that I can do my work well.

Hello Pradipti, sure you may. So, my first question is, what were the companies that you interviewed for? There are a few off-campus companies that come for Consulting every year i.e, Parthenon EY, Boston Consulting Group (BCG), McKinsey and LEK Consulting (however, didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t come the last year.) As far as on-campus placements are concerned, Auctus Advisors is the only company that comes for consulting. I was shortlisted for two companies, BCG and Parthenon EY. What was nature of the interview process that you went through for both the companies? The interview process for both the companies ie, BCG and Parthenon EY was almost the same. Firstly, there was a CV Shortlist round, where most companies look for a CGPA of around 8 or above, except for McKinsey which looks for a CGPA of 8.5 or above, I myself had a CG of 8.33 and therefore, I wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t shortlisted for McKinsey. Next, is a series of 3\u00e2\u20ac\u201c4 telephonic interviews that you have to attend, followed by another round of shortlisting when you will be called to either Mumbai or Kolkata by the company for further rounds of interview. There another 4 interviews take place and after that, the results come out. Could you please tell me about the kind of questions that were asked in the interview in various rounds? And how to prepare for these interviews? All of these interviews were case interviews, where you basically had to solve a case. I think most people are aware of case interviews which need proper case preparation i.e, forming a group of four people, where one has to act as an interviewer and the others will act as interviewees and you need to practice cases. This is a very standard procedure that everyone has to follow. To prepare for Case interviews, there are two sets of books, and there are other seniors like myself, who can help and guide you; it is essential that you keep practising between different groups because the number of cases for practise are limited. There is also a Consult Case Prep FaceBook group which interested students can join to prepare better. There is also a drive link that has been shared on the group, which contains all the materials for the preparation of various number of cases. Also, it is important to start forming case groups in the summer itself and start the preparation with them right after coming to the campus, as there is only one or around one-and-a-half month before the companies start arriving at the campus, so there is not enough time for preparation. What are the FAQs in most companies that you faced and think that students should definitely prepare for? Especially for HR rounds Other questions apart from Case Questions are HR questions and your CV only. They can ask you questions about your CV, like the PORs you have, or the projects\/interns you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve mentioned. So, you should be able to answer them. HR questions are mostly the standard questions, and nothing very different for Consult. What are the things students sitting for placements next year can do from now to December to maximize their chances of getting through a company in this sector? Usually, for Consult, the placements do not go on till December. They are done by the month of September-October. And so, preparation should be started early, preferably in the summers itself, and case groups should be formed. Also, make sure your CV and cover-letter are strong and get them reviewed by various seniors to keep them updated. How did your preparation for technical rounds evolve once you were shortlisted? Matter-of-fact, there were no technical rounds, there were surely some calculative type cases but, there is nothing technical that comes in a consulting interview. So, there is no technical preparation required. Anything else that you would like to tell\/share with the students? In general, all of us people at the consulting companies, we were planning to form a group to help out people interested in consulting, so, if you could make a database of people, we could do so, and help out people directly.

Yeah, Sure Pradipti. What were the companies that you were interviewed for? I did not sit for the conventional placement season in December, rather I sat for all the Consult companies that have their procedures in the month of August. The process starts from July end and goes on until the first week of August. Three companies come to campus for Consult in July-Aug, Parthenon EY, McKinsey and BCG (Boston Consulting Group). L.E.K Consult also looks to come, but nowadays, it takes people for interns and provides them with PPOs, rather than coming for placements; it did not come for the placement season this year. However, in the month of Oct-Nov, you have Dalberg, which is a social consultancy firm coming to the campus. What was the interview process of these companies? What was the nature of the interview process and the different interview rounds? I was placed in Parthenon EY, and the interview process of Parthenon was as follows- Initially, they do a CV shortlisting, where they have their portal, and we need to submit our CV there. On the basis of that, they shortlist around 20\u00e2\u20ac\u201c23 people. They basically look for academic excellence in your CV, a good internship, a good PoR and extracurricular activities as well ( They can be in the form of different competitions, or you are very active on social ventures or involved with an NGO etc.). Also, something like research papers or conferences becomes a plus point. After the CV ShortListing round, we were assigned buddies, who carried out an improvement session and helped us in understanding how the further rounds would be. So after the buddy session, you have interview rounds, which are telephonic or skype interviews, after which 7\u00e2\u20ac\u201c8 people out of the 20\u00e2\u20ac\u201c23 people will be shortlisted, who are called to the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s office and then there are interviews taken by the Senior Consultant, VPs (Vice-President) and Partners of the company. As in my case, there were four interview rounds, the first and the second ones were with a Senior Consultant, the third was with a VP and the fourth one was with a Partner. Following which, I got my placement offer. Could you please list down the questions that you were asked in different rounds? For the first three interview rounds, they made me do a case, and after we were done with the case, they discussed my CV. Also, if a person has some expertise in a field that you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve worked in too, he might ask questions about it as well, but then mostly there are general questions. However for the partner round, it was more of an interaction, they asked me questions about my CV, and also questions like Why I wanted to join the company? And what were my long-term goals? Where do I see myself in five years? are some common questions. Questions like What were your major databases? What was the scalability of the project? Can it be implemented on a larger scale or not? were some of the questions that were asked me, based on the projects that I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d done and they might vary from person to person, hence it is important for you to be prepared to answer them. Apart from questions from the CV, they also ask some basic questions like Why this company? Or why this particular profile? Why this role? Why do you want to get into consulting at all? What do you know about Consulting? so that is something you should be prepared with. Basically, they just want to know how good you are a fit in that particular company. How were the HR and the technical rounds? There were no separate HR or Technical rounds. But however, if you have worked on some project involving AI\/ML or anything technical, the interviewer can also ask those kinds of questions, so you need to be ready to face such questions. However, you can also have Math intensive cases sometimes. What is your advice to the students sitting for placements this year? Very limited number of firms come for Consult placements to KGP. Out of the 1300 people, only 2\u00e2\u20ac\u201c3 people are hired per company, so there is very intense competition. And because the first round is CV shortlisting, so, people who are highly inclined towards taking up such a profile should focus on making their CV\/ R\u00c3\u00a9sum\u00c3\u00a9 really well. Generally, the CDC template we have and the Consulting Profile CV are a little different. And therefore, you need to make two different CVs for this. It is important for them to talk to a lot of seniors, and contact them, to get their CV verified and checked. Additionally, they can also contact seniors to ask them for their preparation. They should be able to present whatever they have done till now in an excellent way so that they get shortlisted. Also, they should do some preliminary research on the company because when they go for the further rounds of the interview, that will help them. Forming a good case group, and practising a lot of cases, and building good business acumen and focussing on your soft skills is really important. The way you solve a case, the way you keep other people informed, and how you go about solving the entire case-solving process is really important. Since Consulting is a client-based profile, you will have to be good at all of these. Is there any preparation material for practising a good number of cases? The general material that most people follow is to watch Victor Cheng\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s videos for case framework on YouTube and I would suggest they also watch Victor Cheng\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s LOMS (look over my shoulder) which are basically recorded cases, where he is interviewing a candidate and he also gives some insights. CIC Case Interview Crack which is a Case Prep book of IIT Bombay and Day 1.0 which is the Case Prep book of IIT Madras are the two most essential and basic books required for preparation of cases. Apart from these, there are case books of IIM A and IIT K, which can also be used for preparation of cases. And you are also required to practice guesstimates. The best way to practice guesstimates is to catch hold of your friends and just engage them in a conversation that involves preparing guesstimates. In working out guesstimates, your approach is the one that is more important than the final answer. Anything else that you would like to share with the students? Be confident about whatever you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve done till now, and try to present that in a good way, these two things are really important. Also, practice a good number of cases, be thorough with the framework and develop your business acumen. One thing that people should avoid is to mug-up the cases or the framework, rather they should try to have their own way of solving a case. That is very important, and that comes only with practice, the more number of cases you solve, the better you get at it.

Today we are interviewing Miss Gauri Pathak who was recently placed at Auctus Advisors. So, let\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s begin the interview! Yes, sure! How did you decide that you wanted to go into consulting? I had a lot of 4-year course friends who were already preparing for different profiles be it data science, coding, or finance. So I got a broad idea of different domains. I have been participating in various case challenges and competitions since my second year. That is how I was able to narrow it down to consulting. Did you have any previous internship in this sector? No, not in consulting, but I had some good internships in my core, architecture, that provided me with really diverse work experience and projects that could be justified and talked about in the interviews. What was the nature of the interview process you went through for the companies? The interview process for most companies is the same, there is a shortlisting on the basis of CV and cover letter in August or September, then there are 3\u00e2\u20ac\u201c4 telephonic round interviews, after which companies like BCG, EY Parthenon and McKinsey schedule their interviews at their offices in Mumbai or Kolkata. Auctus Advisors had a few telephonic rounds after the CV shortlisting and conducted the final interview on the first day of placements. Last year Auctus Advisors was one of the few consulting companies that came to our campus for placements. What were the questions you were asked in various rounds and how did you prepare for it? These interviews are mostly based on case interviews, where you are expected to solve a case guided by the interviewer, so it becomes very necessary to practice a lot of cases. Since most of the companies begin the selection process from August or September, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s highly beneficial to make case groups in the summer and start practising with them soon after reaching the campus because there is hardly a month or two left for selections. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s good to have a set of motivating people around, who are also interested in the same field. I practised a lot of cases and guesstimates with my case group. There are a lot of resources available to practice cases. You can get started with Victor Cheng\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s video lectures series and use different case preparation books by IIT Madras, IIT Bombay and several IIMs to get access to cases for case interview preparation. What are the things students sitting for placements next year can do from now to December to maximize their chances of getting through a company in this sector? Are there some things that give one an edge or increase the chances of shortlisting? Consulting placements are usually not like other placements, most of it is finished till October or November. Therefore, it is very important to start preparing from the summers itself like preparing a case group, usually of four. The initial shortlisting is completely based on CV and cover letter, so making a proper CV and getting it rectified by as many good seniors is important. For the initial shortlisting, CGPA plays an essential role. Apart from case preparation, I think PORs, foreign internships, and projects also have an impact on the shortlisting. What are the FAQs that you think candidates must definitely prepare for, especially in the context of HR round? Some common questions which they ask are- Tell us about yourself? \u00e2\u20ac\u0153What\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s your story\u00e2\u20ac\u009d or \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Walk us through your CV\u00e2\u20ac\u009d, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153What is your motivation to enter the field of consulting?\u00e2\u20ac\u009d and questions related to things that are not in your CV, different internship related experiences, and PORs. HR round is something which people generally don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t prepare very well for, and think we can easily answer these basic questions about us and our CV, but they are an equally important part of the interviews as well. Any advice for the second-year students who are confused about which line to pursue- data, finance, etc? I think trying things out is the only way, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s better to take part in different competitions, taking up projects so that you can really identify what you would like to pursue.

Today we are interviewing Miss Runjhun Bharti Goswami who was recently placed in Auctus Advisors. So, let\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s begin the interview.So Runjhun, how did you decide that you wanted to go into consulting? Runjhun: It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s well known that consulting is a good platform to start, because, the learning curve is very steep and you are exposed to a lot of different fields be it finance, government sector jobs, etc. I wanted to start with something like that, that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s why I chose consulting. Interviewer: Did you have any previous internship in this sector? Runjhun: No, I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have any previous intern in this field. It all depends on how you tell the story. I mean in every interview they ask a question like \u00e2\u20ac\u0153 tell me about yourself\u00e2\u20ac\u009d or \u00e2\u20ac\u0153what\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s your story?\u00e2\u20ac\u009d In that, you are supposed to tell about your major internships and projects and in that only, I included this question stating about my last internship when I was in architecture field but the part I liked the most was about meeting with the consultants, as it was a huge project, and I and liked the brainstorming part, resolves and conflicts. Interviewer: What was the general interview process for the companies you interviewed, also please mention the number of rounds, and nature of the interview process? Runjhun: The major four companies that come to our campus are BCG, Mckinsey, EY Parthenon, and L.E.K. They all ask CVs and shortlist in the month of September, and by October everything is wrapped-up. I was shortlisted for BCG, which shortlists around 30 people, who all have a good CV. Then they start further rounds, usually, at least 4 rounds, and can have more depending on what kind of evaluation they want to proceed with. For Auctus Advisors, they shortlisted in October, then they assigned us a buddy, who is usually a person in the second year of the job. They evaluate us on the basis of different categories of cases we have to prepare for. There are mostly two kinds of cases qualitative and quantitative. Quantitative cases are usually covered in the first round of interviews which are usually taken by the buddies. There were three rounds with my buddy, one round with a Manager and one with the Director. Then they shortlisted around 10 people and these people were again interviewed by the Director on the day-1 of placements. Interviewer: What were the questions that were asked in various rounds? What were the FAQs that you think students sitting for placements this year must definitely prepare for? Runjhun: The first thing is, there are two books Day 1 and CIC (case interviews cracked) all of the cases from those books are important. The questions depend on the kind of projects the interviewers have worked on. One of the interviewers worked a lot with airlines, so he gave me a case about a new route proposed between two cities. There were several questions from my CV, on the projects that I had done. So it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s necessary that candidates know about the kind of projects the companies are working on. Also, they must be very thorough with their CV. Interviewer: What were the questions asked in the HR round? Runjhun: The HR round becomes much easy if you have revised your CV well. They ask you questions like \u00e2\u20ac\u0153what is your story?\u00e2\u20ac\u009d, your story should come out naturally and must be very grounded and wrapped up within two minutes. I covered my internships and PORs, meanwhile creating a background that though I was pursuing architecture, I was always interested in economics and entrepreneurship. I elaborated on my last intern a little bit, about the work I did and how it drove me into consulting. Interviewer: What are the things that students sitting for placements can do this time to maximize their chances of selection? Is there anything that gives an edge like CG or PORs? Runjhun: CG is very important and PORs do play a role. What people can do is take up good projects, which they can justify and start preparing. They all must start with quant preparation, guesstimates, cases, and puzzles. These are asked frequently and they must be well prepared for that. Also probability, statistics and regression \u00e2\u20ac\u201d there are a lot of questions from these in the tests that companies take. I would also suggest forming a case group (usually 4 members). Make a good CV and get it rectified by seniors. Interviewer: Any suggestions for second-year students who are confused about which area to pursue? Runjhun: I would suggest taking some PORs, and take up some good projects and courses and not sit idle.

BINDU: I believe that why consulting is the first question one should ask before delving into the preparations. The answer is subjective to people but I would like to walk you through my decision-making process. Throughout my KGP journey, I decided to explore various sectors through my internships and engagements, I had done research internships, and corporate internships in the core and non-core sectors. Also in the institute front, I was involved in several managerial positions. After exploring all those sectors I realized that one thing which I really enjoyed was client interactions and problem-solving. Besides that, I participated in several case studies which brought clarity in my mind regarding career choices. So, consulting became a natural choice for me. INTERVIEWER: While deciding were there some pros and cons that you considered? BINDU: Well, that is definitely one important thing to consider. Let me first talk about the pros! I think the one thing which is really important when you choose a career is that it should match the work you really want to pursue. The match with your skill set is also something you need to consider. Secondly, I think the client interaction, the exposure and diversity of problems that comes with the job are a plus point. Now if I talk about the cons, I think one con that is specific to our campus is the number of firms that come for consulting. Last year, 5 firms came to the campus namely Auctus Advisors, BCG, Dalberg, E.Y Parthenon, and Mckinsey. The limited number of firms visiting the campus is a definite con. Apart from that, the consulting firms\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 placement process starts before the conventional placement procedure(Dec 1 onwards) which makes everything a bit hectic. So if you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get through consulting firms for some reason, then you will face a time crunch to prepare for the December interviews because of the hectic interview process that consulting involves. INTERVIEWER: So by what time should a person decide like this is the final decision that this is the profile that I am aiming for? BINDU: The first thing that I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d like to highlight here is that we should not be very particular about a specific career option. Everyone should strategically come up with a plan B in case things don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t add up well. The \u00e2\u20ac\u0153if not this, then what?\u00e2\u20ac\u009d question should be answered quite early so that there is an ample amount of time for preparation. Since it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s May right now and placements are in December, students should focus on utilizing this time to come up with a proper preparation strategy after boiling down to two particular sectors they want to focus on. It will give them a choice if things don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t work out well. INTERVIEWER: What was the general interview process for the companies you aimed for? BINDU: I only sat for the consulting interview process, so I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll just walk you through the consulting interview process \u00e2\u20ac\u201d chronologically in the way I gave the interview. BCG: Initial CV and CL shortlist Buddy Cases Telephonic Case Interviews(2\u00e2\u20ac\u201c3 in number) Final round of interviews at location (3\u00e2\u20ac\u201c4 interviews in total) EY-Parthenon: CV\/CL shortlist 2. On campus buddy interaction(1 Case interview) 3. 3\u00e2\u20ac\u201c4 telephonic\/VC case interviews 4. Final round of interviews at location(3 in total) McKinsey: CV\/CL shortlist Buddy interaction\/cases VC case interviews (4 in total) Dalberg: In Dalberg, the process was a bit different. We had a CV shortlist followed by a 10 minute video call round which consisted of a few fit questions and 2 quantitative questions. The key was to be articulate in explanation and make them understand your motivation behind joining social consulting. Post that the shortlist was reduced significantly and there were 4 subsequent rounds comprising 2 cases each. So 8 cases in total. The cases are social cases and students must make sure they prepare social consulting cases before interviews. One thing to consider is to start your preparation early as the firms came quite early (process started by August) this year. INTERVIEWER: In those rounds what type of questions were asked? BINDU: The FAQs are generally common for every consulting interview round. One thing to remember is not to stick to the framework rigidly. In real case interviews, all of the questions are asked from real life cases that interviewers are solving in their particular domain. So, in order to solve those cases, you should always go by first principles of consulting. You should not be very rigid with using frameworks, that rarely works. And you should be holistic in nature while you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re solving the questions. That is one of the tips for every consulting firm. Second is that fit questions should be taken seriously for sure because when you are answering them, a lot of insight about yourself and the knowledge\/interest you have for the firm is revealed. So you should really take it into consideration,and in case of consulting firms you should try to keep your HR questions structured because consulting is all about structured problem solving. So when you are answering the HR questions, it should be structured in nature. You should not be answering \u00e2\u20ac\u02dctell me about yourself\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 or some other question all over the place. Apart from that we generally prepare for the questions that will be asked to us but we really don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t focus on the questions that we might need to ask the company. So that is really important, like in the end every company interview ended by \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcif you have any questions to ask?\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. So at that time if you ask any generic question, then it creates a bad impression as it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the last part of the interview and it stays with the interviewer. So you should really try to make that particular question memorable for the interviewer and it should not be a generic question but it should provide insight into your keenness towards the firm. INTERVIEWER: Can you tell us about what resources you used for preparation? Books or additionals or some online resources BINDU: For consulting I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t take any additional subjects. But I used books like Case in Point and Case Interview Secrets that I read during my summer internship only and that cleared the theory and answered what actually consulting is, and also the Victor Cheng videos are a good starter. Victor Cheng videos for case interviews and the book Case Interview Secrets are mostly the same and you can choose any one of them, but the book is more extensive in nature. After that I came back to the campus and started my case preparation by forming a group of people who are really interested and with whom I shared a good bonding. Bonding is very important as the other person in your team should be very honest with you while giving feedback. Hence, you should choose your group wisely- the people you are comfortable with and who are very excited about the process as well. We used standard books like the Day 1.0 and Case Interviews Cracked. After that we shared buddy cases and company interview cases among each other which really helped us. So that is the generic process for consulting. As I mentioned before, we should always have an option B so I also prepared for generic placements. INTERVIEWER: After being shortlisted for successive rounds, did you refer to some new material or change your preparation strategy in between rounds? BINDU: I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have much time as the 1st interview was followed by the 2nd and 3rd & 4th were on the next day for Dalberg. For BCG & EY Parthenon it was entirely on the same day. Hence, I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think you should change your strategy or prepare new material as it will not be efficient. Although in between preparing for the companies like Dalberg, I prepared for social sector cases and I looked into what sectors BCG, EY Parthenon and McKinsey worked and tried to prepare or have some knowledge about those sectors. So company specific preparation was there in between interviewing for companies. And obviously we should continue our preparation throughout the process and not halt it once the initial interviews start because it starts really early so it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not that if one of the rounds of companies is over then you stop your preparation. It doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t work like that. Moreover, one should always look back and learn from the mistakes made in previous cases. INTERVIEWER: What is the advice that you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d like to give to students preparing for consultancy considering the present world scenario BINDU: The one important advice which I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d like to give is that right now we have a lot of time in hand as we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re all mostly staying at home or on campus with no classes as of now and also the academic load due to online classes is relatively low. So I think we should utilise this time to properly and structurally prepare for the interviews. So one might be interested in consulting but obviously s\/he will be looking for other options as well. Like in my case I had consulting firms, core firms and generic firms. So we should structure our preparation according to our targeted profiles. If I talk about core companies then that is dependent on the particular department \u00e2\u20ac\u201d everyone will have their own way of preparation. For generic preparation I would suggest doing puzzles \u00e2\u20ac\u201d many people don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t do puzzles until they are back to campus and that creates a lot of unnecessary chaos. So start doing puzzles, it is very interesting and very helpful as well because most of the companies ask for puzzles and coding questions. For puzzles there are a lot of resources. Quantitative: 1.

Consulting as a Summer Associate and also got a PPO from the L.E.K. Consulting. Communiqu\u00c3\u00a9 IIT Kharagpur interacted with her on the interview process and the strategy she adopted for its preparation. Here, we present you a glimpse of the brief interaction we had with her. We thank her for spending her valuable time with us for the same. So, Sreelatha, What was the general interview process for the companies you interviewed? Please mention the number of rounds and the nature of the interview process. Well, I did not sit for many companies during my internship process. Amongst the few were L.E.K. The general interview process for companies is CV submission, then GD, and then PI. Since this is a management consulting company, we had preliminary screening by CV shortlisting after which we had a workshop followed by rounds of buddy sessions and case interviews. We participated in about 3 buddy sessions per person and 2\u00e2\u20ac\u201c3 rounds of interviews each. The workshop conducted for two days was very useful where the seniors explained the interview process, what case interviews entail, preparation practices, etc. In the interview process, we had case questions, guesstimates, and HR rounds. Could you please list down questions were you asked in the different rounds? Puzzles, technical questions, any other discussion in general that you think will prove to be helpful for students. Typical questions of case interviews can be divided into three parts: one is guesstimates which are estimation questions on various topics, the second is a typical case interview and the third is a personal interview. An estimation question is solved using analytical skills and superficial assumptions. The aim of the interviewer is to check your analytical skills and finding out numerically an estimate of a particular number related to a category. For example, they could ask you something as simple as to estimate the number of smartphones in India. One can the following simple process to go about it: what is the population of India, then segregating the population based on say rural-urban localities, gender, age, income groups, internet penetration in different areas and in general phone penetration and usage penetration. So, the idea is you have to understand which factors play in your calculations at what stage and the goal is to arrive at the number of smartphones. The above is an example and there can be varied questions here: the number of petrol pumps in a region, the number of leaves in a forest, etc. Number two is the case interview. There are two types of case interviews that people typically ask at an undergraduate level: one is a simple profitability case, so in a profitability case, for example, say a company XYZ is facing a decline in profit in the past two to three years, so your problem statement is to identify why. The interview is a very interactive discussion where you ask your interviewer questions and they provide you requisite details to help outline and narrow down your hypothesis to arrive at an answer. The interviewee is advised to follow a structured flowchart and ask the relevant questions at different stages and try to outline what factor\/s is causing this decline in profits. Usually, case questions are followed by suggestions as to how we can overcome the given problem. These are extremely dependent on the candidate itself and a good analysis with further segmentation can get you brownie points! The second type of question is a market entry case. Say a company XYZ wants to enter the retail industry or a company operating in XYZ country wants to enter the market of another country. The interviewee analyses different aspects including the barriers of entry, mode of entry, profitability, risks, etc. and presents a solution. Again, this is a very interactive interview where at each step you ask the interviewer the right questions and streamline your hypothesis. What are some of the FAQs in most companies that you faced and think students must definitely prepare for? More specifically, in the context of HR rounds. In the PI section for L.E.K. Consulting, the aim of the questions is to get to know the interviewee better. Topics of discussion include past work explanation, extracurricular activities, motivations, achievements, etc; Since consulting firms hire from all departments, a few aspects for the students to note: Understand each and every aspect of your previous experiences \u00e2\u20ac\u201d you should be able to explain it in the most granular way possible \u00e2\u20ac\u201d details, impact, etc. So, CV preparation is very important. Besides this, questions include career goals, expectations from this internship, motivation to be a consultant, knowledge about consulting, why do you think you are a good fit for this industry, and so on. What are things students sitting for placements next year can do from now until December to maximize their chances of getting through a company in this sector? So the first and foremost thing I can say is that you have to start preparing from as early as possible because case preparation can take about one to two months. There are a few steps you can follow. The first thing is to start preparing your CV as off-campus placements start very early on the campus and before your summer vacation gets over you should be ready with your first draft. Proceed to get it checked by as many seniors as possible, preferably in the industry, department, seniors who know you to optimize it so that you can present it in the best possible way. The announcement of the interview process happens only 10\u00e2\u20ac\u201c15 days before the schedule. So you have to start preparing as early as you can. Material for preparation is easily available \u00e2\u20ac\u201d Drive folders with relevant books and useful websites. Any senior who has undergone the process can easily point you to them. One starter useful resource is Victor Cheng\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s videos. They give a brief overview before you can take up case interview books. Preparation is better done in groups of 3 to 4 people. Join efforts with your friends, preferably with diverse opinions. A diligent schedule of mock cases and guesstimates can help you keep track easily. As I have mentioned before, case interviews are very interactive. The interviewer and the interviewee have an active discussion with each other so when you prepare for interviews it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s best to replicate this process with your friends.One person can be an interviewer, second can be an interviewee and the third person in the case group can be a passive audience who can note down and tell you what points you can improve upon. I would also suggest people record your interviews and iterate on improvements in presentation, vocabulary, etc. So in this way you can conduct mock interviews amongst yourselves and improve your performance! Focus on improving your analytical skills and speed in maintaining multiple trains of thought. More practice can help familiarise you with a variety of questions and boost your confidence in the interview process. How did your preparation for technical rounds evolve once you were shortlisted? Since there are no technical rounds in consulting, one useful tip is to reach out as many seniors in the industry and schedule mock interviews and guidance sessions with them. Anything else that you would like to share with the students? It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s very good to see many juniors interested in the field of consulting. An internship at such a firm is a very valuable experience. So start preparing early and join in efforts with friends. Reach out to people if you have any questions and ask for feedback and develop your skills. Feel free to reach out to me or any other senior who can help you. All the best! Thank you Sreelatha for giving your precious time for this interview to Communiqu\u00c3\u00a9 IIT Kharagpur. I hope your interview will help students in their future endeavors. Thank You Back to list","category":"Internship","profile":"Consulting","department":"Biotechnology"},{"blog_id":11,"blog_text":"Chandar Siddharth Intern at LEK Consulting Interviewed By: Mr Chandar Siddarth from IIT Kharagpur has previously done an internship in L.E.K. Consulting as a Summer Associate and also got a PPO from L.E.K. Consulting. Communiqu\u00c3\u00a9 IIT Kharagpur interacted with him on the interview process and the strategy he adopted for its preparation. Here, we present you a glimpse of the brief interaction we had with him. We thank him for spending his valuable time with us for the same. So, Siddarth, What was the general interview process for the companies you interviewed? Please mention the number of rounds and the nature of the interview process. So, during my CDC internship process specifically for Consulting, I had only interviewed with L.E.K. and it is the only firm that comes to the campus for CDC internship. I interviewed with only this and I got selected for the internship. There were two rounds specifically. In order to qualify for these two rounds, you have to upload your CV on the portal. The first basis of shortlisting is CV shortlisting so they look for the points in your CV in the first stage. After shortlisting, about 20 to 40 people are selected depending on the quality of the CV\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s. Then these selected people go for the first round. The first round is usually a guesstimate round, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a common consulting interview process where you are asked to estimate something. For example, the number of cars in India or it can be estimating the number of taxis in a city like Mumbai or it can be the number of ping pong balls you can fit in a room and so on. So, there is a set process as to how you arrive at your answer and that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a guesstimate round for about 15 to 20 minutes. It is largely problem-based, there are not many HR questions in the first round. The second round was a case interview. A case interview is something which is a very common round in consulting-based interviews. This round involves business problems that your interviewer asks you and you discuss with your interviewer to potentially arrive at a solution at the end of the interview. A lot of things matter in a case interview, your analytical skills and your communication skills are the most important in my opinion. Those were the two rounds specifically that I had to be the part of in order to get selected for the internship. Could you please list down questions that were asked in the different rounds? Puzzles, technical questions, any other discussion in general that you think will prove to be helpful for students. Interviewing for a consulting firm is not like interviewing for any technical firm. There are quite a lot of differences. Firstly, you will not be asked simple questions which you can answer in two-three lines. Like in technical rounds you might be asked how to write the shortest code for a particular sort of problem or how to solve a particular linked list problem, what is the best algorithm to do so etc. Something like this is asked, multiple questions having short answers. But this doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t happen in consulting interviews. What ends up happening is that the entire interview consists of one problem. The conversation may last up to 40 or 45 minutes. For example, they can ask you that a random shoe company like Nike or Adidas has seen losses in a particular quarter of the year let\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s say particularly in Asia. They will ask you to find out why and what you can do to improve revenue for the next quarter. Now, this is how broad the problem statement will be. So, it is like doing a case study live one on one with your interviewer. So what you will be doing is you will be looking for different areas where there could be potential problems as to why the revenue was falling, why the company was facing losses and then you will finally zeroing one or more causes for the problem and you would use your creativity and common knowledge to find out potential solutions that you can implement to get rid of these problems over the course of time in the next quarter. This entire process will take a lot of time because there are a lot of things to consider when it comes to finding out what is actually causing the problem that your client has. There is a systematic way to proceed from like top to bottom. We usually call it ME-CE(Mutually Exclusive Collectively Exhaustive) which means you are looking at different aspects of the cause and these aspects are exclusive from each other like you are not looking at the same thing over and over again. Together all of these things, these multiple parts are exhaustive. The idea is to go down to the depths of each potential cause and find out where the problem is. So, the problem statement can largely vary from interviewer to interviewer. It really depends on the interviewer as to what they have prepared to ask. It takes nearly 20 to 45 minutes, sometimes even up to an hour. What are some of the FAQs in most companies that you faced and think students must definitely prepare for? More specifically, in the context of HR rounds. So especially for consulting, HR is not a separate round usually unless it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s very close between you and somebody and there might be an extra HR round or something like that. The usual purpose of HR in a technical company or software development profile is to find out how good you are in communicating and how good you will fit into a team. This is what is evaluated in the HR round. But since the nature of the consulting interviews itself involves a lot of communication, this is sort of integrated into the process itself. So, a consulting interview, mainly, a case interview will have a lot of emphasis on analysing and evaluating your communication skills as well as part of the interviewer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s job. So, the interviewer is looking at how good you are at communicating as well. So that is something, that is evaluated as the part of the case interview itself and that is precisely why there isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t a need for an extra HR round. However, in your case interview round, they might have a conversation with you before or after the case for let\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s say like 10 or 15 minutes just to get to know what kind of a person you are. This is usually considered to be the HR component of a consulting interview. This is not very long, usually kept very brief and it involves things like what is your motivation behind applying to consulting or why do you want to get into consulting or why specifically X or Y or Z firm, why do you want to apply to our firm and general questions like what are your strengths, what are your weaknesses, show us an example of a leadership quality that you demonstrated in the time in college and also the questions pertaining to your CV that you submitted before, so they might ask you questions from you CV. For example, if you did an internship at an ABC company, then they might ask you to explain any problem or crisis that you solved during your internship at ABC company. So, the HR part of the consulting interview itself is very brief and maximum lasts for about 15 minutes and as I said most of the questions of these questions are standard ones and the subjective ones could be the ones from your CV. What are things students sitting for placements next year can do from now until December to maximize their chances of getting through a company in this sector? In the present kind of scenario (considering COVID-19 pandemic), there is a lot of uncertainty in the market, in general, in the job industry specifically. Consulting is not a sector this is a personal informed opinion. Consulting is not a sector that should be massively affected because it employees highly trained professionals and have a limited number of employees. It basically functions on the number of employees it has and it is not a mass recruiting firm like it does not recruit thousands of employees in a particular country like how a technical firm would need. So, it should not be an industry that is affected massively, however, what will be affected is the timeline of the interviews and timeline of the recruitment process this particular year. Usually the process for consulting interviews, specifically for placements happens much before December. It happens around the month of July, August and September. It can move a little forward or backwards so it can start from August and go on to September, October or it can be July, August and September. This is the usual case but this year I think it will be further extended by quite a bit. It might start as late as October or November and might coincide with the actual placement process that happens in December. So, the major companies that come for consult placements are Boston Consulting Group, McKinsey and Company, EY Parthenon Group and specifically L.E.K. Consulting Group in the context of IIT Kharagpur. These companies currently because of COVID-19, they may not be able to carry out their recruitment process like they usually do. The consult timeline would be pushed back quite a bit. So, what students can do right now since they have a lot of free time, they can prepare for case interviews. This is something they can do because of extended summer vacations as well. What they can do is they can prepare for case interviews really well right from the get-go. So usually, students end up coming back to campus and forming their case groups and start preparing for the case interviews. You need somebody else to prepare with, you can not prepare by yourself because one person places the interviewer and the other person place the interviewee and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s mutual so if I and X person form a case group, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be the interviewer for one case and they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be the interviewer for one case, so we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll do it alternatively so that both of us can practise. In the present situation, because of social distancing, we can not do it in person, however, we have access to skype and other platforms, we can do it online and we have a lot of time right now. As the consult timeline is going to get postponed you will have more time to prepare well so that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a good thing. Practice is a sure short way to clear the case interview. The more practise you have, the more likely you will do well in the interview process itself. How did your preparation for technical rounds evolve once you were shortlisted? In my particular case, it was the internship season so I was not sitting for placements. My year was the first year, L.E.K. Consulting decided to come for internships. There was no concept of pre-final year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s preparing for consulting before. So usually the final years have formed the case groups and were preparing for consulting interviews simply because consulting interviews only happened for placements, not for internships. However, in my year L.E.K. decided to come for CDC internships. I was not very sure about my shortlist itself. So, once I had known that I had got shortlisted based on my CV, I had formed a case group. It was pretty late, but I had formed a case group then and I prepared pretty rigorously for about 2 weeks doing cases with that person before the interviews started. So, in those two weeks, my preparation was solely focused on gearing myself up to do really well in case interviews and guesstimates. I practised many case interviews and guesstimates with my partner from multiple sources. As I said in my answer to the previous question right now there are about like 5 to 6 months before you get to have your interview, so if you are really looking towards consulting and you think your CV has a good chance of getting shortlisted then you should definitely start preparing now. Anything else that you would want to share with the students? So consulting is not for everybody. It might look like a very interesting or very happening field but it comes with pros and cons. Make sure you research about what consulting is and whether it is something that would suit the kind of a person you are because you may not end up liking it after you get into it so this is the thing I really want to tell students. At least if somebody wants to explore consulting they should try doing an internship in consulting before getting placed in consulting directly because once you get placed it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s your job, you can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t change it at least for a year and if you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t like it, then you won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be happy and this is not something you will look forward to. So, what I would say is talk to seniors who already worked in consulting and find out whether it will suit you or not, another way as I said, go for an internship first to see if it suits you or not. All consulting firms irrespective of whether it is for internships or placements, the first step is CV shortlisting, so make sure your CV is made really well. The chances of getting shortlisted are directly proportional to how your CV is. Once you get shortlisted, start preparing well for the interview. Thank you Siddarth for giving your precious time for this interview to Communiqu\u00c3\u00a9 IIT Kharagpur. I hope your interview will help students in their future endeavours. Thank You Back to list","category":"Internship","profile":"Consulting","department":"Mathematics and Computing"},{"blog_id":12,"blog_text":"Anusha Saran Placed at BCG Interviewed By: Hello everyone, today we have Ms Anusha Sharan, who has recently got selected in the Boston Consulting Group. Anusha, can you mention the general process of interviewing at the companies that you have interviewed for? Hello everyone. So I interviewed for two companies, EY-Parthenon and the Boston Consulting Group. We received an email around the last week of July from both the companies, asking the students who were interested in applying for the Associate position to send their applications. Around one week later the shortlists of both the companies were received. BCG shortlisted around 33 students and while EY- Parthenon shortlisted 17 students. At EY- Parthenon, we had a buddy session and two rounds of case interviews before the final interview happened. The date of the final interview of EY- Parthenon clashed with that of the BCG final interview. I had to choose between one of the two firms and I decided to interview at BCG. Can you provide some deep insights into the interviews rounds you faced for Boston Consulting Group? Once the students were shortlisted, there was an interactive session with Kharagpur Alumni currently working in BCG which was held in the campus itself. It was said to be non-evaluative and we just had a general discussion about things like \u00e2\u20ac\u201d What is it like working in BCG? How is the working environment? What are the perks? After this session, there were buddy sessions that were organized for the shortlisted students wherein KGP alumni working at BCG practised cases with them and gave them feedback and tips to improve their case-solving abilities. Following the buddy session, we had two interview rounds between 12th and 14th August, and both were conducted by Senior Associates at BCG. Both the interviews started with me giving a short introduction of myself, after which I was asked to solve a case. Some students had more than two interviews. This batch of interviews was wrapped up within one week and 11 students were selected for the final interview which happened on 19th August in Kolkata. The final batch of interviews consisted of two rounds of interviews with people who held senior positions at BCG. After those two rounds, I progressed to the Partner round which was the final interview for the day. So the number of rounds for me was three but it varied between 3 to 5 for others. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a good insight into the general interview process. Moving on, can you mention the number and the type of questions that they asked in different rounds? In my first interview, I was asked to estimate the number of roller coasters in India and my second interview was a timed case where I had to solve the case within a specified time frame. In my case, it was 15 minutes and it was broken down into 12 minutes for the actual case and 3 minutes for the synthesis and the provision of recommendations. It was a fairly simple Profitability case but the real challenge was to work through it quickly and not lose track of time. The first interview on the final day had a general discussion on my resume followed by two cases. The first case was a Market Entry case related to the energy sector which had a lot of data points. The second one was related to my resume and I was asked to describe how I would go about creating a perfect pianist. I had mentioned in my resume that I had been playing the piano for the past 12 years, so based on that and on the basis of the discussion that we had before the case interview he gave me a relevant case. So I suggest people be comprehensive with their CV and be prepared with possible related cases. The second interview on the final day had a Market Entry case where I was asked to figure out if shifting all operations to China would be feasible for a company based in America that sold different types of plastic goods. This was a relatively tricky case because the interviewer did not provide any data points. I therefore had to ask a lot of questions at every step of the interview to figure out how I would go about solving the case and arriving at the solution. Both the interviews lasted for 30 minutes and the end of every interview I was asked if I had any questions for the interviewer. The final round that had happened with the Partner lasted around 15\u00e2\u20ac\u201c20 minutes. We discussed my resume for about 10 minutes and it was more of a free-flowing conversation rather than him asking me one question after another. After this discussion, he gave me a case where I was asked to provide insights and justifications for some business decisions that were related to the scenario that the Partner provided. He asked me questions like \u00e2\u20ac\u201d Why am I making this business decision? How am I going to convince the client that my choice is correct even though he may not like to hear that his company is failing? At the end of this interview as well, I was given an opportunity to ask the Partner questions. I hope students do prepare up for such questions. Moving on, was there any change in the timeline for 2019 as compared to that of 2018? I would like to add that the timelines of 2019 are very different from 2018. The recruitment process in 2018 was very well spaced out. Hence, the final interviews basically wrapped up in October but then in 2019 the final interviews happened in August itself. I would suggest students be prepared for a scenario similar to 2019, but to expect the timelines to be unpredictable this year. After you had qualified for technical rounds, what changes you saw in your preparation? There are no technical rounds as such in BCG, so I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m just going to explain the preparation for the case interviews. So ideally you should start preparing beforehand. You should not wait for the shortlists, if you think you have a chance of getting shortlisted. You could prepare guesstimates even if you think you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have a chance of getting shortlisted in a consulting firm because you never know, you might just get shortlisted because the criteria for selection differs among firms. Also, guesstimates are useful for multiple profiles and not only consulting. I started preparing with my case group a couple of days after I reached the campus and we solved a couple of cases per day with some gaps between the days. The cases were a mix of guesstimates and profitability cases; we increased the number of cases to a total of 4 once we got shortlisted. So one week into getting shortlisted, we had a fair idea of Profitability cases and once we had the sense of the basic framework we moved on to the Market Entry cases and unconventional cases. Anything you would like to mention that you think if you had done, it might have proved more beneficial for you? Revision of cases. Due to the shortage of time I couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t properly revise all the cases I had practiced. I cannot stress enough on the importance of going through the cases you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve solved, understanding where you had gone wrong, finding key takeaways from the case and trying out an alternative structure you could have used to solve the case. I would say the number of cases isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t as important as solving your cases thoroughly and extracting the most from the cases you have already solved is. What preparation material did you use for your preparation? The resources that I had used were Case Interviews Cracked by IIT Bombay, Case Interview Secrets and LOMS by Victor Cheng, and Day 1.0 by IIT Madras. When do you think is the optimum time for the student to start preparing for the consulting firms? I would suggest the students interested in consulting to start thinking about their consult prep from mid-June onwards. Do not underestimate the importance of a good resume, and build your resume from scratch. You should be ready with your resumes and (ideally) your cover letters too, by the second last week of July. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m going by previous year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s timelines since I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not sure how the coronavirus crisis is going to affect the schedules for this year, and the recruitment timelines are bound to be unpredictable. During mid-July, go through the set of 12 video lectures by Victor Cheng, which is available on YT. These are very short and will take you a couple of days to finish at the most. You will get a basic idea of what a case is, and what to expect in a case interview. You can also go through the Profitability and Market Entry frameworks in Day 1.0 and CIC, but don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t read any case except for the solved examples because then the cases will be wasted. You can do all of this on your own and you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t need a case group for this. Start solving cases with your case group only when you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re done with all this and don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t blindly dive into solving cases without having any background knowledge. Form case groups by mid-July and start working on solving cases from the third week of July since you probably won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get much time to prepare if the timelines are similar to last year. You could start with guesstimates since they don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t require the knowledge of frameworks and you could quickly solve them over a telephonic conversation, in case the campus reopens late. Coming to the final question, suppose a student from second year is looking forward to getting placement in the consulting firm, what suggestion might you give to him? It would be best if you start thinking of consulting as a career option during your CDC internship and not before that. Instead of thinking about consulting this early, trying to follow what people who got selected did and \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcbuilding your profile\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 accordingly, you should explore all kinds of opportunities IIT Kharagpur provides you. You would get invaluable experience from this and once you find out where your interest lies, pursue it aggressively and you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll see that it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s going to reflect on your resume automatically. Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t worry about checking all the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcright\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 boxes so much, just do all the things you like while trying to balance your academics. Maintaining a CGPA of at least 8 is extremely important, despite consulting firms claiming to not have any CGPA criteria. Thank you for your time Anusha. Thank You Back to list","category":"Placement","profile":"Consulting","department":null},{"blog_id":13,"blog_text":"Indresh Kryalos Placed at BCG Interviewed By: Today we have Mr. Indresh Kryalos with us who has recently interviewed for the Boston consulting group. So Indresh, can you tell us about the general interview process of the company that you have interviewed for? Hello everyone. Most consulting companies arrive off-campus so it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not a much-standardised process. But it primarily involves three rounds, the first is shortlisting of CV. Second is a phone interview or a preliminary interview of sort listed candidates. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s done over call or skype consisting of two to three interviews with different people. Final shortlisted candidates are interviewed over video call or are asked to flyover to Bombay office for a partner round, a partner is the senior member of the firm. Is there any CG criteria that these companies follow during CV shortlisting? If you have a CG below 8 it becomes difficult to get shortlisted in the companies I interviewed. However, there are a lot of consultancy firms coming on campus like Auctus Advisors, A D associates and there consultant role is similar to product manager role up to some extent. For each of the company you can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t say that the CG matrix are the judges, however, there is definitely a function of POR and Projects. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a good insight for beginners. Moving on, can you mention the questions you felt were similar and students must prepare for them? For the case interviews round, you are given a problem statement, you and the interviewer have to work through it together so you end up asking questions and gathering more relevant information out of interviewer and the interviewer job is to guide you to the final answer without being very simple about it. This is a major part of your preparation for the consultant job role. Apart from that you have HR round in which the questions will be from your CV so be well versed with your CV. General questions are, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Tell us something about yourself\u00e2\u20ac\u009d, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Why consultancy and not something else\u00e2\u20ac\u009d, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Why this company\u00e2\u20ac\u009d along with some case question from your CV. I hope students do look into the questions mentioned. You have mentioned about case groups. Why do you think a student preparing for Consultancy must form this case groups? Case groups are quite important in initial part of your preparation, the thing with case preparation is that if you read a case you waste it because you haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t put any thought behind it, you haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t put any work in getting to the answer. You don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have a reliable person who is also preparing, who will ask you the case who will guide you through the case but in the team of four people usually, one person read the case and does it with another person and now two people who know the case they do it with the remaining two so now it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more optimised. In a case group of four people you end up wasting 25% cases. So four people is a good number for a case group. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a good insight for case group. Moving on, where there any puzzle or technical questions asked during the interview? No, there are no technical questions for testing your problem-solving capability. However, let\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s say if you have a prior internship in finance and your interviewer is also well versed in finance he may ask you questions that may be relevant to your internship or you should know for internship in finance. There are no technical questions as such for which you have to prepare. The case is more and the HR part is important. Moving on, after qualifying for the case round, what were the changes in preparation changes you made for HR round? The process essentially shifted from preparatory interview with your case group to mock interview with other people, you may not be as comfortable with like other case groups, recent graduates or even KGP alumni who are in senior position in those firms. It puts you in sort of stress environment and that is a big part of cracking the consultancy interview. Relax no matter who the interviewer is and you will be able to solve the case much better and be able to answer HR question as well. What preparation should the students who are looking forward to getting placement in consulting firms start from now? Now is not really the time to worry about case interviews or consultancy interviews in general. Right now the best things students can do is make a CV for this consultancy interview and apart from that I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think now is a good time to begin preparation. Being in lockdown the dynamics of internship are slightly changed, so you should still look to explore more about other sectors say finance, data analytics and coding whatever fancies you have. Two-three months are enough time for preparation in consulting firms. Once you usually return to the campus, you should start preparing. If you start preparing before I feel you may end up losing momentum or run out of cases. So this is not advised with my experience. If they want to do something, start making your CV. I hope student do follow up with your advice. So, what resources did you followed during the preparation? There is Day 1.0 by IIT madras campus and case interview crack book by IIT Bombay. These are two primary resources that most people are using. There are lot of case questions if you get out and search but lot of those case questions are for IIMs interview so people who are interviewing from IIM, it is more relevant to them. Apart from these, there are actually not very resources available. There are few PDFs out there with guesstimate questions that you will get. For case interviews sake these two are the only books I practice with. What suggestion you might give to a second-year student looking forward to placement in consulting firms? The answer to this question for me is in two parts, so the first is as a second year you have a lot of opportunity on campus. To be fairly good at consulting interview, it requires just a window of two months or so. If you are a second-year you should not direct yourself to go to a consultancy firm. There are ample of opportunities for an IITian and you should explore those. And if you do not like any other field at the end of the day I think then you should look into consultancy because consultancy field in general offers you a lot of exposure to different fields so it is a gateway field essentially whereas a consultant I may be working on fishery or a social cause. If it doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get narrow down over your 2nd, 3rd or 4th year then you should perceive that consultancy is a good option. Secondly, I did not do anything that was specifically oriented towards consulting. I just did what I enjoy. I explored my department for 2 years, did projects that are relevant to my department, internship and I was involved in dramatics as well as sports. So that worked out for me by giving me a holistic serious epiphany which has a lot of distinctive points. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a unique field. Now as I fifth year I have secured a job and when I look back into things I have done in my 2nd, 3rd, 4th year, I would not be able to do it with career orientation in mind. It did help me somewhere down the line. I would just say that explore what all opportunities IIT KGP have to give to you and do what you like. Thank you for your time Indresh. I hope the KGP community has got to learn a lot from you. Thank you Back to list","category":"Placement","profile":"Consulting","department":"Biotechnology"},{"blog_id":14,"blog_text":"Pallav Bhutani Placed at BCG Interviewed By: Hello everyone, today we have Pallav Bhutani who has been placed at Boston Consulting group. So my first question is, what was general interview process for the companies you interviewed for? Hello everyone, its great pleasure to be here. I had only interviewed for Boston Consulting Group during my placements. Most of the consulting firms including BCG generally follow a multi-tier selection process. Firstly, they might take an aptitude test followed by two-three or sometimes more than three case segments round. The interviewer provides you with a case at that time for which you have to consult to the client (Interviewer) the possible solutions . Finally. In HR round, the senior director generally asks your aspiration and judges you to be a good fit for company or not. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a good insight for the beginners. Moving on to specifically to HR round, can you tell us the nature of it? HR round is the last round before selection. So, its not as tricky as other technical rounds. There is a pdf by the name \u00e2\u20ac\u212260 HR Questions\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 over the internet. If one can go and hover over them, it won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be that difficult to answer the questions in the final round. A basic suggestion is, be true to yourself, explain your needs and wants to the interviewer and explain how they match with that of the company. I hope our audience won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be having any more doubts on HR round after this discussion. Moving on, what were the quizzes and technical question you faced during technical rounds and how do you think an aspirant can prepare for them? For consulting, there are case rounds in which the interviewer (posing as a client) provides you with a real-life situation: for example, what should the company be doing during corona pandemic? Most of times they focus on some specific businesses, at any scale: Example: Carlos at KGP is facing decline in sales, what are the three things Carlos should do to overcome the situation? The problems asked are generic but the candidate is judged on how many insights he\/she has brought up with limited information in a limited time of 20 mins. What courses or some books that you might suggest to other aspirants looking forward to placement in consulting companies? Preparation for case interviews generally starts one month before the interview. You have to form case groups of 3\u00e2\u20ac\u201c4 people. These are mostly practised and hence no books are there to tell you what to do. Case books of IIT Madras, IIT Bombay and case book by Victor Cheng had been followed by me for practice. 12 Videos of Victor Cheng are available on Youtube. They come in handy for starting the preparation. I hope students do take a lot of suggestion from this. Moving on, after qualifying technical round, what changes do you see in your preparation? Since there was not much time gap for me between both rounds, hence there were not many changes as such. However, during technical round, you are not supposed to tell of your aspiration, you are judged aptitude and mental ability. In HR round, you are judged on how you fit for the company. You can even learn the aspiration of the interviewer. Moving on. Suppose a second year is looking forward for getting placed in consulting firm, what suggestion you might give to him. To be frank, we did not have more than 14 days of preparation for the consulting firms and these were enough. Even if I got one month more, I would be solving these cases the same way I did during the 14 days. Because it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more about your thinking ability, not like coding that you need to know some algorithms for solving. If you see the Victor Chang videos, you will understand that the videos there are very generic, you will be able to go through the interview. If he\/she knows the logic and knows what the interviewer is asking, he might get selected as well. So, it nowhere necessary to start from 1st or 2nd year. Just 2\u00e2\u20ac\u201c3 weeks of preparation might do the work. Thanks Pallav. My final question, what changes has KGP bought in your life? KGP has bought a considerable change to my life and I say to everyone, the companies that this person is an IITian and will do the assigned task; however, they look whether the person is responsible or not. This is the portion where Kharagpur provides you with an edge. All the activities of Kharagpur, curricular or extracurricular, all the events build up the persona of the individual. Working in the fests or other organization activities provides you with know-how of how to deal with the person and this is what every company looks into while hiring. It might sound harsh but PORs are needed in the workflow. It was a great talk with you. Thank you for your time Pallav. Thank You.

Please mention the number of rounds and the nature of the interview process. The process is pretty similar for most consultancy firms, it starts with an initial CV shortlist, which is done on the basis of your CGPA (should be 8+ ideally), internships, projects, PORs on campus, extra-curricular activities, or basically anything that helps you stand out. After shortlists are out you generally start with a couple of telephonic rounds, and if shortlisted, you have final interviews with the partners or directors of the firm. That is the case for Auctus Advisors as well, there were two telephonic interviews with the allotted buddy, followed by an online VC interview with a manager and then a director, all in the month of November, mostly all of them being eliminating rounds. If you make the final shortlist, you have 1 or 2 final interviews on December 1st, Day 1 of CDC placements. Could you please list down questions you were asked in the different rounds? Puzzles, technical questions, any other discussion in general that you think will prove to be helpful for students. Consultancy firms usually focus only on case interviews. In a case interview, you are given a problem statement, for example, \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcA restaurant is facing declining profits \u00e2\u20ac\u201d figure out why and give suggestions\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, and you are supposed to work with the interviewer to reach the solution. I was asked to estimate the number of crows in Bangalore in my first buddy round, another interviewer asked me to make a growth strategy plan for a chemical-producing company, my final interview with the director was helping an airline company decide if they should start a direct flight from Kolkata to Goa. The cases are supposed to be interactive in nature, they generally judge you on your solution structure, clarity of thought, quality of suggestions and problem-solving skills. There are different categories of cases as well \u00e2\u20ac\u201d guesstimates, profitability, market entry and pricing are the most common. What are some of the FAQs in most companies that you faced and think students must definitely prepare for? More specifically, in the context of HR rounds. For HR, standard questions like \u00e2\u20ac\u201d \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcTell us about yourself\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcWhy consulting\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcwhy this particular firm\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcbest intern and why\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcCV walk-through\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, and any questions from what you have written in your CV are common. What are the things students sitting for placements next year can do from now until December to maximize their chances of getting through a company in this sector? They can start with making their CVs and writing their cover letters for the application processes. Make sure you get your CVs reviewed by many seniors and alums, that really helps. They can also start making case groups with reliable people, which are essential when preparing for case interviews. A case group should ideally have 3\u00e2\u20ac\u201c4 people. The timeline for this year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s process is very unclear as of now, so students can also start with their case prep after they are done with their CVs. For case prep, IIT Bombay\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CIC and IIT Madras\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Day 1.0 is the popular books, so practice those cases with your case group. Once they have the basics right, they can start contacting alums and buddies for practice cases as the number of cases in the books is limited. Also, practice cases with other case groups, so you get more comfortable with interviewing with different people, that also gives you access to more number of cases. How did your preparation for technical rounds evolve once you were shortlisted? There isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really any technical round in the recruitment processes of consultancy firms. Just focus on your case prep, and be very thorough with your CV. You should be familiar with the technical aspects of your internships or projects that you have mentioned in your CV. Some cases can be very math-intensive, and speedy and accurate calculations are important, so ensure you are comfortable with that. Anything else that you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d want to share with the students? So case prep isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t an individual task, ensure you have a good case group of 3\u00e2\u20ac\u201c4 people, also practice a lot of cases with alums and other case groups. Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t wait for shortlists to start preparing, even if you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t make the shortlists, there are a lot of firms that come during CDC placements which take case interviews or guesstimates. While doing cases, don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t memorize frameworks or stick to a rigid structure, you should be able to come up with a new structure or improvise as the case progresses, as per the requirement. With case prep, also try to squeeze in some little prep time for other profiles, like coding, quant, finance, etc., and be sure of what profiles you want to sit for in placements. For junior students, maintain a decent CG of preferably 8+, that is very important. All the best!

Thank you So without wasting much time let\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s start the interview Yeah sure So the first question is what was the general interview process for the companies that you interviewed mentioning the number of rounds and the nature of the interview process? I was interviewed for 3 consulting firms, BCG, EY Parthenon and Auctus Advisors. Generally the selection process for consulting firms starts early from August or September. The first step in the process is CV shortlisting followed by case interviews which can vary from Buddy calls, Manager\/Director level calls to the final Partner rounds. In BCG, 30 students were shortlisted for the case interview process followed by 2 to 3 Buddy rounds which are said to be non evaluative. 10 students out of the entire pool were called for the final interview rounds in Kolkata where another 3\u00e2\u20ac\u201c4 rounds were conducted with the Managers and the Partner before the final offers were rolled out. Similar was the case for the EY Parthenon, the initial shortlist was of 17 students followed by an on-campus Buddy round and 2 interviews with the Managers on VC. They finally called 7\u00e2\u20ac\u201c8 students for the final interviews in Mumbai where another 3 rounds were conducted with the Managers and the Partner. For Auctus Advisors, the process starts a little late, the CV submission is done from the CDC platform only and the shortlist is released by October. The process is again similar, starting with a buddy round followed by a Manager and a Director round on VC. 10 students were shortlisted for the final round on Day 1 of the placements and another 3\u00e2\u20ac\u201c4 rounds were conducted with the Directors before shortlisting the final candidates for the job role. Could you mention some questions which were asked to you in the different rounds like puzzle questions, technical questions? So for consulting the interview process is a bit different than conventional companies. In consulting, case interviews are given more importance as a part of the selection process. As any other interview, it starts with you introducing yourself to the interviewer followed by a couple of cases that need to be structurally solved and concluded with the help of the interviewer at each step followed by some HR questions depending on the interviewer. There are no separate HR rounds in the process as the nature of the interviews are such that communication skills and fit for the role becomes an eccentric part of the process itself. What were some of the common questions asked by every company? Some of the common questions that can be well prepared before the interviews include \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Tell me about yourself? \u00e2\u20ac\u0153 which is often an underrated question taken by the students. It is very important to keep this in mind that the initial introduction sets the tone of the interview, so a crisp and preferably structured answer prepared for the same helps in going a long way along with the case interview process. Other questions could be along the lines of Why Consulting? Why Firm? and other basic HR questions that can be prepared as well. What students must definitely prepare for before facing the interviewer? The students who are willing to apply for consulting job roles need to start preparing early from the summers itself. They can start with forming a case group with 3\u00e2\u20ac\u201c4 like minded students aiming for the similar profiles. Next step would be to draft their own CVs\/Cover Letters from scratch. A lot of thought process goes into reflecting yourself on a piece of paper, so it is very crucial to get your CV rectified by seniors and understand what is relevant and what is not. Though the timelines will be very unpredictable this time, the students can still make use of this time to get through some of the basic theories\/frameworks and guesstimates given in the resources like Victor Cheng videos, Day 1.0 and Case Interview Cracked and start practicing cases with their groups as soon as they reach campus. Any advice to the students who would be sitting for placement this year from now till December so that they can maximize their chance of getting placed in a consultancy firm? With respect to consulting, there are very few companies that visit the campus for placements and have limited openings. At the same time it is important to realize that the process for case preparation is not limited to select few companies like these but relevant to many other companies\/roles that require a similar skill set. Being said that, in terms of suggestions in preparation as per my experiences, it is equally important to periodically reflect back on previous cases and evolve your approach step by step. Recording your own cases and reviewing them back is a handy approach to improve case flows. For me personally, solving unconventional cases helped me a lot in improving my structure and could work out for you as well, if structuring is at all a problem. It is equally important to understand the role of a good interviewer while practicing cases within the group and make sure the feedback is as detailed as possible after each case. Though the process demands a lot of time, efforts and commitment, I can surely say that the experience is rewarding beyond results and the offer is just a cherry on the cake. How did you prepare for technical rounds like coding rounds or something in a similar manner? Well there are no such coding rounds if you are applying for a consulting role as we discussed earlier, there are only case interviews and the case preparation for the same can be done through various resources like Day 1.0 from IIT Madras, Case Interview Cracked from IIT Bombay and Case Interview Secrets and LMOS by Victor Cheng. The starting point can be the Victor Cheng videos followed by the basic theory\/frameworks given in Day 1.0 and CIC. There are a couple of solved cases also which the students can go through to understand how the flow for a case interview works. Rest of the cases need to be practiced with the group starting with Profitability cases followed by Market Entry and Unconventional cases. Within these sections also students can start with 1 star then 2 star cases and so on to develop a strong hold on the case solving mechanism. Doing guesstimates is another crucial thing which helps in broadening your thinking process. There could be many ways to solve a guesstimate, so students should try and brainstorm multiple methodologies to solve the same guesstimate and discuss it within their groups. Solving just a lot of cases should not be the priority, understanding the fundamentals and strengthening the first principles step by step are much more important. So, any higher knowledge of coding or finance is not required? No, nothing of that sort is required. All your previous experiences, be it in any field needs to be properly reflected on your CV which is the first step of the shortlisting process. Just in case the interviewer decides to grill you on your CV, you should be in a position to justify your work. After getting shortlisted, the majority of the focus is on your case solving skills in the interviews, rest everything becomes secondary. What were your participations and involvements during your stay at Kgp? Throughout my stay in the campus one of my singular focuses was to proactively try out various things which excites me to be a part of it. Moving ahead in this direction, I got various opportunities to explore in robotics, research, core and finance to find out the best fit for myself. The internships I did added more perspective to the kind of work culture that best suits me, the organizations I worked for nurtured my leadership and team working skills, the projects and the competitions helped me realize the importance of implementing my knowledge to something tangible. All these experiences contributed in some way or the other to help me figure out the right choice and consulting looked like a natural fit to go ahead. Any advice that you want to impart on students? My advice to all the final year students sitting for placements would be to first of all ask themselves what are the profiles they are really interested in. Once they have decided that this is the kind of profile that they want to go for, they should start reaching out to seniors who are working in these firms to understand whether it is a right fit for themselves or not and then start enquiring about the selection processes and the kind of preparation that is needed for the same. Placements is a long process and it provides a lot of options\/opportunities for the students to apply from. So it is very important to be aware as well as informed about the prospective role you want to end up with, as it comes with a commitment for at least a year or so.

Interviewed By: Hello Tanay, this is Abhishek from Communiqu\u00c3\u00a9, and I would like to ask you a few questions for Communiqu\u00c3\u00a9\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s initiative, CQ ConsulTalks. Hello Abhishek, sure go ahead. Can you give a general overview of the consulting firms that come for campus recruitment? There are tier 1 firms that come in the first half of that semester such as BCG, McKinsey, L.E.K. Consulting, EY Parthenon. Auctus Advisors and Dalberg come in the later half of the semester. Final rounds for Auctus happen on Day 1. L.E.K. Consulting might not come because they might be shifting to an internship \u00e2\u20ac\u201d PPO based model. There are some firms like EY, Deloitte, KPMG that come during the placements, which can be classified as tier 2 firms. Why did you choose consulting as a career option? What do you think are the pros and cons of consulting, and who should look at a career in consulting? I was a part of B Club in my first year, that is where I first heard about consulting. I realized the actual value addition of consulting when I was interning at Uber. My manager was an IIM-A graduate, and he had worked at a consulting firm for three years. The thought process and the structured problem solving approach that he had was fascinating. I had never been impressed so much with anyone in my life. He told me that consulting is something that gave him these skills and taught him how to break down problems and look at the solutions, and I was drawn towards consulting as a career option. I got an internship at LEK Consulting, and that experience helped me understand what consulting really is. I loved the experience at L.E.K. and I knew this is what I want to do. Pros: The learning is unparalleled as compared to any other industry. You will be working on multiple projects across different industries, and there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an exponential learning curve. Everyday during my internship, I was working on different problems. This isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t something any other industry would offer you. Consulting allows you to exit anywhere you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d like. What people usually do is that they stay in consulting for 2\u00e2\u20ac\u201c3 years, and then transition into VC, Private Equity, Corporate Strategy or even start their own companies. Cons: There will be a lot of pressure; you will be working at least 12 to 14 hours a day, and if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re looking for a 9\u00e2\u20ac\u201c5 job, consulting is not for you. As the consulting shortlisting process is extremely competitive, as a 1\u00e2\u20ac\u201c2rd year, how do you build your profile for consulting? So for the tier 1 firms around 500\u00e2\u20ac\u201c600 people apply, and nearly 30 people are shortlisted for the interview round just based on CV. So the main step is building your CV. There are four aspects of your CV: CGPA: It is very important to keep it above 8 to be considered for at least the top consulting firm. Some people have shortlisted at 7.8 or 7.9. But 8+ CG is a must. Internships: In the final placement process, I have realized that most of the people who were shortlisted were people who had Day 1 internships. That is something they look for. BCG particularly paid a lot of attention to day 1 internships. They look for good brands, but the impact you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been able to bring at any firm is important. Particularly for first- and second-year students, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s very important to explore things. For me, I interned at a start-up in my first year, which helped me a lot. It is not important to run after brands at least in the first and second year. So, build your internship part accordingly and try to land a Day 1 intern through CDC. Position of responsibility: Mostly all the Placecoms, GymK Gsecs, VP, Kshitij, SF with decent CGs were shortlisted. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s important to differentiate yourself among the competitive pool, and showing that you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve taken up these leadership positions is a great way. But don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t worry if you aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t a part of any of these. I did not have any of the flashy PoRs, I wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t even a governor of any society until my 5th year. Extra Curriculars: For me, the extra-curricular helped me in differentiating myself. I have been a part of Inter IIT cultural meet, tech meet, and an inter IIT sports probable. I was working on a start-up, \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcInfinityBox\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. So that start-up experience is also something that consulting firms really value and helps you differentiate yourself. Pick two or three things, and do amazingly well in those aspects. As a pre-final year student, what can students do to maximize their chances? As a pre-final student, most of your profile has been built. There is not a lot that you can do in terms of your Resume. There are some things you can focus on: Try and land that Day 1 intern: Talk to students who\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve interned there, start preparing 1\u00e2\u20ac\u201c2 months in advance. Start working on your communication skills: All the people that I know who got it into consulting have very good communication skills. I was the part of DebSoc that really helped me, and communiqu\u00c3\u00a9 is doing great work to help people to build those communication skills. Get your resume reviewed: Get your resume reviewed by seniors who are at consulting firms or who have just got in. Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t make your resume very technical, remember the person who\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s reading your resume will most likely not understand your industry. Focus on the impact you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve driven, and the results, and make sure the resume is written in layman terms. If someone has been shortlisted for the interview, how should they go about the interview process? Start prepping at least 1\u00e2\u20ac\u201c2 months in advance. Start with the case group. The case group are three or four people who have been shortlisted or who might be shortlisted whom you can case-prep with. Some very useful resources were Victor Cheng Videos on youtube, IITB Case Interviews Cracked, IITM Day1.0, and IIMA case book. Once you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve started preparing with your case group members, reach out to seniors who have got in the consulting firms, ask them to do mock interviews with them. McKinsey pays a lot of attention to HR questions as well. I was asked a few questions such as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Tell us about the time when you have faced a conflict\u00e2\u20ac\u009d, , \u00e2\u20ac\u0153What are you most proud of?\u00e2\u20ac\u009d , \u00e2\u20ac\u0153What have you done for your department?\u00e2\u20ac\u009d \u00e2\u20ac\u02dc \u00e2\u20ac\u0153You have a lot of extracurricular achievement, how has that shaped you in life?\u00e2\u20ac\u009d So if you have been shortlisted for McKinsey, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s very important to focus on these questions and build stories around your life so you can effectively answer these questions. My McKinsey buddy told me that nearly 40% of the decision will depend on this. Which part of your placement preparation did you find most effective & rewarding, and if so, why? Case prep with my case group members and my seniors was particularly helpful. I interned at L.E.K., and a few seniors at L.E.K. really helped me in strengthening my communication skills and helped me structure my thought process. I was also shortlisted for Parthenon before McKinsey, and through the interview process with Parthenon I was able to gain the confidence that I needed for my McKinsey rounds. How did your KGP life & your 4\u00e2\u20ac\u201c5 year stay at IIT Kharagpur help you in fetching your dream job or more or less your dream profile? I will give a lot of weightage to my DebSoc experience. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a lot of overlap between debating and case interviews, and the communication skills I built through DebSoc was helpful. A few of my DebSoc seniors were at consulting firms. So I could easily reach out to them and ask them about their interview experience as well. My intern experience at L.E.K. consulting was a short 2 month stay in the world of consulting, and the problem solving approach I built at L.E.K. came in handy for my McKinsey interviews. Anything else that you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d want to share with the students? Students in their first-second year are running after consulting, Data analytics, and big brands. In the first 1\u00e2\u20ac\u201c2 years, no big brand will give you any responsibility as an intern, because you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have any experience and they can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t take risks. The biggest piece of advice from my end would be to work at start-ups. Pick up a problem you really care about, and see which startups as solving it. Reach out to them, and stop running after brands. Consulting is a great way to start your career and if you are really keen, and you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get in through your undergrad, you can look at an MBA. Most of these consulting firms such as Mckinsey, BCG, Bain, L.E.K hire extensively from the top IIMs. So, if you are sure that you want to go-to consulting and you could not get in through your undergrad, then an MBA is the best way. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also important to reach out to seniors, to understand their experiences. If anyone wants to have a conversation, then they can reach out to me as well.

Interviewed By: Hello Utkarsh, this is Abhishek from Communiqu\u00c3\u00a9, and I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d like to ask you a few questions for Communiqu\u00c3\u00a9\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s initiative, CQ ConsulTalks. Hey Abhishek, sure. What was the general interview process for the companies you interviewed? Please mention the number of rounds, the nature of the interview process, and your experience. I can tell you a bit about Mckinsey. Wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t focus on the rest of the firms as other folks can answer about them better. Basically there are three rounds: A CV shortlist round, an Engagement Manager (EM) round, and a final Partner round. The number of applicants keeps getting funneled in all 3 rounds. In our case, 13 got through CV shortlist into the EM round and 4 went into the final Partner round. Notably, after the CV shortlist round, there is a period of around 2 weeks\/10 days where you are allotted buddies. These buddies are people at the firm \u00e2\u20ac\u201d associates or senior associates who have completed around 2 to 3 years in the firm. These guys help you out in the process. They talk about what kind of questions you can expect and how to prepare for them and what the partners are looking for in later rounds. For me, the buddy experience was really good. Both my buddies were super helpful. I think that Mckinsey is really good at this part because the buddies step out of their way to help you out. One of my buddies talked about very practical kinds of things, what to do and what not to do in an interview. He had also shared some of his case questions with me, which turned out to be very helpful. I also find it crucial to point out that the Buddy sessions are entirely non-evaluative at McKinsey and they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re an opportunity for you to know more about the firm. Now after the CV shortlisting and buddy rounds you move into actual interviews: EM round and if you make it through, then into the Partner round. Both EM and Partner rounds have 2 or 3 interviews. You\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll have a 3rd interview depending on whether the firm is able to build conviction about you from the first 2 interviews or not. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll explain both EM & Partner rounds: The Engagement Manager (EM) level folks are one level up from the associates. They have spent around 4\u00e2\u20ac\u201c5 years in the firm, and they have a very good understanding of how Mckinsey operates. I had 2 interviews. I suspect that Mckinsey has some protocol in which one interviewer is a KGP alum, and the other interviewer is from some other college. I think that they do it to build greater conviction on you from both an internal and an external perspective. My first interviewer was from KGP and had gone to IIM, and specialized in the Financial Services vertical. The other interviewer was from BITS and IIM. I remember that the first interview question was about Retail Lending, the client\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s loan book had increased but profits were down. The second interview question was about the stagnant revenues of a client\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hotel in an otherwise burgeoning Hotel Industry. I think I did fairly well on both of them. Then I moved to the Partner round with 3 more applicants. Partners have a minimum of 7\u00e2\u20ac\u201c8 years of experience at the firm, they lead case teams and bring in new clients. Partner rounds are more conversational. They just gauge whether you can have a lively chat for about 20\u00e2\u20ac\u201c25 minutes without getting them bored. Again, a similar type of mixture in the interviewers, my first interviewer was an IIT Delhi\/IIMA alumnus and the second was an IIT KGP\/IIMA alumnus. The first interviewer had been in consulting for the last 25 years and was extremely experienced. He was from IIT Delhi, then IIM Ahmedabad, and had been consulting for years more than my age. He first asked me about my prior internship experience. I had talked about ITC, where I spent my previous summers, and explained how I had generated buy-in for my proposals by co-creating a solution with the senior management. I remember that he said that this was something they generally do at McKinsey. The case question was around electric vehicles and clean energy that finally ended up in a free-flow discussion about an article that the Partner had written. He even emailed me the link to his article after the interview. After that, I had my final round with Aditya Sharma, a partner from IIT KGP\/IIMA. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s one of the youngest partners at McKinsey and a Forbes 30u30. My initial conversation was around what I have done on campus. We talked about Alumni Cell and he mentioned that he was on the Founding team of Alumni Cell years back. We also talked about IIT Tech Ambit, a publication I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve founded in KGP. After that, he asked about an instance where I had resolved a conflict and I gave an instance from my time as the Inter IIT Cultural Captain. My case was also around that. He asked me how I would prepare Indian players for the next Olympics tournament If I became Head Coach of the Indian Olympics Team. This was a seemingly unusual case but we worked through it together. Next, he asked me to guesstimate how many hotel beds in India which was very straight forward. That was it. Next, I was notified on phone by the HR that I was in. :) What are some of the FAQs in most companies that you faced and think students must definitely prepare for? More specifically, in the context of HR rounds. I think any McKinsey interview has two components, first is Behavioural-questions, and the second is case-based. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve heard that, unlike other firms, McKinsey gives an equal weightage to both parts of the interview. Behavioral questions are more or less HR questions. Questions like \u00e2\u20ac\u0153What was your greatest accomplishment in your internship ?\u00e2\u20ac\u009d, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153What did you learn the most?\u00e2\u20ac\u009d, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Have you worked in small teams of four or five peoples?\u00e2\u20ac\u009d, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153What are the major things that you learned from it?\u00e2\u20ac\u009d, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153An instance of leadership?\u00e2\u20ac\u009d, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153One instance where you resolved a conflict?\u00e2\u20ac\u009d, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Strengths, weaknesses?\u00e2\u20ac\u009d, etc. I am only talking about Mckinsey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s perspective and the kind of HR questions that I encountered in my interviews. It makes sense for them to identify these kinds of skills because they want to see them in a Business Analyst as you will be working in small teams mostly and would need to resolve conflicts at various stages. It went quite well for me. I had prepared well on the behavioral part and had thought through my experiences in four years of college. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s important to remember stories from your past experiences and structure them well when these questions are asked. For instance, when asked about the resolution of conflicts I had mentally prepared to talk about an instance from my time as the Inter IIT Contingent Captain. On the second part of the interview, which is case-based questions, I think Mckinsey is different from the rest of the firms because the rest of the firms have a lot of focus on conventional case solving, and they want you to be very good at that, but in Mckinsey, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s much more conversational, and you need to be very structured in your thoughts. They generally won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t even ask conventional case problems, especially in the Partner rounds. Key point is to go MECE all the way in everything that you say in your interview. There are a couple of books that people generally refer to like \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Day 1.0\u00e2\u20ac\u009d and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Case interviews cracked.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d These two books have a lot of Cases inside them, the majority are conventional cases but there are some great unconventional ones too. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s good to go through them and practice with a partner. I think it is more important to be structured & MECE in the way you are presenting, and you should able to have a good conversation with the person itself. What are the things students sitting for placements next year can do from now until December to maximize their chances of getting through a company in this sector? I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know with the COVID pandemic out there if placements will go as usual or not, so I can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t comment about the timeline that people should follow. But when it comes down to dedicated case prep, I think one month is enough for it because it keeps your thoughts fresh. You are in practice \u00e2\u20ac\u201d no need to begin the case prep 3\u00e2\u20ac\u201c4 months before the placement season. I think one month is sufficient for the prep for case interviews. How did your preparation for technical rounds evolve once you were shortlisted? I talked about a couple of books. Those books are good enough, and I think we should form a case group of 3\u00e2\u20ac\u201c4 people. I had a case group of 4 people, and we used to do cases between us. It was a great experience as my team members were awesome at solving cases and I have learned a lot from them. It makes sense to form groups where all members have good chemistry but bring different perspectives and styles on the table. As the consulting shortlisting process is extremely competitive, as a 1\u00e2\u20ac\u201c2rd year, how do you build your profile for consulting? That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a good question. The first thing you should keep in mind to get placed in good consulting firms is that your profile\/CV should have spikes. Your profile basically has four broad sections \u00e2\u20ac\u201d Academics, Internships, Leadership\/PORs, and Extra Curriculars. Mckinsey looks for spikes in your CV \u00e2\u20ac\u201d either you should have a huge spike in one section or have moderate spikes in most sections. Academic spikes could be a DR1\/2 and\/or papers published in top conferences. Moderate spikes may be an 8.5+ GPA. In internships, day 1 interns and FTs could help you well. To my belief, prior internships in either financial services\/good banks or in more operational kinds of roles at ITC\/HUL\/P&G can be great. Software internships may also count. For leadership\/PORs, I think working in a good Cell or probably being a GSec will add a big spike to your resume. McKinsey also gives a lot of weightage to entrepreneurial endeavors that you may have undertaken. In Extra-curriculars, If you have won a cup or medal in Inter IIT, or even Inter Halls, then it will add a spike to your profile. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s it. All the best! :) Feel free to drop me a mail at utksn15@gmail.com to discuss in more detail. Thank you Utkarsh for giving your valuable time, and I am sure that this interview will surely help people interested in Consult to prepare and learn better ! Thanks a lot! Thank You Back to list","category":"Placement","profile":"Consulting","department":"Mechanical Engineering"},{"blog_id":19,"blog_text":"Ishiqua Agarwal Placed at Flipkart Interviewed By: The first question that comes to the mind is what to prepare for? There are so many profiles and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not possible to prepare all of them. So how did you decide what profile to aim for? Ok so I was preparing for consulting roles, product roles, and core companies. My decision was based on a lot of factors, the most crucial being my interest. I discussed with my seniors, tried to know more about the profile, what they actually expect from you once you join, and also about the exit opportunities. It also depended on my previous internship experiences. After analyzing all these factors it was more clear which of the profiles actually aligned with my interests and with my future plans. It is really important to decide beforehand which profile to aim for because you have to then divide your preparation time accordingly. So for a good preparation and ample time to practice, by what year should the student finally decide about which profile to aim for? It totally depends on student to student. If you realize your passion soon then it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s well and good. Even if you realize your passion in your final year then even that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s okay. Alright. So my next question to you is what was the general interview process for the companies you aimed for? For Flipkart, I applied for the Associate Product Manager role. There was a problem statement released and we had to submit our slide deck containing solutions within a time frame of 10 to 12 days. Based on that slide deck they shortlisted 16 candidates. It was followed by the buddy round. My buddy was an alumnus working in Flipkart. She helped us to prepare well for the interviews. Buddy round could be evaluative or non-evaluative depending on the company. Then after 3 weeks or so there was the final interview at Kharagpur. There were more product case interviews. There were a total of 5 rounds. The 1st round was problem solving, followed by two product thinking rounds. The 4th round was the fit round and the final round was the technical round. Okay so in each round, what were the questions they asked and any FAQs which you prepared or which you suggest to prepare? Questions were mostly cases. My 1st round was a problem solving round which was basically a case round. There they expect one to identify and solve the problem. The questions could be, for example, the number of users of Uber cabs is decreasing, figure out why and suggest recommendations. Some candidates were also asked to do a guesstimate in the first round where they check how good you are with numbers. In guesstimates, they require you to estimate a number by taking proper assumptions and using logic. So one example could be to estimate the number of shampoo bottles sold in India in a day. The next two rounds were product thinking rounds where they checked the ability to think creatively. One of my questions was to plan the subscription model for Flipkart. The next round was the fit round, a sort of HR round. There were general questions like why this company? Why this profile? Mention an instant where you showed leadership skills. And I was also given a few diplomatic situations where the interviewer wanted to know what I would do in those situations. Then the final round was the technical round. Here, they do not expect you to know coding, but yes you should definitely have a sound technical understanding. For example, how does WhatsApp messaging work? How does GPS work? I was asked questions based on applications of Machine Learning too. Can you please elaborate a bit about selection procedure and questions asked during the HR round and the best strategy to prepare for them? In HR rounds the questions are very general. I would advise students to be themself, be genuine, and confident. For this, I would suggest them to recall their memory and jot down all their experiences which they think they can share. And it is highly advised to be thorough with your CV because questions will definitely arise from your CV \u00e2\u20ac\u201d Why this? And why not this? Why did you take this particular decision? For example \u00e2\u20ac\u201d After interning in core companies why did you switch to a different role? So by HR round, the interviewer wants to judge whether you are actually fit for the role, and are you actually interested? Okay so my next question is what advice would you give to the students who are going to sit for placements this year? Yeah so first of all final year students should decide the profile he or she is targetting. Time is limited and preparation has to be specific. Deciding the profile is of utmost importance. Because preparing for all the profiles is likely very impossible. After that, once they have decided they should prepare their placement preparation schedule accordingly and stick to it for the rest of their semester. Generally, companies conduct a preliminary test to shortlist the candidates. The test usually consists of quant, logical reasoning, and English. For technical roles, coding too. Then for interviews, puzzles are most important for all job profiles as maximum companies include it in their interviews. Alright, so what are the resources that one must refer to while preparing or rather which you used for your preparation? For solving puzzles there are a few must do\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s like Heard on The Street, Fifty Challenging Problems in Probability, and GeeksforGeeks. These are very good sources. And they must revise Probability and Statistics as it is really important. I would also advise juniors to do a bit of coding and now since because of the lockdown everyone has plenty of time they should start as soon as possible. This is for general preparation and specifically for the APM role the candidate needs to prepare guesstimates, problem solving cases, product thinking cases, technical, and HR. So, to prepare well for case interviews first you need to form a case group of 3 to 4 members and practice a good number of cases. The most important aspect of case solving is structuring. So for that, I started with Case Interviews Cracked(IIT Bombay book) to get a grip on structuring and then moved to product cases. The books which I referred to were Cracking The PM Interview, Decode and Conquer, and Preparing for Product Interviews. Also, the case practice should not be restricted within group members and they should try to do cases with other shortlisted candidates also because this is a way where you can exchange your ideas and once you are confident with your cases then they should do cases with alums too. You can find guesstimates in a lot of books such as guesstimate compendium, CIC, etc. For technical rounds they expect you to know the working of websites and apps in general. So start observing and reading more about apps\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 functioning. A product manager should be aware of new upcoming technologies, so start reading blogs too. So after you were shortlisted, did you alter your preparation like change the method of preparation\/refer to some new material? Frankly speaking, I started my product case prep only after I was shortlisted. Before getting shortlisted for Flipkart I was shortlisted for BCG and Parthenon so I did have an idea about case interviews. I had practiced consult cases. And after I was shortlisted I had to change my preparation. I did product cases more and prepared for the technical round after some time since I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have much technical knowledge. So I started following more technical blogs. I started using more apps, developed a basic understanding of web development, and about ML-DL applications in general. Alright. So now my last question to you is what advice would you give to students who are preparing keeping in view the present economic conditions due to CoViD-19? o I would suggest the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd year students explore as much as possible. This is a really good time to explore. There are a plethora of opportunities available in Kharagpur, make good use of it. Try to do courses, projects, grab internships, discuss with your seniors, and try to know which companies and profiles visit campus. It is necessary since most students aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t aware of what the placements and internships and CDC all together look like. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s only after exploring you will realize your passion, where does your interest lie? Also, I would suggest them to start coding because we have seen that maximum companies visit for tech roles during placements. Placements are very uncertain so you need to have a strong backup and it would not hurt to add one more skill. Coding is directly or indirectly required in all the fields, and it gives an upper hand too. It would definitely provide a very strong backup for placement. And to pre-final years I would say be calm, start early, and work really hard.

Hello everyone. Basically, as a product manager, one has to work with the Business, Technical and the User Experience functions and look into identifying the needs of the customer, the end-to-end process of ideation and development of product solutions that cater to those needs and finally making sure that the product reaches the customer. Ok Kavita. Now as we have grabbed the basics of this field, could you describe the general interview process for your company? First, there was a deck submission for which a problem statement(PS) was given and we got a window of 10\u00e2\u20ac\u201c15 days to prepare it. Based on the deck, shortlisting was done. After that, we had our Campus interviews. There were 3 rounds. These rounds were related to Problem Solving, Product Thinking and Technical Understanding Cases. Thanks Kavita for explaining about the general interview process. Could you please tell us about the first round? In the first round, we had problem-solving and product-thinking cases. In Problem Solving Cases, we have to find hidden problems and their solutions for a given product. For example the usage of an app has gone down by 10%, why? In Product Thinking Cases, we have to come up with creative product solutions. For example design Netflix for kids. To prepare for these, one can go through books like Cracking the PM Interview and Preparing for Product Interviews by IIT Madras. StellarPeers is also a good platform for this. You must also form a case group along with people sharing similar interests and solve cases together. That would be really helpful. Now can you tell us about the second round? The second round was regarding technical understanding or products. I was asked questions about a popular app and how it worked from a backend point-of-view. Also, I had to list the technical elements that are at play to ensure that the app runs smoothly. I was also asked to describe how the algorithm of the app works and if I have to build a similar app, what are the technical elements and backend process flow I would incorporate. There were more such situational tech-questions and I was asked to describe some technical terms too. For this, one can refer to the book Swipe to Unlock and go through tech blogs of product-based companies. So Kavita, is coding knowledge required for this field or an overview is enough? It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s better to have some coding knowledge since a PM has to interact a lot with the technical team. But you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re not expected to actually code, you just need to know the basics of how things work. Very well, then it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d be quite a nice alternative for all students who don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t like to code. Can you just enlighten us more about the third round? In the third round, I was asked questions related to problem-solving strategies such as defining users for a particular app, determining KPIs to measure a particular parameter under certain constraints etc. Then the interviewer asked some questions regarding the field of product management, like \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Why do you want to be a product manager?\u00e2\u20ac\u009d,\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Why are you the ideal candidate for this role?\u00e2\u20ac\u009d,\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Tell me about the time when you led a team\u00e2\u20ac\u009d etc. It was more like a mentor to mentee discussion and he asked me if I had any questions too. I discussed with him the scope of this role at large. I would like to clear one query that is, is it possible to have the preparation for both Consulting and Product Management? Yes, it is possible to prepare for both. In fact, sometimes, we used to solve Consult cases from Case Interviews Cracked by IIT Bombay and DayOne by IIT Madras. It really helps in broadening the perspective. Thank you Kavita for the insights. Does having a POR help in the shortlisting of the candidates? I think if you have worked in a team, it really enhances your leadership skills and personality as a team player and that shows in the selection process. I would like to ask, is it necessary to prepare for this field right from the first or second year? For the first or second-year students, it is too early to prepare for any specific field and focus solely on placements. It is better to explore as much as possible and get a good understanding of the various areas that seem interesting and then make an informed decision for the future. Surely, your advice will be really valuable for all of us. So, I think I have reached the end of my questions. So, is there any message you want to give to your juniors in KGP? I would like to emphasise that the campus really has a lot to offer in every direction and the best way is to explore and learn along with your batchmates. That way the learning process becomes much more enjoyable. The seniors in KGP are the best resources and they are extremely approachable, they can guide you about what is right and what is not. Keep doing something, anything! Just don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t let the most beautiful years of your life go in vain. Make the most of it! All the best! Hello everyone, today we have Kavita Priyadarshini who has been placed at Razorpay. So we are here to interview her regarding her preparations and strategies to crack the interview of this company. So firstly could you explain to us about the field of \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcProduct Management\u00e2\u20ac\u2122? Hello everyone. Basically, as a product manager, one has to work with the Business, Technical and the User Experience functions and look into identifying the needs of the customer, the end-to-end process of ideation and development of product solutions that cater to those needs and finally making sure that the product reaches the customer. Ok Kavita. Now as we have grabbed the basics of this field, could you describe the general interview process for your company? First, there was a deck submission for which a problem statement(PS) was given and we got a window of 10\u00e2\u20ac\u201c15 days to prepare it. Based on the deck, shortlisting was done. After that, we had our Campus interviews. There were 3 rounds. These rounds were related to Problem Solving, Product Thinking and Technical Understanding Cases. Thanks Kavita for explaining about the general interview process. Could you please tell us about the first round? In the first round, we had problem-solving and product-thinking cases. In Problem Solving Cases, we have to find hidden problems and their solutions for a given product. For example the usage of an app has gone down by 10%, why? In Product Thinking Cases, we have to come up with creative product solutions. For example design Netflix for kids. To prepare for these, one can go through books like Cracking the PM Interview and Preparing for Product Interviews by IIT Madras. StellarPeers is also a good platform for this. You must also form a case group along with people sharing similar interests and solve cases together. That would be really helpful. Now can you tell us about the second round? The second round was regarding technical understanding or products. I was asked questions about a popular app and how it worked from a backend point-of-view. Also, I had to list the technical elements that are at play to ensure that the app runs smoothly. I was also asked to describe how the algorithm of the app works and if I have to build a similar app, what are the technical elements and backend process flow I would incorporate. There were more such situational tech-questions and I was asked to describe some technical terms too. For this, one can refer to the book Swipe to Unlock and go through tech blogs of product-based companies. So Kavita, is coding knowledge required for this field or an overview is enough? It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s better to have some coding knowledge since a PM has to interact a lot with the technical team. But you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re not expected to actually code, you just need to know the basics of how things work. Very well, then it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d be quite a nice alternative for all students who don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t like to code. Can you just enlighten us more about the third round? In the third round, I was asked questions related to problem-solving strategies such as defining users for a particular app, determining KPIs to measure a particular parameter under certain constraints etc. Then the interviewer asked some questions regarding the field of product management, like \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Why do you want to be a product manager?\u00e2\u20ac\u009d,\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Why are you the ideal candidate for this role?\u00e2\u20ac\u009d,\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Tell me about the time when you led a team\u00e2\u20ac\u009d etc. It was more like a mentor to mentee discussion and he asked me if I had any questions too. I discussed with him the scope of this role at large. I would like to clear one query that is, is it possible to have the preparation for both Consulting and Product Management?

Hello everyone. Product Management is all about taking care of a product and making sure that the product works as desired by the company and is able to achieve its goals. Every product has its own requirements and different target customers. You\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll have to balance the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s needs and customer satisfaction and coalesce them into something which can form a tangible product. So it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more of a management role rather than something which involves hard technical skills. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more about coordinating between a lot of teams and bringing them together in a coherent form and getting something out. This is what product management is. Now as we have grabbed the basics of this field, could you describe the general interview process for your company? Yeah sure. The interview process was of 3 rounds, each being a knockout. The first was a business round, the second was a technical one and the third round was conducted by the Hiring Manager. Can you elaborate the business-round and tell us how to prepare for that? In this round, I was asked about a product case and many were asked for guesstimates. To prepare for it, shift your focus to case studies and case interviews. All management roles will have some form of case interviews in their selection process. The questions might vary but the underlying concepts will be the same. An important skill that managers need is to convey complex information in a structured way. Communicating structurally is very important to get your point across. Case interviews show how you think. The more cases you face, the more you enhance your structural thinking. For business cases, there are tons of resources available on the internet. Once you get the idea of how to think structurally, then you can shift to product cases. Solving cases is not something which you can learn academically but experientially over time. That would be really helpful. Now can you tell us about the second round? The second round was a technical one. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s to test whether you can talk to engineers or not. The engineers will be coding the recommendations you give to them. So you do need to have a basic understanding of the technical domain and stuff like how websites are created, how databases are maintained, how encryption works and a lot of things. They don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t expect you to code, but they just want you to know the basics. If you can just draw it on the whiteboard all you meant to convey, that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d be enough. The engineers there are specialized to do the coding work. Very well, then it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d be quite a nice alternative for all students who don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t like to code. Can you just enlighten us more about the third round where you face the Hiring manager? The third round is taken by the hiring manager who has the freedom to ask anything but it was mainly business oriented for me where I was asked product interviews. It was kinda impromptu, as they asked me my favourite product and then they started grilling me on it.As far I know there are no books for its preparation. Product cases, in general, require high awareness about the current developments in the fields and in general. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s something which you cannot know in a short period of time. You have to keep in touch for months. Then only you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be able to form an opinion on it. You need to grab every single opportunity to showcase your skills. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Which is your favourite product or app?\u00e2\u20ac\u009d. This is a very trivial question that needs to be answered wisely. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s good to have two to three apps in mind, which may not be your favourite but you know a great deal about them. Try to answer in context to the round. Like in the business round, try answering the app whose business plan you know the best. This will differentiate you from the crowd. Thanks for your valuable information Praveen. Also, can you tell us, what are the questions that are frequently asked in each round which are most difficult for many students, specifically in HR round? There was no dedicated HR round but those questions were sprinkled all over. Some questions that are asked frequently are; your reason behind pursuing this field, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Why product management\u00e2\u20ac\u009d and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Why this particular company\u00e2\u20ac\u009d. These are very important questions, you need to back yourself properly. You need to show that the decision you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve made to switch over to product is based on your interest in the field rather than any other motivations. One general advice for HR questions, always answer them in a structured format because they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll judge your structural communication in pretty much everything Thanks a lot for letting us know. And how far do the positions of responsibility on the campus help you Yeah they surely give you an edge over the rest but they play a substantial role only until the shortlisting. After that, your performance in the case interviews takes precedence. Even if you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have that bright a CV you shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get disheartened. Most companies ask you to submit an assignment (a case study, product proposal etc.) in the first round of shortlisting. If you put in efforts in the assignment and perform well in the case interviews, you have a good chance of getting selected. How has life in KGP has supported you for this role? My time in KGP has definitely aided me in developing a variety of skills. KGP provided me with a platform through which I could access learning opportunities in the form of internships, projects and courses. My projects and internships improved my technical skills while my participation in interhall case studies gave me the essence of case interviews. More importantly, I am thankful for the people I met on campus. I was exposed to diverse perspectives which broadened my thinking. It also gave me a case group to practice cases. I am very grateful to the institute for that. This will surely motivate a lot of students. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s all from my side Praveen. If you have any tips from your side, any useful resources that everyone should know about this field, and are left uncovered, you can just elaborate that? I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d like to suggest all to read more technical stuff, modern innovations, general trivia that you can sprinkle in between your interview to project an image that you are abreast with the developments. Product management is a very competitive role as I mentioned, there are very few openings each year. Always seek these small opportunities to showcase your general awareness that will differentiate you. Hello everyone, today we have Mr Praveen Chavali who has been placed at Razorpay.

Product management is a very competitive role as I mentioned, there are very few openings each year. Always seek these small opportunities to showcase your general awareness that will differentiate you. Secondly, product cases generally tend to be broad. You can explore a multitude of avenues but it is important to keep time in mind. You are expected to arrive at a conclusion in about 30 mins. If you aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t able to give a solution in the allotted time, it won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t give a good picture. So be quick while solving cases. Find people who\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re really good at solving cases and practice with them.

Also, how did you decide to go in the core profile? One of the reasons why I chose core Mechanical Engineering is by the time I completed my 3rd year and I was ready for placements. I had a research internship in the core field, I had a few involvements with research groups in the core field and I felt that I have expertise in that field. So I think it is a very important decision to take because thinking a bit ahead in your career and kind of being in a field in which you are trained in or you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re an expert in or feeling like you have the highest potential in, will actually give you a kind of inner motivation. So I think one of the pros of choosing the core field is that you already have a lot of experience in fact and you already have prior expertise in that. But of course, it is true that the opportunities in the core field are a bit less. Although not less but they are not that rewarding in the first few phases as compared to other fields so kind of builds up an intuition that core fields are tough but I would like to say that there are a lot of companies which give adequate remuneration if you consider the kind of growth opportunities you have and one of the most timely argument that I would like to give to anybody to fix the issue between core and non-core fields is to first realise where your expertise is. Like you may feel that you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re a good manager and have a lot more managerial skills. Then I think the next question should be what are the core properties I want to build? Like you could be a good manager but how? What do you think you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re a good manager at? Are you good at managing designs? Are you good at taking design decisions? Are you good at taking innovative decisions? So that is how I think. A lot of whys\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 need to be asked before deciding which field to choose and in my personal case, like on Day 1 of placements I had actually 3 companies in my mind. The first one was Sony, Japan which had a profile in Robotics, the next was ITC which was mostly managerial but as far as I can say it was mostly on Operations Management and third was Jaguar and Land Rover which was about automotive design and stuff. So I first decided what are my core competencies and I realized I have a lot of experience in automobile design and robotics of course. So that is how I started out so realizing where your expertise lies will actually help you in deciding your profile and which companies you want to go for. Also, before you go for companies and stuff you need to sit down and ask yourself a why question which is like suppose I want to go for consulting so my first question would be why? So I should list out a few factors like maybe I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m good at coming to innovative decisions, or maybe I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m good at seeing things from a broader perspective which is good for consulting or maybe that yeah I love a job which helps me in travelling. So after you have those things settled out you have to again ask yourself a why question like why am I good at innovation so you could know that ok well I can connect dots before people can and so on and finally why do you want a job that gives you the scope to experiment at various places and you think that you love innovating. So I think it boils these questions down to find a core pattern of your expertise and from that I think you should choose the company you want to go for. Also, many of us have heard that for going into the core sector your CG should be high and then only you should aim for the core. So would you like to comment on that statement? I think when you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re applying in core then there is something that I call as the Goldilocks zone for CG at end of 8th semester which for Mechanical is roughly around like I think if you have a 9+ CG it could but the interviewer in dilemma whether to take you or not because at 9.1 or 9.2 CG you can get into foreign universities and recruiters do not want to recruit you if you want to go for higher studies. So the Goldiloc\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Zone for CG is mostly around 8.5 to 9.1. And if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re above 9, then the basic question you need to answer is why don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t you want to go for higher studies? So that is a question you always have in the back of your mind when you go with a high CG. If you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re below 8.5 or 8.6 then the question that comes to you is that what is the reason you have a low CG? So there the question actually falls in 2 places \u00e2\u20ac\u201d the first one is you can say that I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m good in the core field, but some other subjects like Biology and Economics which I was kind of forced to take as a part of the curriculum are the reason, and the other thing is that you can always balance your CG with a mix of your aptitude. Like your work experience aptitude. And how that works is like you can say that I have worked in fields which required me to work on knowledge that is not much covered in my curriculum like e.g. you can say that I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m good in power systems and power systems are not covered in mechanical curriculum. So I think there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s always a place for rational decision on this part but the point is that you need to clear it for the interview round and for that if your CG is below 8.5 then it will be most good for you to do well in the pre-interview tests. That is where I think some of your focus should go to if your CG is between 8.5\u00e2\u20ac\u201c9.1 Okay so my next question is what was the general interview process for the companies you aimed for? In most of the companies I went for there were mostly 1 or 2 rounds of interviews. In JLR there were 2 rounds but I had to do only 1, I think I was fortunate in that part. In most of the interviews there were actually 3 parts. So the first part is where they ask you general process about mechanical engineering and in this part for some companies like ITC and somewhat in Bajaj Auto also that give you an option to choose your preferred subject and in others like JLR and Sony, Japan they come out with their own questionnaire to maintain uniformity across students. But whatever be the case you should always be ready for answering the questions out of you comfort zone also and in your comfort zone you should be able to answer questions which involve critical thinking. Another important thing in this part is most of the questions are actually related to practical applications such as what is the loading pattern? How do you pull that? So I think it is important for anybody who\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s interested to prepare for questions on practical applications and critical thinking and this can be thoroughly developed through hands-on experience either via research groups, projects or internships. Next part of the interview is the CV round. In this round they run through your CV for what you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve done. They try to find out what you have obtained from the work you did and they often ask you how you can replicate that experience in the scenario that they have set up for themselves. So for example I was working at University of Tokyo on Intelligent Vehicle Systems and they asked me that if Jaguar Land Rover wants to launch an intelligent vehicle then what is your role as a mechanical engineer in supporting that. So that I think is the exercise we need to do. So go through the details of the job you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re appearing for and how your past experience is linked to it. And the third and the final round is what people call the HR round and in my case, JLR asked me guesstimate questions, they asked me questions about how I manage teams and how I work with teams and what\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s my overview on project management. I believe it isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t something that can be built in a day but of course you can go through a lot of management books and other books you have interest in and that gives a fair idea of what you need to do. At the end of the day I think being able to find out things from your experience which relates to that question is all that you need to do. Any resources you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d like to mention which you used while your preparation? Eg- any additionals you took, online courses, etc. So I was involved in various places and hence I learned a lot from there. But I think uniformly you need to revisit everything you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve mentioned in your CV and you should know what you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re speaking of. Apart from that, for core I think you should go through a book that details out everything important which is just for the review before the interview to revise all the concepts. For the placement session it is important to give yourself a complete exposure to quantitative reasoning problems. At the back of your mind your analytical reasoning capacity should be good. And also if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re in touch with those things then it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s easier for you to come up with a solution and also most of the people will also be open for the consulting profile so there are some mathematical models that you can use. Also, it is useful to have concise notes of the subject matter for a revision before the interview. Particularly for JLR, question sets from Gate entrance are a good resource for core mechanical engg. practice. Months before the placement session is it important to have daily practice of coding and reasoning question sets, these are crucial parts of the pre-interview tests. In this regard, having a peer group helps to remain focussed and derive motivation. Please avail test series if possible. Apart from all this some overview on guess-estimates and mathematical models will help. So my next question to you is about your strategy of preparation. Did you change it depending on which company you were aiming for and in between rounds? For every company there is actually a kind of mindset which they come for like when you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re sitting for something like ITC we should be aware they are very much focused on your analytical ability. Which is like they want from you to solve problems that other people in your place cannot solve. However in JLR, when you need to provide them is that you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re an integral part of the team and you can work wherever it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s required and you have a decent exposure to the work. But in places like Sony, Japan what they want from you is that you should have a prior experience in your work area. So for every company you need to know what is it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s type of interview, you need to find out from people what is the kind of preparation that you need to do and you need to change your strategy, of course. You need to have a predefined strategy for each company. What advice would you like to give your juniors who will be sitting for placements this year? For placement you have to build up on the work you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve done. You have to justify to them how exactly their requirements are met by you? And my advice to anybody sitting for any company they want to is to form a strategy as we talked before which is particular for that company to know what kind of interview process it is and then strategize your resources in that manner and I think that is the exercise you can do for a month before your actual placements, So the day you fill in for the company you should actually have an idea about what they might ask like this interview is going to be about my CV, so I would have every point of my CV in my mind and I would have a defence for every word that is in my CV which they may ask about. Or maybe for company like JLR, I would know that I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m going to face a lot of questions on core mechanical concepts so let me have a cheat sheet where I have all those formulas and all those concepts written so that would actually give you the confidence to go in for the interview and that is the best advice, to have different strategies and have prior knowledge about every company that you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re going to sit for. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s quite useful advice. So my last question to you is if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d like to say something to the general KGP public out there? Any advice for them? Yeah, so I think a lot of people want to go into core sectors. Also one of the most lucrative options of the core sectors is that you can work on your expertise and that what is more important for you is to know what you want to play out in these parts of your life. So it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s basically like seeing this resource in a broader perspective and being very focused on it. So you need to know what it is that you want to take after being at a company. Do you want to be in that job for 5\u00e2\u20ac\u201c10 years? Or you want to be in management so you want to take off a little bit of time to go ahead. So that will give you a very clear idea about what kind of companies and what kind of field you want to go for. That I think is another important thing while choosing the company. So I think in the whole placement process, choosing your company is as much as being there in the interview because what it does is in the interview process it takes away much of your load off as you then have a lot of information which empowers you to go there and deliver almost everything that you know. So then you have a lot less surprises in the interview and you can actually give your best. What was the general interview process for the companies that you aimed for? Also, how did you decide to go in the core profile? One of the reasons why I chose core Mechanical Engineering is by the time I completed my 3rd year and I was ready for placements. I had a research internship in the core field, I had a few involvements with research groups in the core field and I felt that I have expertise in that field. So I think it is a very important decision to take because thinking a bit ahead in your career and kind of being in a field in which you are trained in or you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re an expert in or feeling like you have the highest potential in, will actually give you a kind of inner motivation. So I think one of the pros of choosing the core field is that you already have a lot of experience in fact and you already have prior expertise in that. But of course, it is true that the opportunities in the core field are a bit less. Although not less but they are not that rewarding in the first few phases as compared to other fields so kind of builds up an intuition that core fields are tough but I would like to say that there are a lot of companies which give adequate remuneration if you consider the kind of growth opportunities you have and one of the most timely argument that I would like to give to anybody to fix the issue between core and non-core fields is to first realise where your expertise is. Like you may feel that you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re a good manager and have a lot more managerial skills. Then I think the next question should be what are the core properties I want to build? Like you could be a good manager but how? What do you think you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re a good manager at? Are you good at managing designs? Are you good at taking design decisions? Are you good at taking innovative decisions? So that is how I think. A lot of whys\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 need to be asked before deciding which field to choose and in my personal case, like on Day 1 of placements I had actually 3 companies in my mind. The first one was Sony, Japan which had a profile in Robotics, the next was ITC which was mostly managerial but as far as I can say it was mostly on Operations Management and third was Jaguar and Land Rover which was about automotive design and stuff. So I first decided what are my core competencies and I realized I have a lot of experience in automobile design and robotics of course. So that is how I started out so realizing where your expertise lies will actually help you in deciding your profile and which companies you want to go for. Also, before you go for companies and stuff you need to sit down and ask yourself a why question which is like suppose I want to go for consulting so my first question would be why? So I should list out a few factors like maybe I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m good at coming to innovative decisions, or maybe I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m good at seeing things from a broader perspective which is good for consulting or maybe that yeah I love a job which helps me in travelling. So after you have those things settled out you have to again ask yourself a why question like why am I good at innovation so you could know that ok well I can connect dots before people can and so on and finally why do you want a job that gives you the scope to experiment at various places and you think that you love innovating. So I think it boils these questions down to find a core pattern of your expertise and from that I think you should choose the company you want to go for. Also, many of us have heard that for going into the core sector your CG should be high and then only you should aim for the core. So would you like to comment on that statement? I think when you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re applying in core then there is something that I call as the Goldilocks zone for CG at end of 8th semester which for Mechanical is roughly around like I think if you have a 9+ CG it could but the interviewer in dilemma whether to take you or not because at 9.1 or 9.2 CG you can get into foreign universities and recruiters do not want to recruit you if you want to go for higher studies. So the Goldiloc\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Zone for CG is mostly around 8.5 to 9.1. And if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re above 9, then the basic question you need to answer is why don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t you want to go for higher studies? So that is a question you always have in the back of your mind when you go with a high CG. If you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re below 8.5 or 8.6 then the question that comes to you is that what is the reason you have a low CG? So there the question actually falls in 2 places \u00e2\u20ac\u201d the first one is you can say that I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m good in the core field, but some other subjects like Biology and Economics which I was kind of forced to take as a part of the curriculum are the reason, and the other thing is that you can always balance your CG with a mix of your aptitude. Like your work experience aptitude. And how that works is like you can say that I have worked in fields which required me to work on knowledge that is not much covered in my curriculum like e.g. you can say that I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m good in power systems and power systems are not covered in mechanical curriculum. So I think there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s always a place for rational decision on this part but the point is that you need to clear it for the interview round and for that if your CG is below 8.5 then it will be most good for you to do well in the pre-interview tests. That is where I think some of your focus should go to if your CG is between 8.5\u00e2\u20ac\u201c9.1 Okay so my next question is what was the general interview process for the companies you aimed for? In most of the companies I went for there were mostly 1 or 2 rounds of interviews. In JLR there were 2 rounds but I had to do only 1, I think I was fortunate in that part. In most of the interviews there were actually 3 parts. So the first part is where they ask you general process about mechanical engineering and in this part for some companies like ITC and somewhat in Bajaj Auto also that give you an option to choose your preferred subject and in others like JLR and Sony, Japan they come out with their own questionnaire to maintain uniformity across students. But whatever be the case you should always be ready for answering the questions out of you comfort zone also and in your comfort zone you should be able to answer questions which involve critical thinking. Another important thing in this part is most of the questions are actually related to practical applications such as what is the loading pattern? How do you pull that? So I think it is important for anybody who\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s interested to prepare for questions on practical applications and critical thinking and this can be thoroughly developed through hands-on experience either via research groups, projects or internships. Next part of the interview is the CV round. In this round they run through your CV for what you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve done. They try to find out what you have obtained from the work you did and they often ask you how you can replicate that experience in the scenario that they have set up for themselves. So for example I was working at University of Tokyo on Intelligent Vehicle Systems and they asked me that if Jaguar Land Rover wants to launch an intelligent vehicle then what is your role as a mechanical engineer in supporting that. So that I think is the exercise we need to do. So go through the details of the job you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re appearing for and how your past experience is linked to it. And the third and the final round is what people call the HR round and in my case, JLR asked me guesstimate questions, they asked me questions about how I manage teams and how I work with teams and what\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s my overview on project management. I believe it isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t something that can be built in a day but of course you can go through a lot of management books and other books you have interest in and that gives a fair idea of what you need to do. At the end of the day I think being able to find out things from your experience which relates to that question is all that you need to do. Any resources you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d like to mention which you used while your preparation? Eg- any additionals you took, online courses, etc. So I was involved in various places and hence I learned a lot from there. But I think uniformly you need to revisit everything you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve mentioned in your CV and you should know what you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re speaking of.

I was genuinely interested in naval architecture from my first year itself. I did my internship in the core area in my 3rd year. I also did some research work in this field. So, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s basically my subject of interest and hence I went for it. What was the general interview process (number of rounds, questions asked, topics they questioned about in each round, etc.) for the companies that you aimed for? The first selection was CV based. Then there was a written test. 60 questions are from discipline subject having difficulty level similar to GATE Exam. And rest 25 questions are based on reasoning, data interpretation, and some numerical questions. Around 60% was the qualifying criteria for the next round.There was no GD but a direct round table PI. There were no separate technical or HR rounds. 9 people from the administrative side of the company comprising of HR and tech persons asked questions from different segments. They selected in the ratio of 1:5 i.e. 1 out of 5 people from one round of PI. Many of us have heard that one should aim for going into the core sector only when your CG is high. Would you like to comment on that statement? Well it doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t depend on CGPA totally. If your resume is very good, then you can get a relaxation in CGPA. A good CGPA is a plus point. POR is important in the resume. I was the Hall President of Radhakrishnan Hall of Residence and hence it was a plus point for me. Actually PSUs also prefer students who are hardworking as well as research-oriented. My internship in the Indian Register of Shipping, Bombay was research-based and hence provided an edge over others. Any resources you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d like to mention which you used while preparing? Eg- any additionals you took, online courses, etc. For core, you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t need to take additional courses. Whatever the professors taught was quite enough. In naval architecture, Hydrostatics and Stability and Marine Design are very important. So if you follow the course curriculum with interest then it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s enough for the preparation. I made a LPG carrier ship model and the interviewers were quite interested in that. So such small projects were very effective in such interviews. What was your strategy for preparation? Did you change it depending on which company you were aiming for and in between rounds? Basically I was aiming for two core companies only. And I had the same preparation for both of them. One day before the interview, I just researched a bit about the company. Other than this, everything was the same. What advice would you like to give your juniors who will be sitting for placements this year? For placements in such companies, I would tell the juniors to give their interview with full enthusiasm. Try to answer the questions in a bit funny way. I did hall dramatics and they asked me to enact a small role from a play. So if you are interactive and answer the questions with humor then they will definitely take you as a unique person and increase your chances of getting selected. What would you like to say to the general KGP public out there? Any advice for them? If you are interested in coding or core, do pursue your interest. And be interactive with everyone.

Right from my second year, I started exploring the core and non-core sectors. At the end of the second year finally, I felt that I was more inclined towards the core sector as I always wanted to make my career in a field in which interaction with people was more than interaction with machines. I knew that I couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t sit in front of a PC for 4 to 5 hours and do coding. One plus point of Civil Engineering is that in the core sector, candidates have both options, either you can go to the private sector or to a government job. In the private sector, the work pressure will be a bit higher but at the same time, there will be more learning opportunities. While working in the private sector you will feel like an entrepreneur after a few years of experience as you will be handling multi-crore projects equivalent to the size of small-cap companies. It is a high-risk job where a single small mistake can cost you lacs of rupees, and therefore, the remuneration will be high too. As a fresher in this industry having zero experience and zero risk handling capacity you will be paid low initially but, with experience, you can achieve exponential career growth. If you see the government sector then UPSC (ESE) is the best achievable option. It gives you techno-managerial job opportunities as well as social privileges. Work pressure is a little less in comparison to the private sector. Considering all these factors, I started preparing for UPSC(ESE), a competitive exam conducted by UPSC for recruitment of candidates in various engineering positions in government departments. Accordingly, I did my compulsory internship in a PSU only. In my third year, I was wholeheartedly preparing for the ESE\/GATE exam and I was not targeting on-campus placements, but in late November and early December, I feared to miss out on any available Opportunities during the campus placements. I was in a great dilemma as my main exam was in early January only and I knew that the placement phase is very turbulent and could harm my preparation for the exam, but I finally decided to put in efforts for the core companies visiting the campus. What was the general interview process for the companies that you had given interviews for? I had appeared for 3 companies and in every company, the general interview process was almost similar. Firstly, there was a resume\/CV selection round, then an aptitude test and then one round of personal interview. Is it true that a high CG is required to pursue your interests in the core field? Yes, it is true that there is a requirement of higher CGPA for core sectors but the range depends upon the position you are applying for. If you are going for the R&D team then definitely higher CGPA students will be preferred by the recruiters. If you are going for the execution\/operation team for the techno-managerial job then CGPA above 8 will have more chances. Mostly Civil core companies hire UGs for techno-managerial work only. Design and research are expected from PGs or PhDs. What were the resources that you while your preparation? Eg- any additionals, online courses etc. And how did they help you? Since I was preparing for the UPSC(ESE) so I was following study materials of a coaching institute that helped me a lot in the departmental subjects. I relied completely on the information available in those materials to revise my core topics. And it helped me a lot in the interview of L&T Construction too. Can you list some of the questions that were asked to you during the interview? In the interview with L&T Construction, they mostly asked about the in-depth details of projects. Design sessional project is important as it gives a good idea of the construction of multistorey buildings. They asked me about the location of the structure, its zone of earthquake, wind zone etc. You need to be accurate with numbers and values. I remember my interview took place through a VC and they cross-checked my answer on the internet about the earthquake zone of the location told by me. Practical questions from the internship experience were asked. Basic questions from the Course \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcRC structures\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 like Why should we do curing?, 7-day strength percentage?, What does M20 Mean? Etc. were some of the questions that they asked. They were expecting full definition type answers from me. Never forget to revise EIA if you have mentioned in your resume. It is a very hot topic in the construction industry in India these days. None of the companies asked any guesstimates or analytical questions. I did not get much time to practice aptitude problems but I referred to RS Agrawal for aptitude part in the time available to me. What were your involvements in KGP and how did they help you? I have been an active member of the organising team of \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcMegalith\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, which is the departmental fest of the Civil Engineering Department. In my view societies and groups help in making a bigger friend circle, personality development and many other things depending upon in which field that society\/group is active. I guess any other involvement, other than academics will not help you in any way in civil core companies placement, but definitely having its experiences will help you at your workplace. What advice would you like to give your juniors sitting for placements this year? This year there will be some impact on hiring due to the recession. But remember, your technical skills are your assets. Make your technical skills strong in a particular field. Take the help of your seniors to get an overview like what type questions were asked and general interview process etc. During preparation, take out some time and have a talk with your friends. This will help you and your friend feel positive. Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t worry too much, everything will be good at the end. Would you like to say something to the general KGP junta out there? And perhaps give them a message? I would only like to say that, explore your interest while you are in KGP but at the same time be cautious and avoid wasting time in the name of exploring. Make friends, learn technical skills and be positive all the time. Baki toh KGP ka tempo high rehta hi hai. Hello Mukesh, I am from Communiqu\u00c3\u00a9, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d like to ask you a few questions regarding your placement at L&T for our initiative, CQ Core Combat. Sure, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d love to answer. How and when did you decide that you wanted to get into the core profile? Right from my second year, I started exploring the core and non-core sectors. At the end of the second year finally, I felt that I was more inclined towards the core sector as I always wanted to make my career in a field in which interaction with people was more than interaction with machines.

Work pressure is a little less in comparison to the private sector. Considering all these factors, I started preparing for UPSC(ESE), a competitive exam conducted by UPSC for recruitment of candidates in various engineering positions in government departments. Accordingly, I did my compulsory internship in a PSU only. In my third year, I was wholeheartedly preparing for the ESE\/GATE exam and I was not targeting on-campus placements, but in late November and early December, I feared to miss out on any available Opportunities during the campus placements. I was in a great dilemma as my main exam was in early January only and I knew that the placement phase is very turbulent and could harm my preparation for the exam, but I finally decided to put in efforts for the core companies visiting the campus. What was the general interview process for the companies that you had given interviews for? I had appeared for 3 companies and in every company, the general interview process was almost similar. Firstly, there was a resume\/CV selection round, then an aptitude test and then one round of personal interview. Is it true that a high CG is required to pursue your interests in the core field? Yes, it is true that there is a requirement of higher CGPA for core sectors but the range depends upon the position you are applying for. If you are going for the R&D team then definitely higher CGPA students will be preferred by the recruiters. If you are going for the execution\/operation team for the techno-managerial job then CGPA above 8 will have more chances. Mostly Civil core companies hire UGs for techno-managerial work only. Design and research are expected from PGs or PhDs. What were the resources that you while your preparation? Eg- any additionals, online courses etc. And how did they help you? Since I was preparing for the UPSC(ESE) so I was following study materials of a coaching institute that helped me a lot in the departmental subjects. I relied completely on the information available in those materials to revise my core topics. And it helped me a lot in the interview of L&T Construction too. Can you list some of the questions that were asked to you during the interview? In the interview with L&T Construction, they mostly asked about the in-depth details of projects. Design sessional project is important as it gives a good idea of the construction of multistorey buildings. They asked me about the location of the structure, its zone of earthquake, wind zone etc. You need to be accurate with numbers and values. I remember my interview took place through a VC and they cross-checked my answer on the internet about the earthquake zone of the location told by me. Practical questions from the internship experience were asked. Basic questions from the Course \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcRC structures\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 like Why should we do curing?, 7-day strength percentage?, What does M20 Mean? Etc. were some of the questions that they asked. They were expecting full definition type answers from me. Never forget to revise EIA if you have mentioned in your resume. It is a very hot topic in the construction industry in India these days. None of the companies asked any guesstimates or analytical questions. I did not get much time to practice aptitude problems but I referred to RS Agrawal for aptitude part in the time available to me. What were your involvements in KGP and how did they help you? I have been an active member of the organising team of \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcMegalith\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, which is the departmental fest of the Civil Engineering Department. In my view societies and groups help in making a bigger friend circle, personality development and many other things depending upon in which field that society\/group is active. I guess any other involvement, other than academics will not help you in any way in civil core companies placement, but definitely having its experiences will help you at your workplace. What advice would you like to give your juniors sitting for placements this year? This year there will be some impact on hiring due to the recession. But remember, your technical skills are your assets. Make your technical skills strong in a particular field. Take the help of your seniors to get an overview like what type questions were asked and general interview process etc. During preparation, take out some time and have a talk with your friends. This will help you and your friend feel positive. Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t worry too much, everything will be good at the end. Would you like to say something to the general KGP junta out there? And perhaps give them a message? I would only like to say that, explore your interest while you are in KGP but at the same time be cautious and avoid wasting time in the name of exploring. Make friends, learn technical skills and be positive all the time. Baki toh KGP ka tempo high rehta hi hai.

Truly speaking, I knew from the beginning that I have no interest in coding and all or I am not made for coding, So I never tried to pursue it. Talking about the core profile, I gradually developed an interest in Geophysics during my 2nd and 3rd year, as Geology is more of multi-disciplinary science and not a fundamental science, as it uses the principles of physics, chemistry, biology, and mathematics to study the Earth. Along with that Geology and Geophysics have a wide range of applications in the real world like Geophysics is applied to societal needs, such as mineral resources, mitigation of natural hazards, and environmental protection, etc which basically acquired my interest. Also in IIT KGP, there are very few companies who come for hiring students from this department, but those companies are very esteemed oil sector companies like ExxonMobil, Schlumberger, etc. What was the general interview process (number of rounds, questions asked, topics they questioned about in each round, etc.) for the companies that you aimed for? The interview process generally includes 1) CV shortlists, 2) 30\u00e2\u20ac\u201c40 min objective type or aptitude test, 3) Personal Interview. ExxonMobil: CV shortlist on the basis of CG and Core internships. Followed by the Aptitude test which contains common verbal ability and logical reasoning questions. While in the personal interview round, they used to have both types of questions; HR type and Core & CV based. Schlumberger: CV shortlisting and PI round. ONGC: CV shortlisting and PI round. Vedanta Oil and Gas: CV shortlisting, Written Test (Objective and short answer type based on core topics ), and PI round. Major topics asked in the PI round are Seismic Methods, Borehole Geophysics (well logging), Gravity and Magnetic methods, Electrical methods of prospecting, General Geology, structural geology, Geophysical signal processing. Many of us have heard that one should aim for going into the core sector only when your CG is high. Would you like to comment on that statement? No doubt higher CG people have better chances in core sectors but somewhere your CV, previous internships, and in-depth knowledge of core topics play a crucial role when you are aiming for the core sectors. Specifically speaking of the Geology and Geophysics department there are very few opportunities or companies with a low number of hirings. So definitely, If one wishes to go for core companies, he\/she should try to maintain 8+ CGPA. Any resources you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d like to mention which you used while preparing? Eg- any additionals you took, online courses, etc. I had mostly referred to the books and class notes for the preparation. I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t take any online courses or additionals that may aid in the core profile preparation. Few Book References are as follows: Introduction to geophysical prospecting (Dobrin) Seismic Data Processing \u00e2\u20ac\u201d Yilmaz Fundamentals of Geophysics, Willam Lowri Exploration Geophysics- Gaddhalah Geological_Interpretation_of_Well_Logs by Malcolm Rider What was your strategy for preparation? Did you change it depending on which company you were aiming for and in between rounds? My simple strategy was to review the previous question asked by the different companies and select those important subjects form which the question had been asked every year and prepare those subjects in a detailed and exhaustive manner so that I won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t miss any questions of a technical round. After that, the only thing left is the HR round and CV preparation like PORs, Projects, and Internship questions, which I prepared depending on the specific company. This was my strategy for the core companies and I stuck to it, didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t change it in between rounds and It worked just fine. What advice would you like to give your juniors who will be sitting for placements this year? My advice for the juniors those who are interested in core companies, do not solely depend on them only as there are only few companies who come for the placement like this year only two company came for the campus placements, Schlumberger and Vedanta Oil and gas did not come for the campus placements, so you can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t solely depend on the oil companies, Kindly prepare for the other job profiles as well apart from the core profile. What would you like to say to the general KGP public out there? Any advice for them? The Institute organizes various programs to improve soft skills, professional communication, and personality through career counseling kindly utilize those means or at least focus on these parts as well. While making your CV for different profiles, Keep your CV to the point and well organized. Choose your target companies wisely, explore various possibilities and profile. The placement process is quite hard and tiring, so stay strong throughout the process, work hard for it and rest assured you guys will land up in the good company and nice package.

I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve always been interested in the field of aerospace and aeronautical engineering.During my five years at IIT Kharagpur, I have had a diverse experience. I got to know what particularly interests me in Aerospace Engineering. I enjoyed understanding the thermodynamics and aerodynamic concepts of propulsion systems and experimenting on them through my projects. I even forayed out of my comfort zone into non-core domains like Finance and Data Analytics. I took a liking to the financial subjects.While it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s true that people fancy coding and data-analytics jobs more, I strongly believe that the core profiles were and shall remain evergreen. I chose a core job because I felt it to be my calling at this moment. I guess I was more inclined towards those from the beginning as my father was in ISRO. His profession excited me enough to take up this field and I ended up choosing Aerospace Engineering here at IIT Kharagpur. What was the general interview process (number of rounds, questions asked, topics they questioned about in each round, etc.) for the companies that you aimed for? While I was more inclined to take core-jobs, and I had more than sufficient research experiences to hold my ground in the interview, I wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t confident about getting offers from core companies initially due to my mediocre CGPA. Core companies usually expect you to have a sound academic score, and while a 7.5+ GPA is acceptable, an 8+ GPA candidate with similar research experience would always have an upper hand. As a result, I took up the opportunity of applying in other profiles apart from Core. I was selected for the interview procedure of Halma PLC, JP Morgan on Day 1 and AB InBev, Fractal and Honeywell on Day 2. To be honest, the interviews of the Day-1 companies were more exhaustive. JP Morgan held 4\u00e2\u20ac\u201c5 rounds each focusing on a particular field. The first round was mainly CV-grilling followed by a coding round where they asked you about searching algorithms and coding puzzles. Preparation from G4G comes in handy over here. This was followed by a round focussed on Quant, where you are asked questions from Prob&Stats and puzzles. Sadly, I couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t hold my ground well in this round and wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t shortlisted for the next one. Halma also had an exhaustive interviewing procedure. An online test(quantitative and verbal reasoning) was conducted, followed by two psychometric online evaluations. This was followed by a short buddy session with a Halma representative where the shortlisted candidates could find out more about Halma and what life is like in the program. This was followed by a group-discussion round on Day-0 and the shortlisted candidates had to go through a thorough interview session on Day-1. The interview session is unlike any other. This is not a technical round, but more an extensive psychometric round where you are asked about your strengths and weaknesses in detail. They followed an experiential questioning technique, where the answers don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have a specific right or wrong. Questions like what a person learned from his past projects\/experiences, how he handled stressful situations, and how he approached solving open-ended problems. It was an exhaustive round that lasted for around an hour to an hour and a half depending on the candidate. The interview procedure for Honeywell included an online test(technical and quantitative), and two interview rounds (Technical and HR). The technical interview began with CV grilling where they asked about the core projects I worked on and went into finer details about some of them to grasp if the candidate has in-depth knowledge about that field. I was grilled on my MTP project and my work-experience in TeamKART, along with my participation in an international competition. Post the CV grilling, I was asked basic questions on thermodynamics and propulsion. This was followed by the HR round, where they tried to find out how well I knew about the company(if I was genuinely interested in joining them) and if I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d be a good fit for the team. Many of us have heard that one should aim for going into the core sector only when your CG is high. Would you like to comment on that statement? There is no denying the fact that CGPA matters a lot, specifically for core profiles. If there are two candidates with equally sound technical experience in their CV but one has a higher CGPA, he might still be preferred even if he doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have PoRs or extra-curricular activities to show in his CV. But keep it above 8, and you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re sure to get shortlisted for most of the companies provided that you prepared for the preliminary tests and have done well enough in those. With that being said, campus placements are anything but predictable. Any resources you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d like to mention which you used while preparing? Eg- any additionals you took, online courses, etc. For the people more inclined towards core jobs, make sure that you are well-versed in your technical field, and I cannot stress enough how important this is. You should obviously know your projects inside out, and be comfortable in explaining them in detail. Most of my electives in my final and pre-final years were mainly in the turbomachinery field and that helped me a bit at Honeywell. Some programming knowledge wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t do you any harm. What was your strategy for preparation? Did you change it depending on which company you were aiming for and in between rounds? Since I was studying for both core as well as the non-core profiles, I had to modify depending on the tests and the companies for which I was shortlisted. I initially studied for the core subjects making sure that I cover all the bases for interviews at core companies like Honeywell and Airbus. Post that I studied for quantitative and focused on my coding skills. During the last week, I focussed more on the quantitative and coding questions since I was shortlisted in non-core companies and in Honeywell for the first two days. Since I had already prepared my core subjects, I was confident about the technical sessions in the core companies. What advice would you like to give your juniors who will be sitting for placements this year? Given the corona pandemic and everything, my only advice to the junior junta is to stay strong and stay positive. Be ready to face rejections and surprises. Placements are anything but predictable, and with the looming threat of deep recession, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s even more so. There is no telling how the placement session would turn out, but there are a few things you can do: ensure that you duly utilize this time strengthening your skills and learning new ones; efficiently utilize the resources that IIT is offering you; prep well for the preliminary placements test. You\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll have to brush up your coding and quantitative skills for both the interviews and tests, so start early with that. Make sure that you have good networking with the KGP Alumnus so that in the worst-case if the placements don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t go so well this year, you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll have external support from them. What would you like to say to the general KGP public out there? Any advice for them? KGP provides a pretty good platform for you to excel in your career. Make sure to utilize it well. Explore as much as you can in the initial couple of years of the college. The institute offers opportunities in all the fields, so try them all out. If you want a research exposure, apply for FTs; if you need corporate exposure, apply for internships in start-ups. Once you have explored enough and have a basic idea about the profiles\/fields you are interested in, contact your seniors and try to understand the scope of those fields and if you are the fit for it. Make sure that by the time you reach the final year, you have enough experience and knowledge to hold your ground in the placement sessions.

Anything else that you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d want to share with the students? There is one thing I learned from the internship process. There will be times when you might not get shortlisted but you should never lose hope and give your best in the next coding tests. Always be in touch with your friends. Back to list","category":"Placement","profile":"Core","department":"Mechanical Engineering"},{"blog_id":28,"blog_text":"Jishnu Arun Lakhotia Placed at Texas Instruments Interviewed By: How did you decide to go in the core profile considering that coding and data are usually in vogue and are most talked about? I had explored coding in my second year. I was not able to understand some of the core subjects in the 3rd sem and had contacted one of my seniors for funda in coding. I started, continued for about two months or so, but could not develop interest. In the 4th sem, I gained interest in some of the core courses and wanted to give it a shot. I pursued it, studied thoroughly, and then things became clearer for me. Basically, you have to explore as many options as you can. Only then you can eliminate options as well. What was the general interview process for the companies that you aimed for? I will talk about the internship procedure. In core EC companies, there are mainly three rounds: the test, the PI, and the HR round. HR round of a core company is just a 2 min walk, so you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t need to worry about that. Some companies like Nvidia don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t conduct any tests. They shortlist on the basis of CGPA. As far as Texas Instruments is concerned, it is crucial to score good marks in the test because the shortlist comes on that basis only, and you will be called for PI in that order. And it is very beneficial if you are among the first few students to appear in the PI (comparatively easier questions!) Many of us have heard that one should aim for going into the core sector only when your CG is high. Would you like to comment on that statement? If you want to pursue higher studies, then you definitely need to maintain a high CGPA. But if you are looking to go into industry, then it does not matter that much. I have known people who are pursuing core but don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have that high CGPA. Scoring good marks in an exam is a different skill, and this skill is not required in the industry. If you have an interest in the core, you should definitely give it a try. Obviously, you need to clear the cut-off of the companies. Anything near 8 is good enough. Any resources you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d like to mention which you used while preparing? Eg- any additionals you took, online courses, etc. I had stayed in KGP during the summers of my 2nd year. I had attended the VLSI workshop organized by Prof Mrigank Sharad. Nowadays, he has stopped organizing the workshop due to some reasons, I think. Though it did not directly influence my internship preparation, we learned a lot of new things, tried our hands-on simulation, and he was able to increase my interest in the topic, despite the scorching heat here during the summers. What was your strategy for preparation? Did you change it depending on which company you were aiming for and in between rounds? How was the interview process? In EC core, only two companies (TI and Nvidia) come on day 2. The next is Qualcomm, which comes in the 3rd\/4th week. To be honest, I had no idea what I would have done if I had not gotten the TI offer. I had only prepared for the analog profile. But I think, since the core companies come at some intervals, one should prepare entirely based on the respective company. As far as TI analog is concerned, it is necessary and sufficient to read Razavi. It covers all topics which may be asked in the test\/interview in some detail. Razavi even helped me during the internship. I had contacted a senior regarding the type of questions that are usually asked in PI. They usually check the basics. Questions from RLC circuits, amplifiers, negative feedback, and basic Fourier transform are their favorites. The company even gives a list of topics that the student is expected to know. What advice would you like to give your juniors who will be sitting for placements this year? Stick to a particular book for a particular profile. Try to understand the smallest details. Keep your basics very clear. Reach out to your seniors. What would you like to say to the general KGP public out there? Any advice for them? This place has a lot to give. Make memories. Be kind.

I am very much interested in Aerospace engineering. I actually got my depC to Aerospace engineering from Metallurgy and Material Science engineering in 2nd year. I worked on two core projects in my 2nd and 3rd year. I did my internship at the department of Aerospace engineering, IIT Kanpur. Also, I took BTP and MTP in my department and worked sincerely. Working on these core projects, eventually, I grew my interest in fluid dynamics and the turbomachinery domain. So naturally, during placement, I had the desire to get placed in a core company related to my field of interest. What was the general interview process (number of rounds, questions asked, topics they questioned about in each round, etc.) for the companies that you aimed for? For Rolls Royce, there were 2 rounds of selection. Initially, a written exam was conducted. In the exam, there were 2 parts. The first part contained analytical questions, mostly on graphical interpretations, and was of 10 minutes duration. The 2nd part, which lasted for an hour, consisted of technical questions. The questions were mostly from the field of Aerospace and Mechanical Engineering. On the same day, the company released a shortlist (containing relatively less number of people than was expected) for interview based on the performance in the written exam. There was only one round of interview. My interview went for more than an hour. The interviewers asked me technical questions mostly from what I had done in my projects. They were more focused on my BTP and MTP project work as those projects were in the turbomachinery domain (one of the profiles they were looking for). They told me to describe the projects in detail and asked related questions. After the technical round, they asked a few HR questions. The questions in HR round were of typical nature, for example, the interviewers gave me a hypothetical office-crisis scenario and asked me how I would respond to that. Many of us have heard that one should aim for going into the core sector only when your CG is high. Would you like to comment on that statement? I think, if you are really interested in the core subjects, there is a high possibility that you will have a decent CG. However, to get a core job, it is not essential to have a high CG. Because, for many companies, there was no CG bar. For example, in Rolls Royce, everyone was allowed to take the written test. The students, qualifying the written test, were called for the interview. So, I feel, if you have excellent knowledge of core subjects and have done a few projects in a related domain, you can get placed in core companies. Nevertheless, it is always safe to maintain your CG. There are core companies that put a CG bar of 8 or 8.5. Any resources you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d like to mention which you used while preparing? Eg- any additionals you took, online courses, etc. Not as such. But, Core companies, in general, look for some particular profiles. So, it is important to have the relevant knowledge in the particular domain that the company is hiring for while applying for a core company. For instance, Rolls Royce was looking for three profiles 1) Turbomachinery 2) CFD and 3) Structure. So, having good knowledge in any of these fields is required to be a prospective candidate in Rolls Royce\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s core sector. In addition, one needs to have the relevant software experience, which will definitely be an added advantage. What is your advice on the strategy for preparation? I would suggest to emphasis more on the analytical questions. In the analytical round, the time limit was only 15 minutes, and there were around 20 questions on different graphical interpretations. I found, the analytical round the toughest in the written test. The technical questions were relatively easy. However, those who are already preparing for GRE, I feel, would not face any difficulty to crack the analytical round. But, others might need to prepare separately for it. On the other hand, in the technical interview, the interviewers mostly asked about the projects. Hence, I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think one needs to prepare for that as such. Did you change it depending on which company you were aiming for and in between rounds? No. I had only focused on core and only applied to the core companies. Automatically, when Rolls Royce came, I was quite certain that I would apply for this company. What advice would you like to give your juniors who will be sitting for placements this year? It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s true that non-core companies pay higher (sometimes a lot) than core companies (at least initially). So, if the salary is your major concern, you might get a little disappointed looking to the offered CTC of a core company. Nevertheless, if you are really interested in the core and enjoy exploring and learning in your subject area, you can very well go for a core job. If you stay in a core company, in the long term, relatively larger growth and better prospects (with experience) are assured. Is it advisable to prepare for core and non-core profiles simultaneously? If somebody can do it, then it is the best option. But, because of the courses, the loads that our Kgp-life has, I feel, it is a bit difficult. But again, if one can manage it, this is always advisable. What would you like to say to the general KGP public out there? Any advice for them? I have completed five years in KGP, and have enjoyed a lot throughout my stay. I sincerely believe that KGP is a gift to all of us and we should utilize all its resources to the fullest.

Very early on, since childhood, I was very keen to work in the field of Aerospace Engineering. Sometime during 2nd year, I decided to go for higher studies. So initially, I had applied for placements just as a backup. My inclination towards Aerospace made it very clear that it was just core profiles which I was interested in. During my 9th semester I dropped the idea of applying for higher studies and started looking for placement options apart from CDC as well. However, I was never really interested in the non-core profiles. What was the general interview process (number of rounds, questions asked, topics they questioned about in each round, etc.) for the companies that you aimed for? In Airbus, there were just 2 interview rounds, but prior to that, we had to appear for an online test that was conducted at CIC. In that, there were 3 sections: 1) an English section (similar to GRE), 2) Logical and Reasoning (which had some simple Maths and aptitude questions) and finally 3) profile specific (which were proper technical questions). My profile was Simulation and Modelling. On the basis of our CV and our performance in this test, we were shortlisted for the interview. There were 2 rounds in the interview. The first one was a technical round. In this, the main focus was on technical topics related to my profile. So I was asked some questions on flight mechanics and controls. It was basically whatever we had learned in our depth courses. Apart from that, they asked me some simple puzzles and programming questions. This is because most engineering jobs need you to do some coding. I was asked some questions on Object-Oriented programming and some simple algorithm-based questions. On the basis of my performance in this interview, I had to appear for the next one, i.e. the HR Round. The questions were like, tell us about yourself, why do you want to join this Airbus, what do you see yourself doing in a few years, what do you know about the company, etc. I was also asked to talk a bit about one of my projects. Many of us have heard that one should aim for going into the core sector only when your CG is high. Would you like to comment on that statement? This is actually a safe thing to do. A lot of companies have very little to judge you, so CGPA becomes one of the main criteria. It is advisable to keep your CG above 8 or 8.5, otherwise, things are a bit unsafe. Whereas in Non-core, CG does not matter as much as in core. But that was not so in my case. My CGPA was 7.81 at that time. Most of the people who were shortlisted did not have a high CGPA. So, it varies from company to company and year to year. This year, Airbus probably required somebody who had done certain kinds of projects so that they suit the profile. Moreover, having a high CGPA means that you are very good with your concepts and serious about your work, but it may also indicate an inclination towards higher studies, which could be a red flag sometimes. Thus, they may not go for candidates having a very high CGPA. It is very difficult to predict what will happen next year. So, a very safe thing to do is to keep your CGPA above 8.5. Another thing is, if you are interested in the core field, you should be good at your subjects. And if you are good at your subjects, a low CGPA may not be justified. People often neglect their academics which affects their CGPA. But you should keep a check on it. Any resources you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d like to mention which you used while preparing? Eg- any additionals you took, online courses, etc. I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t use any resources as such. I had prepared my profile for higher studies and core jobs in general. I had done a few good projects (term projects, BTP as well as extracurriculars) which suited my interest in Flight Simulation. Through these, I was able to develop the skills required for such a profile. That is how I made myself suitable. For core profiles you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t need to prepare for placement tests as in case of the non-core profiles. You just need to know your concepts well and brush up the same. What was your strategy for preparation? Did you change it depending on which company you were aiming for and in between rounds? This is a question that does not apply for me very much. I was not very hopeful of being placed on campus, because there were very few core companies for Aerospace, out of which I couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t apply for all. I just applied for whichever profiles suited me and did not prepare for interviews beforehand. Just after I knew I got shortlisted for Airbus, I brushed up a few concepts and prepared myself for the HR Round. It was a very simple process for me. I was shortlisted on the 29th of November and my interview was on 1st December. Between the rounds, I couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really do much as I barely had an hour in between. I just tried to mentally prepare myself for the HR round since the placement process can be quite nerve-racking! What advice would you like to give your juniors who will be sitting for placements this year? If somebody just wants to get placed, some standard things need to be done. You need to know basic programming and prepare yourself for the placement tests (there are standard resources for that). Additionally, you need to practise how to give an interview and how to communicate well in English. However, if you want to get placed in core companies, you need to prepare a good profile, have a decent CGPA and 2\u00e2\u20ac\u201c3 very good projects related to the work you want to do, and you should do them sincerely. Through these projects, you will automatically get the skills you need. These will not only prepare you for core placements but also for applications if you go for higher studies. That said, you should bear in mind that you may not get what you want through campus placements because the options are very limited. A huge majority of the companies that come through CDC are for consultancy, coding, data analytics, etc. Therefore, if you only want a core job, you should also apply off-campus. For the case of Aerospace Engineering, there are written tests for DRDO and ISRO which are conducted by the Government. Is it advisable to prepare for core and non-core jobs simultaneously? Yes, because if somebody wants to do a job later, then, as I said, you can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t depend on Core profiles only. This means you will have to prepare for non-core as well. Moreover, it might be a good idea to prepare for non-core early on, since the skills you develop for technical non-core can also be useful for core profiles (programming and data analytics). What would you like to say to the general KGP public out there? Any advice for them? You should give some time to think about what you specifically want to do in your life. Often, we just try to copy what others are doing. That may not be something that suits you in the long run. If you do give some time, you will find out what you want. Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t do everything blindly.

I grew a tremendous interest in my department when I got into the second year. I learnt data and coding as well but my interest stayed in the core. There were times when seeing the opportunities in non-core subjects tempted me to pursue them but I realized what you want to do is all that matters. And you should keep that in mind. What was the general interview process (number of rounds, questions asked, topics they questioned about in each round, etc.) for the companies that you aimed for? Core companies include Schlumberger, ONGC, Cairn India, and Exxon. I will brief you about all of them. Schlumberger- Didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t come for placement in 2019. The usual process in CV shortlists and Group Discussion followed by Personal Interview. Topics asked are in-depth core knowledge mostly related to seismic and logging. Rigorous HR questions are asked as well. ONGC- Their interview process usually occurs pre-placement time. This year it was on the 29th of November. CV shortlist according to branch rank and category followed by Personal Interviews was the norm. They will either ask questions on seismic or logging. Questions asked to me were related to seismic which includes depth migration, velocities, complex signal, seismic attributes, and deconvolution. Two or three easy HR questions were asked as well. Cairn India- They usually arrive on day 1 but this year they came in Phase 2 of placements session. CV shortlist, Test, and GD followed by PI is the general norm. They focus mostly on previous internships and similar questions are asked. HR questions can get rigorous. Exxon- They arrived on Day 4 of the placement process. The selection criteria is completely based on a test. Questions asked in the test were English this year but they can include basic core questions next year. PI questions asked are based on how you use your core knowledge in real-time. This process is more practical. Many of us have heard that one should aim for going into the core sector only when your CG is high. Would you like to comment on that statement? All of these companies keep CV as a criteria to shortlist and this very much includes CGPA. Once you get shortlisted, the final interview process will test your actual knowledge and that will depend on how you perform. So, maintain a decent CGPA which I would say to be more than 7.5 and in-depth knowledge of the subjects as well. Any resources you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d like to mention which you used while preparing? Eg- any additionals you took, online courses, etc. I personally referred to Yilmaz(Seismic Data processing) and Paul Grover(Well Logging). For seismic you definitely need an external source but for the rest of the subjects, class courses are enough. Apart from that basic knowledge of machine learning and coding will take you a long way. What was your strategy for preparation? Did you change it depending on which company you were aiming for and in between rounds? Thoroughly CV preparation is a must for every candidate. From previous internships to every small detail in your CV should be properly covered. The interview process is totally different for each of the companies as I mentioned before. Accordingly, preparation is required. Reference to previous year questionnaires and talking to seniors who went through the same process helps a lot. What advice would you like to give your juniors who will be sitting for placements this year? Always keep a second option than on-campus placement in one of these core companies. These companies don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have any fixed timeline and some years they skip the whole placement process. Currently, considering the pandemic situation has worsened for our core companies. So, be prepared to handle the stress and learn as much as you can if you are aiming for the core. What would you like to say to the general KGP public out there? Any advice for them? Your personality and your aptitude to deal with situations matters a lot. Alongside soft skills and communication skills helps a lot. Work on these through your years in Kgp. ALSO, DO MAKE A LOT OF FRIENDS.

I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t actually decide upon my profile until I sat for placements. But I knew what I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to do. I wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t very sure about my profile in the start, but I knew that I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to do Data or Coding, and so I cut down all the profiles that didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t suit me and found my natural pool. Accordingly, I started preparing for the Interviews. What were the companies that you were aiming for? I was preparing for three profiles at the beginning of the placement season: Consult, Operations and Core. I had prepared myself only one CV, which was of Core Profile. Although I had a few companies in my mind, I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t target any companies specifically or prepare for them. What was the general interview process for the core companies that you had given interviews for? Initially, for Tata Projects there was a CG shortlist round, where they look for a CGPA of around 7.5 or above. After that, there are basically two rounds that you have to clear- the Technical Round and the HR round. For Tata Projects, in the Technical round, I was asked a very basic Civil Engineering Question: What is known as the pre and post-tensioning of beams? followed by questions on my internships and CV. For the Technical round, you should only have a good knowledge of your departmental courses. I did not have an HR round for Tata Projects, they had only one round. For other companies, there were basic HR questions asking you about your family, about your background, strengths and weaknesses, what you did at KGP and how it has helped and shaped you etc. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve heard that for pursuing core, one requires a very high CG, how far is this true, and how would you like to comment on it? There were many people in my department, who had better CGs than myself, but most of the people in my department chose to get into non-core rather than core, and so, there were few people who were left for core. A lot of people go for further studies as well, so that further reduces the number of applicants for core companies. What were the resources that you had used to prepare for the company? Ex- additional courses, projects etc. It is not that necessary for core, I believe, because they don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really ask a lot of technical questions, but if one wants to do some preparation, they can revise from the GATE Material and go through their notes from all 4 years. That should do for any core profile. If you have a decent CGPA in core, that is all that the companies are looking for. Did you have any involvements at KGP? If yes, how did they help you? I did not hold any PoRs, but I was involved in Inter IIT my whole KGP life. And I believe, my involvement in Inter IIT is what helped me land my third-year intern at Schlumberger. Inter IIT was my strong point and was all that I had. This year people will be sitting for placements as well. So, what will your advice be to your juniors who will be sitting for placements this year? I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve mentioned this earlier too and will mention it again. There are many people who don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know what profile they have to choose until the end. I was stuck in a similar situation. I had tried Data and Coding, and I knew that I wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t interested in that. Most seniors I contacted had advised me to start Data and Coding, but a few of them advised me something which I would definitely like to advise my juniors. Start discarding profiles that you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to work in. Instead of thinking of what you want, you should clearly know what you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to do. And this helped me a lot, I starting discarding profiles that I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to work in and soon, I found a natural pool for myself. There are not many companies for core, and there is not much preparation required for core, so you can always prepare for other profiles like Consult and Operations in my case. Would you like to say something to the general KGP junta out there? And give them a message? I would like to advise people regarding placements itself, one of the most important things during the placement season is to keep your friends close. Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t go alone, take your friends along, because that time there is a lot that is going on in your head, and you need your friends to be there with you. During the placement time, try taking a step backwards and think if you really want to do what you are doing or it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s just due to peer pressure. You will be tempted to take the easy way out like taking up data as everybody does in the last two months. Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t give in to the pressure of placements. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a beautiful process. Go through with it. At KGP, Grab every opportunity that comes your way. And do whatever you choose, be it a society, Inter-IIT or any other, whole-heartedly at KGP. That is what will take you far.

I had computer science in 11th and 12th class, hence I had already done some coding for two years, and after that PDS, so after all that I could code decently. I realized that I did not enjoy it as much as other people. Around that time, in the beginning of second year,we had our departmental courses start, and I realised that I was enjoying studying my departmental courses and that my first impressions of Chemical Engineering were overall positive. I took up a project in my department at the end of my 3rd semester, and by the end of my second year I realized that we have a lot of opportunities in the core field too. Come placement semester, I was more or less certain I could see myself working in this field on a long term basis. Since I was already devoted to core, I did not think that I should go into ML or data analytics. What was the General interview process for the companies that you aim for the number of rounds, questions asked and what were the topics you prepared for? For core, We can divide the basic concepts that we have in our curriculum. For core, heat transfer, fluid mechanics, thermodynamics, mass transfer etc. are pretty elementary courses which we have here in second year as well as third year but these are courses that will continue to be important throughout and are especially important for core internships and placements. Even in the final year placement interviews or vivas, people continue to ask questions from fluid mechanics,heat transfer and Thermodynamics. In my internship interview which I did at ITC, my entire interview was based on questions of heat transfer because it is one of the most integral concepts if you want to work in an industry. In my placement interview my entire interview was based around my project which I did as an intern at ITC and on any one subject of my choice. People should ideally choose these core basic subjects because they are absolutely fundamental and be absolutely thorough with them. As a brownie point, try and research on industrial applications of the concepts you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve learned, which really impresses the interviewers. Many of us have heard that one should aim for going into the core sector only when their CG is high, what is going to be your comment on this. It is not about CGPA in my opinion, but about whether you actually want to pursue a career in the core field, i.e. if you actually like the core field. If you do like your departmental field, you will have a CGPA good enough to sit in a core field. CGPA is an important factor, no doubt. Having a good CG is important. The better the CGPA, the higher are your chances of selection. A CG of above 8.3+ is a safe bet for core placements, but if you have a very high CGPA and a very research oriented profile, companies might think you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll go on for higher studies and not want to take you on and you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll have your work cut out to convince them otherwise. The ideal CGPA range would be 8.3\u00e2\u20ac\u201c9.3. However it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not like if a person has a low CG then there is nothing left. There is a chance in core even if you have a low CG. I know some of my batchmates who got shortlisted and also selected in core companies with a 7.X CGPA Can you please tell in detail about the interview process for Dr. REDDY? Dr. Reddy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s has a shortlisting test in November, which involves a test of core concepts and also some of chemistry (for CH students), a psychometric test and a logical reasoning test. The only preparation you can have is to have a good grasp of basic core concepts. It was also one of my favourite tests of the CDC placement processes. Come December, there is a GD which is very technical and will test you to the very maximum on your core subject competencies. Before the process, it is best to revise all of your subjects because you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be tested on each and every one of them. Following that, there was only one interview round which involves questions on your past internships, projects and some questions on a few core concepts. There were also a few basic HR questions. So any resources you would like to mention which you used for preparing? As far as the test is concerned, I can just say be attentive in classes, do a reading of what you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve studied before the test and keep everything at the back of your head because you cannot really be prepared enough for any test. For the interview I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll suggest, be very strong on your basic concepts and basic courses like fluid mechanics, heat transfer, thermodynamics, mass transfer. Most of the interviews will revolve around that and be extremely thorough with whatever internships or whatever projects you have done, because they will grill you a lot on that. The basic thumb rule in any interview process is, be very well versed with your CV, you should be able to justify every single point that you have on your CV. Another good interview strategy is to go through your CV, and try and predict what questions could be asked from each line of your CV. That way, you generally already have the answers to most of the questions that will be asked, and you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t leave things to chance. And what were your interns? Did you have an intern in your second year in the core field or other? I did not have any internship in my second year, in my third year I had a CDC intern at ITC. Ideally it is better to have an internship at the end of second year, I had an intern but I could not go there because I had some medical problems and I had to give up the intern at that point of time.So I had no option but to brush up on my core concepts. So what were your strategies for your preparations? Did you change it depending on which company you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re aiming for or in between the rounds? No.I mean I did not apply for a lot of companies.I think one of the mistakes that people do is they apply for every company.I was surely selective in what companies I would apply for. I applied for a few Day 1 companies, and the mainly for core companies that were coming from Day 2 onwards. I had a few shortlists on day-2.1 but I decided to skip them because I wanted to give Dr.REDDY\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s interview as if I had been selected for anyone of one of them then I would not have been able to sit for Dr.REDDY\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s. I think it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s important that before the placements you must be clear on what companies you need to prioritize. If there are companies coming slightly later and if you think you have a really good chance of getting in and you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to go to the company which comes earlier,I think you should wait for it, be confident in your preparation and you will get what you want. What were the societies which you were a part of and how did that help you in grooming for the KGP Life? The IIT KGP Quiz Club has been a very important part of my time here in IIT KGP, and I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been the governor of the society for the past academic year. I participated in a number of quizzes all across the country, was a part of the Inter IIT Cultural Contingent for KGP for the past three years, and was the quiz captain in the most recent one. Because of quizzing, I was able to think really well on the spur and keep my composure when forced to think on my feet, which helped a lot in interviews and especially in questions that I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know. I was also a part of spAts and SWG in my early years here and a captain in numerous events at the hall level which helped me in my managerial skills, which is something that companies look for. So what advice do you want to give for the juniors who will be sitting for the placements this year? I would say that be absolutely clear in your own head of what you want to achieve. If you work hard and prepare well, you will definitely get placed. It is most important to not get scared, and not get anxious and depressed if you do not get a day 1 placement, because there are a lot of companies that come later, some with better salary packages too. Not getting a day 1 placement is not the end of the world, prepare well, be confident and give your best, good things will definitely follow. I would also say that ask seniors who have gone through placements for any help you might need, because one thing that I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve learnt in KGP is that your seniors are always there to help you. They have gone through the incredibly stressful time that you would go through in a few months, and will be able to give you incredibly composed advice (I was able to talk with a senior of mine even at 5 AM for help during placements!). Put your best foot forward, and all the best for the upcoming placements semester!

Hi, Halma plc recruits at IIT Kharagpur for their Future Leaders Development Programme consisting of four six-month rotations within the Halma group, with opportunities to work under four different sectors, in various functional areas. Moreover, these projects are typically in different global locations. Could you please describe in brief about the selection process for the company? Firstly, candidates submit their CV on the CDC portal on the ERP based on which there is an initial shortlisting. Post a psychometric test; a questionnaire is floated on the programme\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s website. This is evaluated to release the final shortlist for campus group discussion rounds. These candidates are also allotted buddies who are currently future leaders. Buddies can be contacted for information regarding the program and advice regarding the interviews. The remainder of the process is the Group Discussion, and Personal Interview held on campus. That was a long process for selection. Could you please tell us more about the questionnaire? The questionnaire has questions regarding campus life, critical takeaways from internship experiences and career goals. The questionnaire is different in the sense that you are expected to write answers that reflect who you are as a person. My advice would be to be as open and reflective as possible and leave out the generic answers students generally prepare for HR interviews. Is there any specific process or method that you would recommend for preparing for the GD (Group Discussion)? My Group discussion topic was non-technical (and I think it was that way for all the groups). The topic was open-ended, and the discussion too was such. I do not feel preparation is required for such topics, though mock discussions with peers will help with expressing thoughts well and maintaining a good flow. My advice would be to stay as coherent as possible and work well with your group. Adding analysis to points being discussed and bringing new aspects to the discussion is a plus. So could you talk about how your interview went after getting shortlisted from the GD round? The interview experience was excellent since it was an amicable conversation and not a grilling session that candidates expect. It is more of a fit interview, and I would advise being honest and clear about yourself. The questions tend to be far more personal than the regular placement interview and having some clarity with regards to learnings from experiences in and beyond campus life as well as some serious thought given future goals and ambitions might prove helpful. Thanks Raj for sharing your insights about the GD round. According to you, what is the best way to handle questions related to personal life? Your answers should reflect the kind of person you are, and ideally be supported by evidence from your experiences. For example, internship experiences need not be limited to the technical expertise acquired, but also to the experiences gained outside work hours; campus life need not be limited to projects undertaken or posts held but also your hobbies and extracurriculars and so on. Okay Raj. Did you face anything like a case round or a sort of guesstimate round? There were no case rounds or guesstimates in the entire process. However, practising cases helps in structuring your thoughts and putting them forward in a concise manner, which would benefit candidates in an interview. I was lucky to have a fantastic case group, with super friendly people who helped me through the process and made it a lot of fun. Okay Raj. We have reached the end of the interview. As you have graduated from IIT Kharagpur, are there any fundae that you want to share with your juniors for placement preparation and their life at KGP? Many students do not have clarity on their field of interest or the domain they would like to pursue as their career. Please remember it is alright to be confused. Keep trying different areas; knowing what you do not like is also progress. Nalanda is full of opportunities during the placement process and approaching each opportunity with an open mind helps. Avoiding companies due to pre-conceived notions will only reduce opportunities. I had discussions with my seniors who advised me on company-specific as well as general preparation. The placement process is very tedious but help from my friends. Both batchmates and juniors made it more comfortable and I think this is the crucial ingredient to placements along with preparation. As far as life on campus is concerned, I feel saying yes to opportunities as they come by is very important and will help you grow as a person. It is a great time to explore what you like and should be utilized to the fullest. Time spent overthinking should be gladly diverted and spent enjoying with friends. Cheers!

So we are here to interview him regarding his preparations and strategies to crack the interview of this company. So firstly could you explain to us about your role in the company? Hello everyone. My role at Nestle is a Technical Leadership Program in the field of Food Processing. I will handle manufacturing, and this includes an initial training period followed by leading technical projects related in the various factories across the country. By the end of my 2nd year, I was very clear about my interest and the food processing space and knew that I want to pursue my career in this field. Ok Parush. Now could you brief us about the interview process? There were 3 stages of the interview, the first one was CV shortlisting. Since I was sure what I wanted to pursue, I had built my profile accordingly, which included multiple internships in the food sector across the value chain, and this helped a lot in getting shortlisted for the job. The shortlisted candidates from the Food process engineering specialization of Agricultural and Food Engineering department with profiles which aligned with their job requirements for the Technical Leadership program. The second round was a general group discussion round. The third round was the Personal Interview(PI) round. Ok Parush. Could you tell us about the shortlisting and GD round? The candidates were shortlisted completely on the basis of CV and there were no CGPA criteria. In GD round, from a group of 10- 15 members, 4\u00e2\u20ac\u201c5 members were shortlisted. The topic was very generic and in my case, it was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The rise of the e-commerce industry is impacting the businesses of the retailers\/brick-and-mortar stores.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d Ok Parush. Could you brief us about the PI round? The PI round was classified into 3 broad categories apart from the beginning introductory questions. The first round of questions was from my internships. They delved deeper into the technical details of the work that I did during my internships. The 2nd round of questions was related to the course curriculum. These included courses that were relevant to the food processing sector, such as basics of thermodynamics, fluid mechanics and other departmental food courses. The questions were very basic as they wanted to understand the clarity of concepts. The 3rd round was based on leadership abilities and extra-curricular activities. It was more of a situation-based scenario. Ok Parush. For the core field, is it more important to have in-depth knowledge of each topic or having an overview is fine? In the interview, they asked me about my favourite topics and the interview continued with that topic. So you should have a brief overview of everything that you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve studied and detailed understanding of the topics that you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re comfortable with. Ok Parush. So coming to the PORs, is the no. of PORs more important or the work we have done in the POR is more important? Well both have their own importance. While CV shortlisting, they may consider the number of PORs while in the PI round, things will change and they will be asking about the work you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve done and how it has shaped you. You need to show that you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve driven a significant impact wherever you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve worked. Similarly, in the CV as well, you need to highlight the impact that you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve created while you held the responsibility. Ok Parush. Could you please guide us how an individual can prepare for CAT along with the interview preparation? I was preparing for placement in the core field right from my first year so I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have to go out of my way to work for this. I had been performing well academically, and I made sure that I could grasp whatever knowledge I could during my internships. Coming to the courses, you can revise them a couple of days before the interview. So in the placement semester, I used most of my time and energy for the CAT preparation. Thank you Parush for all the valuable information. We have reached the end of the interview. Is there any message you want to give to the juniors of KGP? Yeah, it will help more if you participate in a lot of activities in your UG curriculum. Explore more in the first year. In the second year, figure out what you want. In 3rd year, you should know what to pursue. By 4th year you should have expertise in that field and find opportunities where your passion lies. While a lot of people sideline academics, I think it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s super important to have a good CG because I think that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s something that will help you wherever you go.

Hello Sajal, Sure go ahead. What was the general interview process for the companies that you interviewed? Please do mention the number of rounds and the nature of the interview process. I only interviewed for one company that is ITC, but I did go through the process for different companies. So I was focusing on companies based on my core field, mechanical engineering, or semi-core, like an FMCG. At ITC they first have a written round, they give you a form with 10\u00e2\u20ac\u201c12 long questions for which they require an answer of 300\u00e2\u20ac\u201c500 words, some of them are related to your internships and all, and the others are related to your background, what you have achieved in your life and along those lines. For example, there was a question asking what is my biggest achievement in life to date and another one asked about mentioning an instance where I put my mind above matter or another one like what have I done to create a social impact and similar thought-provoking questions. And then there was a shortlisting based on your CVs and this form, then we had a psychometric test which I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think had any consequence on the selection because everyone who appeared for the psychometric test also appeared for the group discussion. Then the second round was Group Discussion for which around 60\u00e2\u20ac\u201c70 students were selected. Each group consisted of 6\u00e2\u20ac\u201c7 students. Around 20 people were selected from this round for the personal interview rounds. There were two interview rounds, the first one consisting of mainly technical questions with a mix of HR questions. There were two interviewers out of which one was asking technical questions and the other person asked HR questions. After qualifying from that round there was an interview with senior members from ITC, ie. People who were working in ITC for 25\u00e2\u20ac\u201c30 years and they were there to mostly judge your personality, asking questions from the form that I submitted earlier or some questions judging your personality and traits. Other than ITC, as I mentioned earlier, I also went through the process of placement for Jaguar Land Rover which had a core mechanical profile. They first had a written round with three parts, the technical mechanical part, aptitude reasoning, and a software part. I got shortlisted for the mechanical part but didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t sit for the interview, but as far as I know, there they had a single round of interview, which included the technical as well as HR questions. Would you like to mention any specific technical questions that you were asked in your placement procedure? So, for the personal interview round, the questions were mainly based on your CV. For me, I was asked questions related to my internship as that was the most relevant part for them concerning me having a professional background. So some of the questions that I was asked were, what was the objective, what was the problem statement and how did you solve it, some technical questions based on the work done there, what were the problems you faced during that, what were the different challenges and what did you learn from this internship, how was your relation with your seniors and so on. Other than the internship, I also did a project so they asked me some questions regarding that too like, what was your impact in the project or like what was your contribution to the project that was solely yours and it was essential to the project. The last one was a pretty challenging question as I had to come up with something unique which wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t possible if I wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have been there. I was also asked some questions regarding the position of responsibilities that I held. Apart from this, they asked some questions regarding mechanical engineering as well which were relevant to the industry, like for example, I was asked descriptive questions from a course that we have in mechanical, applied thermo-fluids, which was to develop a heat balance equation for a fryer which is burning from the bottom and we are adding food from the top with oil and other products. That was probably the only core mechanical question that I was asked. As a pre-final year student, what can students do to maximize their chances of a successful placement? According to me, if you are applying to any FMCG or any company that has less to do with the technical stuff than your personality, then you should be focussing on making a CV that reflects you as an all-rounder, a person who has excelled in most of the fields. You have to have a good CGPA, work in different domains, have a good extracurricular record including PORs and stuff like that. Make your CV as dynamic as possible. Apart from that, one should also practice logical reasoning questions, questions dealing with probability and statistics, which will be very helpful in especially in pre-placement tests. So whatever role you are applying for, you should have this part done at least, even if you have not studied probability and statistics, you should at least revise a bit of whatever you have studied in your school. Also, I know this is pretty general but you should have some knowledge of competitive coding is what I have experienced is that even when I was applying for Jaguar Land Rover, they wanted me to have some sort of coding skills as well. Competitive coding is not very relevant to ITC, but many other companies that I have seen require you to have some competitive coding skills, even if they don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have a software profile. Whereas if talking specifically for FMCG, you should have great problem-solving skills and fluent communication skills, because you have to take leadership roles, so whatever you are saying in your CV should reflect a good problem-solving guy and a leader who can lead the team. Someone who has good communication skills and has his points structured. If you are just entering your final year you should put a major focus on improving your communication skills. You should start by increasing communication among your peers, start discussing more points, try to generate new ideas, and start speaking English more. This is a harsh reality that even if you know a lot, have all the technical knowledge but can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t convey it properly or can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t present yourself then you most probably won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be shortlisted from the GD rounds itself and in my opinion, GD is the biggest roadblock for people who lack communication skills, so especially in FMCG you should be dominant in a conversation, you should not let people interrupt you while you are speaking and also you should be convincing enough. I highly recommend that whatever role you are looking for, you should focus on improving your communication skills. Would you like to share any sort of method that you followed or what you did to improve your communication skills and the areas that you mentioned just now? Yes, so, first of all, I would say that you should just start practising. What we used to do was like there were many among us friends preparing for placements and others were looking for internships so we used to sit together to do GD rounds, let everybody speak and then try to help each other out by discussing what were the problems, what things should have been or not have been mentioned, which aspects could be improved upon. We tried to improve each other so that at the end of the day we all can do good in our GD rounds. Apart from that, you should also give many mock interviews. There will be many seniors or even your batchmates who would be willing to help you and even take your interview so that you can have a good habit of speaking well and expressing yourself. So, I could give some major points that you should focus on in an interview. Firstly, whatever your points, qualities or achievement are, try to support it with an example, just don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t come out and say that you are a good problem solver, instead back it up with an example of a situation when you were stuck at something and what was the solution that you gave which was creative, or when you are saying that you have good time management skills support it with something like I was working at this organization, playing sports at the same time managing my studies, or if you are talking about your internship and saying that you produced very good results then try to support them when proper numbers and how you achieved that and so on. Back everything with an example so that you sound more convincing. Secondly, a company is always result-oriented and what they need generally are results, your efforts and all are secondary but what the company would be focusing on from your previous works is what all impact you had in terms of results, so whenever you are presenting your internship or your projects you should describe your work as something that is solution-driven, like by telling them that these results were obtained when I worked on this. When you are talking about a particular internship say that this was the problem statement, these are the things that were required and I delivered these. When you focus on the result, that impacts more, for example, by saying that you increased the revenue of your company by 20% will have a greater impact on your performance. Thirdly, when the interviewers ask you to talk about something, don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t just start answering without giving the answer a thought, pause for a second before answering. Your answer should also follow a proper structure. If your answer is not structured and is not to the point then that reduces the overall impact of your answer, so whenever you are answering before saying something try to make it structural and as much as possible make it point-wise. This was the problem with a lot of my friends, they started speaking before formulating an answer, so you should first think thoroughly, make the answer in points, and then answer. Apart from that, especially in FMCG firms or in any firm that wants you to be dynamic, they want to see you as a good problem solver. Therefore try to mention the instances when you faced different challenges and problems and how did you overcome them, so that they see you as someone who likes solving problems and taking on challenges. This is one of the most important aspects of your personality that they are looking for. These are like the most important points regarding communication skills which you should follow while giving an interview. How did your preparation for technical rounds evolve once you were shortlisted? As I came to know that I was shortlisted in ITC, I started to look for the kind of work that I would have to do at ITC. So I came to know from my seniors that if I get to work in a production line, like in a factory or so, then I would be majorly working on the production part, like if I was in the food segment then I would be working on how I would be applying my mechanical engineering knowledge in food processing, heat generation etc. So my question about the fryer and its heat balance equation was based on that only. So I first found out what are the things that ITC is working on, what are the kind of questions that might be asked from me, then I went on and researched and studied, primarily what I have studied in my curriculum so that I could respond confidently in the interview. I found out that I would also have to work on supply chain management so I got a primary understanding of that part so that if a question arises about what do I know about supply chain then even though it is not there in our curriculum, I can show them that I have a basic understanding of the stuff that I would be working on if I join the company. In my other shortlisted companies which were primarily related to my core Jaguar Land Rover, Airbus or Sony Japan, so in the former, I had to go and study the machine design parts like what are the different designs that are present in a car, what are the different strength parameters and more stuff like this, so asked the seniors from the same company about what questions they were asked and what were the possible questions that can be asked in my interview, then I started by first completing all those topics which were in my curriculum, revised them so that I was completely prepared for that. Also, like for Jaguar Land Rover, I brushed up all of my core related projects and competitions, rehearsed possible questions based on them because there is a high chance some of them will be directly related to their portfolio or at least will be more relevant to them and they will definitely ask questions about anything that is related to their job profile. Similarly, in Sony they were asking for something related to robotics so even for that I had to work on stuff like machine design, etc. I completed the part in around 2\u00e2\u20ac\u201c3 days, revised it thoroughly, and practised some questions to be confident enough. In short, try to find the seniors from the company you are shortlisted for, contact them, if they are from IIT Kgp they will be willing to help you, ask them whatever questions that could be asked and then revise whatever was in your curriculum. The interviewers would understand that this was taught to you and generally they will ask questions related to that only, that will be the best way to go ahead for any technical round. Anything else that you would want to share with the students? Yes, so from the interviews that I faced I understood that the interviewers are primarily looking for a person that is at least confident in himself. Apart from the technical knowledge or the specific field knowledge that you have, whatever you are saying, you should be confident, even if they throw random questions at you. In my second round of interview for ITC, the interviewers were asking some random questions like you are telling me that you did this but how is it relevant and more, so you just need to smile and respond without deterring your confidence level and also back your answer with an example. Like they are trying to judge you in an interview of 45\u00e2\u20ac\u201c60 minutes, so you have to show them confidence in whatever you are saying. Apart from that prepare before, like I have seen many guys who did nothing in 3\u00e2\u20ac\u201c4 years and in just one semester are trying to appear even for software profiles, that is something that I think is very important, that you have enough time. One more thing is that at the placement time, many people get under a lot of stress seeing other people studying more or something like that but at the end of the day when you get placed that stress seems worthless. If you are good you will definitely get placed, you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t need to worry about that. The last thing that I would like to add is that people who are preparing should practice the skills of communicating and generating new ideas, solving problems as these don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t just come without practice. It won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be like you just sit down 2 days before the interview thinking that you would crack it, or you would just do a GD in front of your friends and would be the best person. Try to start such discussions and mock interviews at least 1 month before so that you are confident enough and you can speak whatever you want to fluently. Thank you very much for guiding us Altamash and for giving us your valuable time. Your Welcome Back to list","category":"Placement","profile":"FMCG","department":"Mechanical Engineering"},{"blog_id":37,"blog_text":"Mithilesh Pinjarkar Intern at AB InBev Interviewed By: Secretary We have with us Mr Mithilesh Pinjarkar, to guide us on placement in AB InBev. Could you please elaborate your field of work and job profile? My role at AB InBev is that of a Data Engineer. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be a part of the Logistics Data Strategy Team. I will be working on either Azure or AWS, whatever platform the company has. The work of a Data Engineer lies in between that of a Data Analyst and Data Scientist. So to be a Data Engineer, you will need to know at least one coding language, either Python or Java, some basic statistics and a specific language associated with the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s platform; either Microsoft Azure or AWS. And to learn the Command-Line of Microsoft Azure or AWS, you can always refer to videos available online. This is what is my role in the company as of now. But as an intern in the company, my role was quite different than my role right now. My Intern Role was under the Logistics team and I was to improve the processes at the Mysore Brewery. This role was pretty similar to what is offered to the ITC KITES interns or HUL interns, where you need to go to the factory and they ask you to analyse the whole factory process\/ industrial process and they ask you to improve upon those processes. I was especially working on Warehousing and had to travel from Bangalore to Mysore and back. I had to understand how the warehouse was working, from where the supply was coming, and to where it was going and I had to work on improving a couple of processes there. I had to do ABC Classification of Logistics there, I had to improve upon the counting process of the inventory and I should say it was more sort of a Consultant Role. What are the different companies in this sector one may target? ABInBev is one of the largest FMCG firms in the world, but the roles that they offer in India are slightly different. The point is that the roles offered by ITC and HUL are more like a Field Engineer job. ITC\/HUL sends you down to the manufacturing plant and asks you to manage\/ improve the processes there. But it is not so in the case of AB InBev. AB InBev has three offices in India, all of them in Bangalore. The first two offices are the Capability Centre and the Analytics Centre, which are like the Analytics Hub for all the AB InBev Breweries across the world. So, the data from the breweries of AB InBev all over the world are sent to the Capability Centre and Analytics Centres, where they analyse the data and give insights and inputs to people working in those breweries outside. Apart from this, there is another office works on India Operations. But people who are hired from IITs, mostly end up at either GCC or GAC. Very few people go to the India Operations Office. But, the three of these are corporate offices and do not match to the roles at ITC\/HUL. Therefore, AB InBev does not offer you the role of a Field Engineer during placements, however, during interns, I did get a role of the sort, I being the only one to get this kind of a role because they wanted me to work on Java, and I told them it would take me time to get acquainted with it, and so I ended up taking up this industry project. Also at AB InBev, I choose to take up the job of a Data Engineer because today wherever you go, Data is a necessity. Even if you have a Consulting Role, you will be needing Data as you will be working with company data, and if you aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t willing to work with it, you will not be able to provide them with the right solutions. Also at AB InBev, there is a rule that after every 9\u00e2\u20ac\u201c10 months people are moved across different departments\/verticals. So, AB InBev, for the first two to three years experiments with their people, this is what we have seen during our internship also and even now, people are telling us the same on calls. This is not at all similar to the model that ITC\/HUL follows, that is if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re hired for a particular job, you will be going up the ladder in the same department. But, AB InBev is different. There is promotion also in that scene, but you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be moving across various departments and then when the company feels you are a perfect fit for a particular department, it puts you into that. And this is a very good opportunity because if you get the experience of 2\u00e2\u20ac\u201c3 departments in a matter of 2\u00e2\u20ac\u201c3 years, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the best thing you can get. Even if you want to exit the company, you will have various opportunities and options. But if you speak about the different companies in this league, I would surely count all the Data Analytics\/ Data Engineering companies in the league of ABInBev. However, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d like to add that if you are preparing for ITC\/HUL, you can also prepare for AB InBev, because after all, you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be working for one of the largest FMCGs of the world. What was the general interview process for the companies you interviewed? To be frank, I did not apply for a lot of companies during the internships. And I got a PPO from AB InBev. So, I did not sit for the placements, essentially. During the time of the internship, I remember on Day 1, I applied for 3 companies, which also included ITC and I got rejected from all three of them. There was also Blackbuck\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s GD, after which I was refused. I actually had a third-year intern in ITC, it was off-campus, not a KITES Intern, and I was very specific right from the beginning, that FMCG is a sector that has a lot of opportunities and a lot of scope for growth, and there are a lot of things that you can do and experiment on, also, I won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be working for a startup where the job safety is a little less, but for an established firm. I also was very motivated at the thought that most of the Data Analytics work that happens across the world, the majority of it boils down to these manufacturing plants. So, I was really inspired to work for an FMCG. The first actual interview that I gave was of ABInBev and that I cracked. Please mention the number of rounds and the nature of the interview process. Could you please list down questions you were asked in different rounds of the interview, puzzles, technical questions, any other discussion that you think will prove to be helpful for the students. So, first of all, there was a test, which is there for most companies, but is not typical of FMCGs; FMCGs do CV Shortlisting, after which there is a GD. For ABInBev, there was a test, in which I remember them asking some SQL questions, some Quant and Probability Questions, and some Logical Reasoning Questions. The test wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t that tough, it was fairly easy because as far as I remember, I wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t that prepared and was also morally let down because I hadn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t performed well in Day 1\/ Day 2. If someone is preparing for AB InBev, there is no kind of special preparation required. And the basic understanding of one coding language is more than enough. There were two coding questions, and I was able to solve one of them, the other I wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t able to solve due to lack of time. But when I saw the shortlist list, I could that there was a mix of people who had solved both the questions, who had solved just one question and who had solved no questions. It is because AB InBev also emphasises on one\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CV. And if you have an FMCG intern before AB InBev, that helps a lot. And you have experience with some really big brand; my friend had an intern at Philips; that helps too. The next round was a day after the test. This was the group interview round, which is a mixture of an interview and a group discussion. In this model, a question floats around, for example- what is your biggest weakness? and you need to answer the question one by one. And at the end of this group interview, you face a question that somehow relates to the group, that forces you to make a judgement on that particular group. Like we were asked questions like- if you had to choose one person out of this group to intern with at AB InBev, who would it be and why? And if you had to choose a person who would not do an intern with you at ABInBev, who would it be and why? These questions test a lot of things at once, like how best you can justify yourself and how strong your moral ground is. After this round, we had the interview round. Firstly, people whose CVs were leaning towards Data Analytics were interviewed. My CV had names like L&T and ITC, so it was far away from Analytics, although through my Electrical Courses, I did have some knowledge. My interview was the last one. The interview itself had two parts; they started off with CV grilling, and in my case, they were particularly interested in my ITC intern. What was your project title? How did you obtain your data? How did you use the data? Which platforms did you use? What languages did you use? What were the solutions that you provided for the problems that you identified? What were the metrics that you used to qualify or select solutions for your particular problem? These were some of the questions they asked me. Then they asked a couple of questions that were ethical. Like they asked me- Can you share with us the solutions that you provided here and what were the results you got after using those solutions? I told I can provide you with the solution because that is something that is available online, but after using these solutions the results that I got, that involves a lot of confidential data, so I will not be able to reveal them. They were happy with my answer. During my ITC intern, I had to build a lot of Macros, so they asked me how I built all those Macros. Building a Macro can be just pressing a couple of buttons, but for those who work with VBA and edit Macros, Macro editing is actually difficult. On the same lines, they asked me if I knew how to edit Macros and use VBA and asked me a question about VBA which was easy, and was just to check whether I knew the syntax. After they were done with this ITC grilling, they grilled me on my Placecomm work. After which, there were some HR questions. This was the last round, after which we got our results. What are your views regarding the CDC internship and further placements scenario, in this pandemic period? We all know the scenario this year, that it is going to be tough for the people to get online interns and placements. Usually, people start preparing for CDC Interviews and Discussions, and those-two weeks of December and they neglect off-campus opportunities. However, for this batch, I would like to suggest that they should start their fight for getting off-campus placements this year, and if you have one off-campus offer in your hand, be it placement or intern, it will be very helpful this time because if everything goes South, you will still be having an offer in your hand which you can rely on. This time, the ed-Tech industry will be on a boom, but some other companies might withdraw themselves. So, I would suggest people to parallel-ly prepare for off-campus placements with their CDC preparation, focussing more on off-campus placements. Wishing you all the best!

Bharat, firstly, could you please elaborate on your field of work and job profile. What are the different companies in this sector one may target? Sure! I would first like to make it clear that my job is not of the core profile. My field of work during my internship was operations in Innovation Brewery which is part of the New Capabilities function. And now, after my PPO, I have been offered a role in the Operations function of AB InBev. My job profile is of that of an Analyst in operations. And if you speak about the different companies that one may target in the FMCG sector, I would like to mention that there are a couple of companies that arrive on Day 1 or Day2, like ITC, HUL, P&G. P&G, however, is a new addition and didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t hire for internships during my time. Another set of firms which offer operations roles are different start-ups such as Blackbuck, Oyo and Udaan. What was the general interview process for the companies you interviewed? Please mention the number of rounds and nature of the interview process. AB InBev was the only firm that I gave an interview for, during my internships. AB InBev is open to hiring from all departments, so everyone can write the screening test. After a preliminary test, 50\u00e2\u20ac\u201c60 students were shortlisted and divided into groups of 10, for a group interview round. Now, group interviews are not exactly like group discussions, but more like an interview taken in a group as the name suggests. Everyone was asked about their strengths, their weaknesses and other basic interview questions. Interviewees were also asked to elaborate and discuss the points that they were putting forward. After the group interview, around 10 candidates were shortlisted and interviewed, and out of this, 50\u00e2\u20ac\u201c70% of them were selected for the final offers in 2018\u00e2\u20ac\u201c19 and 2019\u00e2\u20ac\u201c20. They followed the same procedure for placements as well. Basically, this is the standard procedure that AB InBev follows. Firms like P&G also have a very similar process. Could you please list down questions were you asked in the different rounds? Puzzles, technical questions, any other discussion in general that you think will prove to be helpful for students As I mentioned, the group interview round consisted of questions that are usually encountered in an HR round. They also ask some basic questions about the company apart from these. In the final interview round, the set of questions varied from person to person. AB InBev was actually trying to select people on the basis of the projects that they had mentioned in their CV. One of my friends was asked questions only on Data Science because he was aiming for a Data Scientist role. He was asked technical questions purely on Data Science. Another one of my friends was aiming for a more supply chain and logistics oriented job, so he was asked questions based on that. I was more inclined towards innovation and operations, so I was asked questions from that domain. One important thing to notice is that this was possible only because the firm already had projects in all these sectors \u00e2\u20ac\u201d operations, supply chain, data science, DevOps. What was your preparation strategy? Everyone has their own style of preparation. When I was preparing, I focused more on an Analyst type of role, where one should have a clear understanding of the mathematics and the statistics involved. In big firms, the interviewers basically focus on your process of solving the question. Your thinking process matters a lot. And if you want to go for an operations role, everything depends on your CV and you should be able to defend everything that you put on it. This is because operations is not a very technical role. It is mostly about the experiences you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve gained on campus, and how your contributions would help the firm grow. Some internship-related questions that we asked me related to my CV were \u00e2\u20ac\u201d How did you get this particular internship? What exactly did you do in this internship? What are the skill sets that you learned in this particular PoR? and similar questions. What are your views regarding the CDC internship and further placements scenario, in this pandemic period? The Pandemic has definitely affected the firms financially, but they still might come to IIT Kharagpur, due to its tag, although it is true that they might not have as many opportunities for students that they had earlier. The number of offers will probably be lesser due to obvious reasons. But, the students should not lose hope. Be more proficient in communication, because they most probably will have an online interview where it is very important to communicate well. If you are not able to explain your idea to the person on the screen in front of you, then it won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t even matter if you have the best CV out there. So, for this scenario, I would suggest people focus a lot on their soft skills. Try to do mock interviews on video calls and phone calls to get some practice before an actual interview. This will help you understand what kind of pressure you will be facing, or what kind of problems you can face during a video call. Prepare for at least two different types of roles and make a proper CV specific to those roles. Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t underrate the HR round. Also, there is nothing to worry about if your internship stands cancelled for this year, or there is a gap in your CV for summers 2019\u00e2\u20ac\u201c20 because companies do understand that. Do not panic. It is important to contact as many seniors as possible, get your CV reviewed and prepare yourself to anticipate the questions that could be asked.

What are some of the FAQs in most companies that you faced and think students must definitely prepare for? I think one underrated part of the whole process is the HR interview round. During my whole Placecomm tenure, I have seen people underrating\/undervaluing the HR round, which I believe is very misplaced. And sometimes because of this, people end up not getting selected despite performing really well in the technical rounds. In the technical rounds\/test, the company has already seen that you have the required skills, but it still needs to check you on the grounds of your soft skills, your ability to learn and collaborate. Therefore, it is extremely important to give emphasis on your soft skills and work on polishing them. This goes a long way in not just the HR Rounds of the interview, but also the technical rounds, where being able to communicate well and sell yourself creates a good impression. More so, if you are interviewing for an international offer. You also have to frame your answers in such a way that shows that you gel well with the principles and values of the firm. It will definitely be of help to visit the company website and read about their principles and what they look for in their people. Also, a lot of students with high CGPA are asked questions on whether they would like to go for an MS or PhD, i.e, pursue higher studies, and an incredible number of students aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t able to answer this convincingly. Another question that one might face could be on the coherence of what\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s mentioned on the CV. A lot of times students would have done projects in AI-ML, Finance or something unrelated to one another. Such CVs are prone to questions on why they have such varied projects\/internships on their CV and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s going to be helpful to keep an answer ready for that too. Additionally, one must know their CV in and out. You should be able to explain everything that you have put on your CV. What was your preparation strategy? Everyone has their own style of preparation.

Back to list","category":"Placement","profile":"FMCG","department":"Aerospace Engineering"},{"blog_id":39,"blog_text":"Kumar Shubham Placed at P&G Interviewed By: Secretary What was the general interview process (number of rounds, questions asked, timeline, topics they questioned about in each round, etc.) for the companies that you interviewed for? In P&G, the first round of elimination was an online test, which can be divided into two broad categories. The first half included a personality questionnaire which consisted of about 70 to 80 questions. This part was tricky as questions assessing the same personality trait were repeated several times to see if you are answering honestly. The trick is to answer genuinely because P&G is a company which essentially looks for cultural fit more than anything else. The second part of the online test consisted of three rounds, which would assess your memory, speed and aptitude. The first round tested your mathematical aptitude, for example, you were given a mathematical equation with some blanks and you had to fill them. In the second round, they would show you some dots in a specific pattern and you would have to memorize and repeat the sequence later on. The third round was also a memory-based test. I couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t find anything on the internet that would give an idea of how the tests are exactly, but I guess once you start giving the test you will have a much clearer idea about how to go about those questions. It requires basic mental maths, no preparations required as such. This was conducted towards the end of November, after which around 16\u00e2\u20ac\u201c18 people were shortlisted. The next round was a group interview, which happened on day minus one. They interview three people at once, the same question is posed to everyone and their answers are compared with the group. Nothing they ask would be something that goes out of your CV. For example, they asked me to give an instance of me leading a junior team, so you have to take points out of your CV or out of your life to answer the questions. They wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be asking any technical details unless you cite a relevant instance while answering. The bottom line is, they check on your CV while assessing your cultural fit for the company. On the final day of placement, a personal interview was conducted which was quite similar to the previous day group interview, except for the fact that on the final day we were given situations and were asked how we would respond to that situation. For example, the question posed to me was that imagine yourself working on a project for two weeks and being on the verge of making a big breakthrough. The day before your final presentation manager tells you that you can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t work on this project anymore, we have got a new project and you will have to start working on that. How will you respond to that? What\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more important for you, something you have worked on for two weeks or something new that comes on your way? Another question was about me coming up with an innovative cost-cutting solution using cutting edge technology for your company, but the officers you have are resistive about it, how would you go about proposing your solution and convincing them to follow your approach. Now the answers to these types of questions are purely subjective, but it is always a good practice to back up your opinion with profound examples from your work life so that they know that you lead by example and not by words. Moving on, what are things students sitting for placements next year can do from now until December to maximize their chances of getting through a company in this sector? If I talk specifically about companies in this sector, if you have time on your hand you can prepare the core subjects from your department. Speaking for my department you should study Heat transfer, Thermodynamics and Fluid Mechanics. If you have less time on your hand I would suggest you go by the questions that have been asked in the previous years, and then prepare the subjects according to that. While preparing for these topics a student should focus more on the real-life applications of these topics. The interviewers won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t ask for derivations or formulas but how those concepts work in real life. Preparing by explaining to your peers would be the best bet. Apart from that, one should also practice basic aptitude, logical reasoning and data interpretation questions once in a day as they occupy a sizable portion of the initial tests conducted. So, how can students in second-year start preparing for getting a job in the core, how should they build their profile for core jobs? So if you are preparing for core sector, apart from having a strong grip on the subjects you would have to back it up with the internships you have done in the core sectors and to get those internships you would have to have experience on your CV to justify yourself as an asset. So what you can do is to take up a project in the department you are interested in. You should talk to your seniors about your interests and take their inputs while taking up a project under a professor. Gain some expertise and then include that in your resume while applying for internships. As for how a student should go about applying for internships, there is a three-step process that I recommend to people. The first one is to approach your contacts, if you know somebody who is there in a company relevant to your interest, then ask him about the role, send him your resume and see if that works out. The second step is to approach your warm contacts. The warm contacts would include your seniors, the alumni, the mentors that you have, talk to them about the internships they did and if you find that interesting get the contact details and mail your resume to them. The third part would be cold mailing in which you mail to HR of different companies. In short, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s projects, internships and a good CGPA. So CGPA does matter for getting jobs in the core sector? Having a good CGPA never hurts, and of course, having a lower CGPA has its consequences, because most of the companies do keep a CGPA threshold. I believe if you are aiming for the core sector having 8.5+ CGPA is a must. Were you fixated on the Core sector or were you also trying for other fields like consulting and data science? If yes, how did you manage time for preparation between them? Thankfully I had an option where I could go for consulting and I was preparing for that along with my core. As you must be aware that for consulting we have to do case preparations with your peers, so I used to do one or two cases in a day, that would take about 2\u00e2\u20ac\u201c3 hrs for me. The case-solving was something I used to do post-dinner along with solving one CAT Mock paper every day, specifically the LR and DI portion, to ramp up my aptitude and accuracy. In the final year, you have a lot of free periods between the classes, so in these free periods, I used to prepare for the core subjects. One final question, what would you like to say to the general KGP public out there? Any advice for them? I think that the campus offers us a large number of opportunities and there is no set procedure for you to succeed in college life. The only thing that matters according to me is that whatever you do in college do it with all your heart. Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t let the position define you, you define the position you have taken. Try to expand the horizons of whatever is expected from you in a particular role and you will do fine. All the best! Thank you Shubham for your time, I do hope the students at KGP derive motivation from your story. Your Welcome..!! Back to list","category":"Placement","profile":"FMCG","department":"Mechanical Engineering"},{"blog_id":40,"blog_text":"Divya Goel Placed at P&G Interviewed By: Secretary What is the one important thing according to you that helped you get placed at P&G? P&G has a very unique way of carrying out its selection procedure in which it checks if the candidate is fit to work in their culture rather than testing ones technical skills. As a result, having a diverse profile as far as the PORs, internships and projects are concerned and being able to understand the importance of one\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s experiences helps. So, in my case, I feel that having worked in Entrepreneurship Cell until my 2nd year and varied internships & projects were the main reasons behind me getting a job at P&G. Is this true that a high CGPA is required to grab a good placement in the core sector? Yes, a good CGPA is indeed important to get into the core sector. Talking about the chemical core, most of the companies have an internal CGPA cut-off of 8. Although P&G did not have an internal cut-off of 8 (It could be assumed to be 7.5), most other companies do keep it at 8. So I would say that having a CGPA of more than 8 is quite important. What was the general interview process for the companies you interviewed? Please mention the number of rounds and the nature of the interview process. Talking about P&G, the first round was a test which included a psychometric test and basic mathematics & aptitude test. After the test, they selected around 18 to 20 people for the interviews. The first stage was a group interview. In the interview round, they focussed on knowing about the virtues we have rather than asking us about the technical details of our projects. In this round, we were three people who were made to sit together for the interview but we had one-on-one conversations with the panel of interviewers. They asked us questions to know how well aware we are about our own experiences and the qualities we got a chance to work on thereby. The group interview was the most rigorous part of the selection process. After this, we had the last round, the personal interview, which had a pattern similar to the group interview. Can you list down some of the questions you were asked in the different rounds? Puzzles, technical questions, any other discussion in general that you think will prove to be helpful for students. The online test: There were essentially 4 sections. The first part was a personality test to check how well the candidate fits the culture of the company. There were about 70\u00e2\u20ac\u201c80 questions which needed to be attempted with great care. The questions mainly tested honesty and consistency. For example, the 5th and the 60th questions could have been framed differently but essentially mean the same. The answers should be as close as possible, which they would be if answered honestly. The next three parts tested one\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s aptitude. The second part consisted of basic mathematics which was a speed test. The number of questions answered by a student in a given time was tested. The format of all questions was( _ x _ x _ ) + _ = 329 to be answered using digits from 0 to 9 without repeating a digit. The other two parts were also a test for aptitude, memory and speed. The test results and CV was analysed and based on this, students were shortlisted for. Interview rounds: The panel tested the candidate based on majorly two types of questions \u00e2\u20ac\u201d Response to a hypothetical situation; Justifying mentioned capabilities by taking examples of situations handled by the individual Below are the questions (one of each type) that were asked to me- Type 1 You have to complete a project in 48 hours. You had planned to complete it right on time and have been working accordingly. Your boss suddenly asks you to show more results than planned which looks difficult to complete in the given time. How would you deal with this situation? Type 2 Give us an example of how you challenged the status quo and made a decision based on your opinion and experience. No technical questions were asked. It will work well in your favour if you focus your answers on your positions of responsibility, internships, competitions that you have been a part of to make sure that even work that you have done in the past is taken note of. What was your strategy for preparation? Did it change depending on which company you were aiming for and in between the rounds? I had a decent profile in finance which included an internship, a project and being a CFA(Chartered Financial Analyst) Level 1 candidate. Apart from this, I also had an industrial internship at Vedanta Aluminium Limited where my projects were based on the application of machine learning on a core process. So I had a profile which was a mix of finance and bits of machine learning and core. During the placement semester, I tried coding but I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t like it. So, I thought of picking up my finance preparation apart from the regular non-technical preparation. I was preparing majorly for finance and I was shortlisted for Blackrock. When I got to know that I had cleared the test and got shortlisted for P&G, I started preparing for the same as well based on my conversations with people who had already got internships at P&G. Then I appeared for the group interview and cleared it. So I had 2 shortlists for the 1st day out of which I got into P&G before sitting for the BlackRock interview. Any resources you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d like to mention which you used while your preparation? Eg- any additionals you took, online courses, etc. These are the general resources that I used during my placement preparation. Aptitude: For tests, the usual constraint is the time limit. So, solving CAT material (I used TIME Practice books) helps. Geeksforgeeks puzzles, probability and statistics practice from books Heard On The Street, 50 Challenging Problems in Probability (puzzles from these books are usually directly asked in interviews of many Investment Banks) For most interviews, knowing one\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CV in and out is the most important prerequisite. Apart from this, interview preparation is mostly company-specific. What are things students sitting for placements next year can do from now until December to maximize their chances of getting through a company in this sector? The scenario now has changed a lot because of the pandemic. First of all, this year it will be difficult to get placed as compared to the previous years. I would suggest students focus more on competitive coding because most of the companies (about 70 to 80%) ask for coding in their tests. So it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s better if students do competitive coding is essential even if they are inclined towards some other sector if getting a job is their foremost priority as practising coding simply widens the student\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sample space of companies that he can sit for. For the core sector, apart from a good CGPA playing a very important role, it is important to pay attention to the internships\/projects that the students do. In case the next semester happens to be online, seeing the bright side, I feel that students could do remote internships along with the semester as well. Having a core project\/internship on their CV creates a good impact, as well as they, get to learn many things as well. Apart from this, for most chemical core companies the students should revise their core subjects well, like fluid mechanics, heat transfer etc. At last, would you like to say something to the KGP junta out there? Any advice or a general message for them? I included most of the placement related points in the previous questions. Concluding the same, I would just like to say that the placement season essentially tests one\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s patience and stress handling capacity. So, it is very important to remain devoted and consistent with the preparation throughout the semester to minimize the extra stress 1\u00e2\u20ac\u201c2 weeks before the process begins.

Please mention the number of rounds and the nature of the interview process. Well I can answer only about ITC as that was the sole company that I interviewed for during the placement season. ITC first circulates a questionnaire which has around 10\u00e2\u20ac\u201c11 questions related to academic profile, internships, projects, PORs and others are HR questions. Based on the answers we gave and the CV around 50 students were shortlisted which was then followed by a psychometric test, this test tests the cultural fit of a candidate, there are no right or wrong answers here, then we had a Group Discussion round which was followed by 2 rounds of personal interview. The first round of personal interview was more technical and there were a wide range of questions based on core chemical engineering concepts and their real-life applications and also some technical questions from my internships and projects. They almost covered everything that was mentioned in my CV. After clearing the technical round there was the HR round. The technical round is to check the competency of the candidate, and the HR round is to check the compatibility and the cultural fit of the candidate. Could you please list down some of the questions that you were asked in the different rounds, like any technical questions or any other questions that you may think would be helpful for the students? As far as ITC is considered, you should know your CV well. You should be able to answer every question that is asked regarding your projects, internships, POR\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s, extra academics or anything that is mentioned in your CV, and for specifically chemical engineering students I would say that you should brush up on your knowledge of heat transfer, fluid mechanics, mass transfer, a bit of thermodynamics and working of pumps. The questions are not very difficult rather they are based on the practical applications of what we have studied like it could be as simple as asking why does the flow area of water falling out from a tap changes, so you should be able to answer the theory behind any such phenomena. Would you like to mention some Frequently Asked Questions for the HR round, that students must prepare for? So, the questions in HR round are very generic like, tell me about yourself or tell me about your plans. The main funda behind HR round is that you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t beat yourself, be honest, keep a smile, and be confident. These are the main things that one should focus on. They just want to learn about your background, your ability to think on your feet, how you present your view and whether you would be a good cultural fit or not. In my opinion, the best way to prepare for HR round is to recall your past experiences which you think might be relevant and whenever a related question is asked you should be able to tell them such experiences to justify your answers, for example, I was asked if I am capable of putting my mind over matter I simply talked about an instance from my tenure as the Overall Events Coordinator of Spring Fest. So just be thorough with your CV and should be able to justify whatever is in there. How did you prepare for the technical rounds and what tips would you give the final year students to be placed in ITC? For the technical round I have prepared core chemical engineering topics. Apart from that, I have worked on all the technical concepts related to my intern projects. As all of my interns were in core sector so it was obvious that my interview may revolve around it and that helped me. Is there anything else that you would like to share with the students? Well for the final years I wish them All the Best, work smartly and give your best. For others, I will suggest them to take the most out of this great place. You can take different projects, courses, join different societies, fests or cell. Having academic knowledge is good but being part of any society or organisation on the campus will help you grow professionally. Whatever you do just don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t waste time in binge-watching shows or movies because right now you will get many opportunities and time to work on that with zero risks and nothing to lose. So explore yourself, keep yourself busy with productive stuff, and all the Best!

Please mention the number of rounds and the nature of the interview process? I went through the recruitment process of two firms \u00e2\u20ac\u201d BCG and McKinsey. Both of them have slightly different processes. The process for Mckinsey and Dalberg starts with a test unlike that of BCG, post which there is a round of CV Shortlisting in all the consulting firms. This is followed by two sets of interview rounds. The first one is with Project Leaders or Associate Partners in the firm and the second one is usually with Partners. If we talk specifically about McKinsey, they usually release a shortlist of 15 to 20 students based on the CV of the applicants. The shortlisted students have to undergo a test which is a one-of-a-kind animated online simulation game and it is non-eliminatory. This is succeeded by two rounds of interviews in which one would usually interact with 2\u00e2\u20ac\u201c3 different interviewers in each round. Could you please list down questions were you asked in the different rounds? Puzzles, technical questions, any other discussion in general that you think will prove to be helpful for students. Let\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s start with the test. Until last year, McKinsey took a problem-solving test that checked the mental ability and basic math of the applicants, but this year they introduced a game which tests one\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s planning, strategy and time management skills. After that, we had two rounds (or sets) of Interviews. The first set consisted of two interviews with an engagement manager and an associate partner of the firm. The second set consisted of three interviews with partners. Usually, every interview consists of two sections \u00e2\u20ac\u201d Personal experience interview and a Case interview. In a personal experience interview, they try to learn your experiences, understand your personality and whether or not you will fit into the firm. For example, I was asked about any experience I had in conflict resolution, they asked about the challenges I faced in my internships and positions of responsibility, and so forth. In a case interview, they ask you to solve either a case study and\/or a guesstimate. They ask you to solve it with them in a duration of 20 mins (typically) to test your structuring, critical thinking and strategizing skills. What are the things students sitting for placements next year can do from now until December to maximize their chances of getting through a company in this sector? I believe that you should prepare for both the sections of a typical interview that I described before. One is case studies and the other is personality experience. You should work towards developing a profile with \u00e2\u20ac\u0153spikes\u00e2\u20ac\u009d. For the Interview, it typically only takes 40 days of Preparation, so I recommend focusing less on the interview from early on and rather use that time in building a good profile. So, how to get shortlisted? You need to have a good Profile \u00e2\u20ac\u201d PORs, internships, FT if possible, Competitions, Extracurriculars and most importantly, a good CGPA. Chances increase exponentially when it is more than 8 or 8.5. Good Internship further backs it up. If you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have a good internship then try to get a good FT during the break. You can participate in a lot of competitions, which is also a spike to have on your CV. Also, PORs help a lot in articulating answers in the personal experience interview. All being said, you need to have a wholesome profile or something extraordinary in your CV to distinguish yourself from the other applicants. How did your preparation for technical rounds evolve once you were shortlisted? There is not much time between rounds. I tried to keep my calm, not panic and stay confident. I tried to take feedback after every interview and learn from them. Once the shortlists started coming in, I ramped up the pace at which I did mock case interviews with my seniors. There are a lot of checks which interviewers look for - Communication Structuring Personality Mathematics Critical thinking Business Acumen One must ensure that they evaluate themselves on these skills, take good feedback from every mock interview, list down their mistakes after every case and go over them once every day. Anything else that you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d want to share with the students? First of all, be sure about the sector which you want to go to and what you want for your future. Then start by making a good CV and a cover letter. Approach as many seniors as possible and take suggestions on making your CV better. The CV should ideally focus on your strengths and what you want them to know about you. For preparation, the most important thing is having a good case group and Seniors and who can help you. While making a case group, be sure to make it with people who would be blatantly honest with you and share honest feedback, and are as enthusiastic as you. After a while (about 3 weeks of prep), it is good to start solving cases with seniors and other case groups. That will help you understand any mistakes that you are not aware of and in general boost your confidence. Students usually neglect the personal experience interview but please don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t take it casually. Practise for those questions too on a daily basis during your prep. Put forward your thoughts confidently and in a well-structured way. In the end, I would say that this preparation will never be a waste. It is definitely going to help you get better at your interview skills, improve your thought process and your communication. It will definitely go a long way, no matter the outcome.

This is Arnav from Communiqu\u00c3\u00a9. Congratulations on being placed at LEK. If I have your consent may I take a short interview with you? Thank you Arnav! Yeah sure, let\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s have a discussion. Please go ahead. What was the general interview process for the companies you interviewed? Please mention the number of rounds and nature of the interview process. During my CDC internship time I had given interviews for many profiles but for placements, I only have interviews for management consulting companies, so let me just focus on the interview process for the consulting profile. LEK and BCG are the companies in which I had my shortlist. There are other companies too like Dalberg, McKinsey & Company, Arthur D\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Little, etc, that come to campus but my focus was LEK and BCG at that time. So management consultancy is a very niche area wrt to campus placements because there are very few offers from the companies. The selection process includes multiple rounds, most of the rounds being a combination of a case and fit interview. A case is like a general discussion on a certain set of problems with the interviewer and the problems would be specific to a company or a situation. A fit interview includes the HR section, where your personality and your body of work is discussed. Apart from that, you asked \u00e2\u20ac\u02dchow many rounds\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, so that is not very specific as it depends from compa Could you please list down questions were you asked in the different rounds? Puzzles, technical questions, any other discussion in general that you think will prove to be helpful for students. As I have already mentioned to you earlier I was preparing for consulting. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not a technical thing, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s managerial, and we don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have technical questions so there are not any puzzles or any other such things that are asked in the questions but we are asked cases, and cases are containing different problems or different situations; let me list down a few to you. Cases are usually considered of two types one is a guesstimate and the other one is a business situation. Business situations could vary from profitability problems to market entry problems to growth strategies to product launching, to let\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s say mergers and acquisitions to even policymaking, the categories are huge in numbers. Talking about the guesstimates, a few of the questions that I was asked in my interviews were \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Calculate the number of private schools in Mumbai\u00e2\u20ac\u009d, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Estimate the number of birds in Australia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Guess the number of cheques processed in a bank per day\u00e2\u20ac\u009d, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Calculate the total market for steel in Russia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 etc. I think these were t What are the things students sitting for placements next year can do from now until December to maximize their chances of getting through a company in this sector? Like I said there are some major skills required in Consulting 5 of them being teamwork\/leadership skills, academics, entrepreneur activity, research, and analytical ability. So, the pre-final year students must think of their strengths and weaknesses and start taking measures to consolidate their strengths further if they will there is still scope to consolidate them, as I believe no one can excel in all 5 parameters, one needs to consolidate 2\u00e2\u20ac\u201c3 parameters where they find themselves strong. Also, one should try to build certain USPs for themselves if needed. Any external person evaluates you on these factors majorly, as though how good you are at these parameters. Now if you find that you are not good enough in at least 2\u00e2\u20ac\u201c3 areas too then I think you should work upon that area which you find can be improved in a year because consulting requires a great amount of body of work so for them to shortlist you have to be worth it. So for any pre-final year student, you have one year, I would say don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t rest in the How did your preparation for technical rounds evolve once you were shortlisted? Again, we don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have any \u00e2\u20ac\u02dctechnical round\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. First I was shortlisted then there is nothing much changed actually. Let me just be very honest the way it happens in consulting that you have a body of work so you somehow know where you will be shortlisted, in my case I was sure that I would be shortlisted for at least one of the companies. I started preparing before the shortlist. Before the final shortlist the D-day 28th September, I had my notes ready. I only read my notes and didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t practice any cases and just revised the structure which I had done. On that day I was supposed to have 6 interviews and it ended well. Anything else that you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d want to share with the students? For the 1st and 2nd-year students I would like to say is to be true to your work. Explore, work hard, and be true to whatever you are doing, don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t work for the sake of getting PORs just because that will help you with your placements. For the 3rd year students: the students who have already built a good profile should prepare and focus on the areas that they are strong at and improve those, to cover up for any weak spot. The student who doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have a good profile as of now, see 1 year is enough to build your profile as far as consulting is concerned and work hard in whatever you are doing and try bringing in the one impact that is unique for them; then I reckon that things can turn around in a year very well. You should know how to solve cases because it is the case that would make you get through many rounds. Hello Manthan! This is Arnav from Communiqu\u00c3\u00a9. Congratulations on being placed at LEK.

This is Sadhvika from Communiqu\u00c3\u00a9. Congratulations on being placed at McKinsey & Company. Shall we begin our discussion? Thank you Sadhvika! Yeah sure, let\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s have a discussion. Please go ahead. What was the general interview process for the companies you interviewed? Please mention the number of rounds and the nature of the interview process. This placement season I interviewed with two companies one of them was BCG and the other was McKinsey.The process started with CV shortlisting. Both of them required you to submit a one-page CV and this time the submission of cover letters were waived-off. After CV submission, they shortlisted several of us for the further rounds. I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t remember the exact number but I guess the shortlist was about 25\u00e2\u20ac\u201c26 for BCG and for McKinsey it was about 14. After the shortlist there comes the buddy round. For BCG, the buddy round went around for a week, similarly, for McKinsey, it went about for a week and a half. The buddy rounds are supposed to be non-evaluative. I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think they actually were non-evaluative for BCG. But for McKinsey, they were certainly non-evaluative. In the buddy round, you are assigned a buddy from the company itself and you have to practice case interviews and other components of the interviews with these buddies. They help you with sort of a mock interview and give you feedback to improve your preparation for the final day. So after the buddy round which lasts for a week and a half, I did not make it to the next shortlist at BCG, though I received very constructive reviews after the practice cases. For McKinsey, there was a written test which was kind of an online game called \u00e2\u20ac\u0153problem-solving test\u00e2\u20ac\u009d. It was kind of a situational test in the form of a game which was to judge your problem-solving skills. This test was non-eliminative. After this test there were interviews. The interviews were spread across two days, on the first day I had a couple of interviews and the second day I had three interviews with the partners. So that was the whole process. Could you please list down questions were you asked in the different rounds? Puzzles, technical questions, any other discussion in general that you think will prove to be helpful for students. So there are two days for the first day you usually interview with engagement managers or senior associates. On the first day, the interviews were mainly focused on case interviews and there was also a part called personal experience interview which is HR type questions and on the experience listed in your CV. They try to question how your prior experience links to the job you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re applying for and how are you a good fit, They might also ask certain questions which would be completely HR sort of questions like mention a scenario in which you got out of an argument using logic or when you lead a team or that typical kind of HR questions. So after these personal experience interview questions, they jump onto the case. The case is like the usual case interviews that we can find for any consulting company and the time limit for that is about 20 to 25 minutes and the time limit is a bit strict. My role specifically was Business Analyst(McKinsey digital) so this is a new program they opened for the first time to KGP students. This position is aligned with the digital vertical of Mckinsey. So there was a slight part of Data Analytics in my first two interviews, it was not anything too fundamental just simple data interpretation and deriving certain results out of those data by observing patterns. The rest of this interview was the usual case interviews and it went on for about 40\u00e2\u20ac\u201c45 minutes each in total. The interviewers were very friendly and they make sure that you are at ease when you are interviewing with them. So that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s about the first day. On the second day, however, I had to interview with the partners. I had three interviews that day. The first one went about an hour and a half, the second one was about half-an-hour and the third was about for 20 minutes. So in the first interview major part was about personal experience and questions, basically trying to justify your CV and all of the things you have done previously and why do you want to join McKinsey and start a career in consulting. They try to bring out whatever good skills you have. So my experience was majorly in Data Analytics and Natural Language Processing. They tried asking me questions about it and asked me in-depth about projects and in general about this field. So as to just to judge how much dedication I have shown in the work that I did. They just want you to be really good at something. So they try to judge you if you had done what you had done with your utmost effort. Then came the case interview, with the partners the case interview was not the usual one in which you ask questions and they answer and it goes on, in my case they just gave me some information and when I tried to ask more preliminary questions they just told me to work on the information that I had. So they want to check your basic thinking skills and logic and it can be solved with a very fundamental kind of an approach. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s nothing sci-fi that you need to know. They just asked me elementary questions. My questions with partners had some components of Data Analytics for the first two partners and for the third partner it was completely a business strategy case. There was no Data involved in that and they don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t ask the cases as usual ones like the beginning to the end, they just give you a problem statement expect you to explain your way through solving them. With the partners how it went was they gave me some information and asked a very pointed question and you just need to answer the question that they asked and in the process show that your thinking skills are well developed and you can think very logically and you can convey what you think in a very clear manner, that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s what they focused on. They didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t ask me any puzzles in any of my interviews. Solving the case interview was much like a team effort with the interviewer and you both are involved equally. So you need to think out loud about all of your approaches and to run it by him if you are going wrong at any point. They wanted to be really concise and speak only things that really do matter. What are some of the FAQs in most companies that you faced and think students must definitely prepare for? More specifically, in the context of HR rounds. By my personal experience I know that some people prepare generic questions and also you will find some of the generic questions like in HR kind of questions that are asked in consulting interviews in many of the major books. You can think about the pointers as to what you would speak about the thing when the question is posed to you. But I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t specifically prepare any of the answers, I just tried to be truthful in my answers and they can judge you if you are being truthful or you are just giving fundas. You need to justify your motivation to join consulting and why do you think this sort of a career would be for you because it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s kind of a non-usual job. Besides that, you need to show your leadership skills. One of the things I like to suggest is to work on communicating your thoughts clearly. Some people can think very logically but they can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t convey their thoughts clearly. Another thing is to keep smiling because it maintains good air with your interviewer. What are the things students sitting for placements next year can do from now until December to maximize their chances of getting through a company in this sector? I think the usual way for approaching consulting interviews is that you form a case group so the case group is a bunch of people who are interested in appearing for similar interviews as you are and you can practice a bunch of cases, you can observe others solving cases. So in that way you can learn from whatever mistakes they are making, you can replay what mistakes you do and get feedback from others. You can also read some of the books that are present, there are a bunch of good books on the topic you can refer to, you can solve guesstimates and some puzzles, just to get better thinking, to get your thoughts straight in an organised fashion. How did your preparation for technical rounds evolve once you were shortlisted? So I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t do much preparation for consulting interview. After the shortlists were released, I asked for help a few of my peers as well as my seniors who had experience in interviews of such companies. I just did a few cases with them and got their feedback and I used their feedback to improve on whatever mistakes I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been doing. So that was very vital in improving my preparation. Also, the first company which I had appeared for which was BCG. I got very constructive and good feedback from all of the interviews that I gave. I tried to inculcate all of the suggestions they gave to me and improved on my approach. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s basically all that I did. Anything else that you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d want to share with the students? o what I want to share is that I think there isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t something very difficult when it comes to cracking such interviews, all you have to do is to be calm and composed and to organize your thoughts. Some practising with your peers and seniors will surely help but I would suggest not to aim to do all the cases because if you do too much you tend to overthink on usual things and connect them to a certain case that you had done. I would suggest everyone focus on their communication skills as well as solve simple problems and find logic in usual things, just keeping everything first principle. Just go with a clear mind and basic logic. I think that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s enough.

How did you decide that you wanted to go into consulting? I was exploring a lot of fields and had done internships in architecture and design. In the lockdown, when there was a halt of 2\u00e2\u20ac\u201c3 months, I was a little confused about the field to pursue. I did what I liked, applied for graphic design and product design internships and was doing that. In September, I decided to go for product management and consulting since I had a good CGPA and CV, so I began preparing for these two profiles. Did you have any previous internships in this sector? No, I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have any previous internships in this sector, all of my internships were related to architecture and product design. What was the general selection process for the company? Also, the number of rounds and the nature of the interview process? Arthur D. Little was the first company I interviewed for and I got through. They shortlisted around 14 candidates on the basis of their r\u00c3\u00a9sum\u00c3\u00a9, after which we had a buddy-call session, in which they told us about how they will be going about the interviews. Then on Day 1 of Placements, we had our interviews over zoom. There were three rounds of interviews each about 10\u00e2\u20ac\u201c15 minutes long. What were the questions that were asked in interviews and the FAQs if there are any? In the first round they asked my introduction and why did I want to join consulting, Then there was one short business case, which was a small profitability case. It was not a rigorous one, they just asked about the approach and recommendations, I did not have to go through the complete case. The first round went for 10\u00e2\u20ac\u201c15 minutes, and after a gap of 10\u00e2\u20ac\u201c15 minutes, I went for the next round. In the second round, I introduced myself again, in which they stopped me on my leadership qualities, PORs, values and some typical questions like what do you think a leader should do. Other than that, based on my resume, they asked me about my extra-curricular activities and about time management. Also, they asked me to guess my intern company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s revenue and recommendations for its improvement. There was a puzzle, which was a common one, from the book \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcHeard on the Street\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. Then they asked me whether I had any questions for them, and the interviewer was a KGPian too, so we just talked about that. After a few minutes, they called me for the third round, which was with the Managing Partner of India and South East Asia himself. He checked my CGPA and then moved to my extra-curriculars. I told him about my achievements in dramatics and design, as the Inter IIT Dramatics captain, and the Design Head of Spring Fest and Inter IIT Sports Meet. I was also asked about my other shortlists and why I would prefer ADL over those companies. Regarding the FAQs, most consulting interviews have puzzles, guesstimates and business cases. There was no such separate HR round, but all three rounds had a few HR questions to check the culture fit. What are the things students sitting for placements next year can do from now until December to maximise their chances of getting through a company in this sector? For consult specifically, you need a combination of both CG and CV, an 8+ CG is preferable, but you should target for 8.5+, and in terms of POR and Co-Curriculars, they definitely help you in building a vivid CV, which helps in shortlist and even during the interviews, you get more things to talk about. PORs and Co-curricular have a good impact on the interviewer as well, so both of these things are very important. Do you need big names on your CV in terms of internships? Ideally it is good to have an internship at a reputed firm, it is also a strong part of your CV, but in my case, I was more involved in PORs and co-curricular, so for me, I was prompting out my best part, although my internships were not related to this field. But you should have a diverse profile, be it good Internships or good PORs, or both. Please suggest some resources for preparation. I personally didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t prepare much for consult, I was preparing for product management for which I joined Relay Campus which was started by our Alumnus, that helped a lot. Later when I was shortlisted for Arthur D. Little, I had very less time so I asked my batchmates and seniors who had prepared for consult and they made me practice a few cases. The resources which are most important are Victor Cheng YT videos and Audiobook of cases. \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcIIT Bombay\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Case Interviews Cracked\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcHeard on the Street\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 and \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcVault\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Guide to Case Interviews\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 is good for case prep and guesstimates. Difference between consult and product In my crude knowledge, Product management needs you to have knowledge about the customers, their needs and develop features corresponding to the needs aligning with the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s goals. Consult requires you to deal more with strategy, business and management. Product management is an intersection of tech, design and business. Both of these profiles are rigorous in nature. The difference is that as a consultant your clients will be leading companies, NGOs and business managers, people leading the company. While in product roles you will be part of one company and deal with problems for only that company. Both roles, in my opinion, are such that each day is unique and interesting. Any suggestion for second and 3rd years, who are trying different fields and are confused about which to pursue. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s normal not to know what you want to do. You never know what you like, unless you try it. Try something, if you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t like it, try another. My only suggestion is to always be curious about fields and most importantly never do anything just to write it in your resume. Do what you enjoy doing and you will eventually get to know which field is best for you. What happened to me was that I had tried out Architecture, Graphic Design, Product and many other fields. Then I ended up in consulting, after all, these are wide fields that you cannot predict for yourself, but the best thing to do is try out and see for yourself if you like it or not. Aim for something that you like and don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be much pressurised about placements. Why waste precious years of your KGP life, only thinking about getting a job, when there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s so much more to explore and learn from. Juniors can also reach out to me for advice, would love to help. All the best! :) Back to list","category":"Placement","profile":"Consulting","department":"Architecture and Regional Planning"},{"blog_id":46,"blog_text":"Shruti Joshi Placed at JPMorgan Chase & Co. Interviewed By: Secretary What was the general interview process for the companies you interviewed? Please mention the number of rounds and the nature of the interview process. I interviewed for quite a lot of companies which come on Day 1. But, let\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s just focus on JPMorgan, since this was the company I was essentially aiming and preparing for. Talking about the process, it started with C.V. submission on E.R.P. and also on the website of the company. It was followed by a pre-placement talk, which was very informative and quite insightful about the profile and expectations from the student. After that came the Psychometric test, which was non-eliminatory. It was succeeded by a written test, which was all about writing an essay on a financial topic. Based on this test and our CV, a shortlist of about 20\u00e2\u20ac\u201c30 students was released for the final interview process. On the final day, there were two interview rounds, both of which were essentially technical. Could you please list down questions were you asked in the different rounds? Puzzles, HR questions, any other discussion in general that you think will prove to be helpful for students. Starting with the written test, as I mentioned earlier, we had to write an essay on a topic related to finance. The time limit for about 30\u00e2\u20ac\u201c40 minutes and a word limit of 500 words was laid. Before the test, I practised writing essays on some general financial topics with a time constraint, which helped me later. Talking about the interview process, there were two rounds of interviews of about 30 minutes each. First-round was completely technical, where questions related to corporate finance were asked. I was asked a few questions based on macroeconomic factors and their influence on the market, such as inflation because I had worked on these factors during my CDC internship. Then came the second round, which was a mix of HR and Technical questions. Again, the major focus was on corporate finance and macroeconomics. As a pre-final year student, what can students do to maximize their chances? Please suggest some strategies or resources for the same. At this stage, I would suggest them to start reading about the markets via newspapers, podcasts, etc. I read Finshots and Zappchai because these are relatively easier to understand. Later, I started reading a few newspapers. All these helped me strike a good conversation with the interviewer. Apart from that, I want all pre-final year students to practice quant and quick math, which would be helpful in all the profiles. CAT papers and Quantitative Analysis for CAT by Arun Sharma, are always good for quant, while quick math is all about practice. If you are particularly aiming for this role, ensure to brush up on your corporate finance. Make sure you can justify everything that is mentioned in your C.V., as it is very important. During the last week of your preparation, have mock interviews with your seniors or friends about the companies you are aiming for. It is better to have an idea of how an interview works, than actually sitting in front of the interviewer for the first time. What do you think about the weight a certification like CFA or FRM adds to a CV for this role? I did not have either CFA or an FRM certificate, so it is not mandatory to have either of them. The final outcome depends on the interview. Having cleared the CFA level 1 or higher would give you a good knowledge of corporate finance, which ultimately helps in the interview. But having these certifications indicates that one has a good hold over these topics. That might also bring more complex questions your way. In the end, it all depends on how well you can defend what you have on your C.V. Shruti, How did you prepare for the rounds involved once you were shortlisted? The shortlist was announced in the last week of November, which left me with 2\u00e2\u20ac\u201c3 days to prepare. So, once I was shortlisted, I brushed up on my knowledge and revised the topics of finance. I took the suggestion from my seniors who previously prepared for the same profile and prepared accordingly. I also had a few mock interviews with them, which provided me with an idea of how the final exam would be. My actual interview was quite aligned with those mock interviews. Anything else that you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d want to share with the students? I would suggest them to start with prioritizing the companies and profiles they are aiming for. Then, start talking to the seniors about how to start preparing for particular companies and their interviews. At the same time, stay in constant touch with your peers who are aiming for the same profile. Try to help and motivate each other. Talking about the interview phase, it is necessary to know that it is not compulsory to answer every question throughout the interview. Sometimes, I had to say that, \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcI\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not aware of this topic\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 or \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcI\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not sure about the answer.\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Remember to stay calm, even if you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know something. Do not panic. Apart from this, I would also suggest being more interactive with the interviewer. Try to have a conversation, rather than a question and answer session. It would help in making the interview interesting.

I am Raza Khan, Secretary at Communiqu\u00c3\u00a9 IIT Kharagpur. And I wish to interview you for the blog series, related to placements in finance profile. Can we start with your introduction? Sure! Hii Raza, good to know about your initiative. Communiqu\u00c3\u00a9 is doing a great job in this regard. Regarding myself, I am Piyush Agrawal, currently a 5th-year student pursuing Economics at IIT Kharagpur. I recently got a full-time offer from KPMG for an Associate Consultant position in the Financial Risk Management profile. Piyush, can you brief me about the role which you have been assigned in the Company? Sure, this is an excellent question because the role that KPMG came for this year was quite different from the ones that visited our campus earlier. They usually offer management consulting and analyst(Finance) roles. But this is a client-facing job in the domain of Financial Risk Management, similar to the risk profiles of Nomura and JPMC but the latter are more of an analyst role that is not front-facing. I think this is unique about the profile as it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not restricted to analysing and modelling alone but also involves client interaction. And, I hope that sums up the role. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s quite a diverse profile to work on. Can you share some insights about the recruitment process and general advice which will prove helpful to the aspirants for this profile? First of all, there was a subjective screening test, with questions focused on Quantitative Aptitude. For this, hands-on at solving Prob-Stats and Econometric Analysis questions will be helpful. Post getting shortlisted, they took three rounds of interviews. One was the HR round, where they asked general questions like Strengths Weaknesses, Why KPMG? Why you?. The other was a technical round where I was grilled on Econometric Analysis, Derivatives and understanding of the Banking system. After clearing these rounds, we had a Partner Round. It moved around judging my personality, my familiarity with Finance jargons, and how I can deal with some practical situations like handling pressure and dealing with clients. Apart from that, I have seen candidates getting rejected because they were unable to explain their CV or don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know about the role. So, I would suggest refrain from these common mistakes for the interview and prepare accordingly. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s quite a robust answer. Now, how can a pre-final year student maximize their chances and what resources and suggestion you want to give to them? I was also in the same position a year before, where I was going through the resources and suggestions to get a grasp and move forward. First of all, try and decide the profile you want to go for or have a priority order of profiles in your mind. I realised students usually try their hand in multiple fields end up having a lot on their plate, during placement preparation. But it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s essential to prioritise and take a call ASAP, which will give you a direction you want to head-on. Secondly, try to figure out and don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t forget your USP(Unique Selling Proposition). For example, I come from an Economics background, which gave me an upper hand in finance-related fields. Similarly, you may have done some internships, projects, courses or involved in extra-curricular activities, which definitely may have improved you & created the potential to get an edge in a particular domain. Apart from that, the resources are almost known to all. However, I would suggest reaching out to seniors who are currently working in your target companies and take suggestions on preparing for the interviews. What do you think about the weightage that certifications like CFA and FRM add to this role? No doubt, these certifications play a positive role in getting you a job as it gives a sense to the industry that you are equipped with a certain amount of knowledge. Also, the job description of companies recruiting in the finance field generally includes that having a CFA or FRM certification would be a plus. Still, I would suggest discussing with your seniors before doing any Certifications. Can you suggest any Courses in Kharagpur or online MOOCs which can help in the preparation for this profile? Concerned to this Profile, as the test and interview moved around Quantitative Finance. So, courses like Probability and Statistics, Regression and Time Series Model from the Mathematics department and understanding of basic finance through online MOOCs or subjects offered by VGSoM and HSS department would be helpful. If someone wants advanced knowledge of finance, they can opt for derivatives and financial risk management subjects. You took multiple PoRs over the years, how did they help you during the Placements? First of all, I feel lucky for being a part of various Extra-Curricular activities on campus. On the front of holding PORs, I was Secretary Hockey, became General Secretary, and then Overall Coordinator of Inter-IIT 2019. Also, I remained a part of GYWS and BClub. Overall I can say that these engagements helped me in shaping my Personality. I can recollect my Partner Round (at KPMG), where there were situational questions that I felt confident to answer due to the experience I had being at crucial PORs. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not that when you hold multiple PoRs, you will surely get a good opportunity at the Placements. People should not blindly take PoRs because they think they can in-cash them during placement. Instead, this is an opportunity to positively impact and simultaneously gain some important soft-skills like negotiation, problem solving and teamwork. PoRs aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t meant to give a job, but they will provide you with an experience with your peers, which can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be substituted. Yeah now we are at the end of the interview, anything else you want to share with your juniors? I would like to say that online semesters would have given you a taste of how vital peer support is. So if you are stuck somewhere, just seek help. We are part of a 7-decades old institution, and yet you believe your problems or situation are so unique that not one of those alums\/ seniors\/ juniors\/ profs has ever faced it? Reach out to them and talk your heart out. Also, be proactive and don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be limited to yourself. Participate in competitions, network, travel, create something new or unique and take out some time for your body & yourself. Please bear in mind that this is not the end of the world. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a whole wide world apart from this. So yeah, Enjoy & keep progressing! Interviewer: Yeah that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a very nice suggestion for juniors. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m am sure students pursuing the same will be benefited from your advice. Now we are ending the interview, thank you for your time, Piyush.

This is Charvi from Communiqu\u00c3\u00a9. Congratulations on being placed at Blackrock. Shall we begin? Thankyou, Charvi! Yes, go ahead. So my first question is, what is the general interview process for the companies you interviewed? Please mention the number of rounds and the nature of the interview process. On the first day, I had given interviews with four companies. For Blackrock, they shortlisted students based upon their CV on the day before the interview. In the interview, they had three rounds. If a candidate qualifies for all the rounds, they have to sit for HR rounds, which lasts for around 20\u00e2\u20ac\u201c25 minutes. It was more of a personality test. They asked me questions from my CV, my PORs, and my extra-academic activities, mainly NSS. Some situation-based questions were also asked. Could you please list down questions you were asked in the different rounds? Puzzles, HR questions, any other discussion in general that you think will prove to be helpful for students. First: they were checking the candidate\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s coding skills based on the language they had mentioned in their CV. I had mentioned R and Python in my CV, but they asked me to choose one, so I decided to go with R. He asked me about libraries and functions in R. He asked for function names and steps to carry out a particular task. Then he asked me about functions that have very minimal differences like left join, right join, inner join and outer join, etc. Second: The interviewer asked me CV-based questions (mainly internships and projects). Being from a financial engineering background, he asked me questions from finance like \u00e2\u20ac\u0153what is bond valuation and how to do that? What are the variables used? What is the yield curve? Some questions were from corporate finance and derivatives. They also asked me questions based on my CV, as I had done two interns and many projects, so questions were asked regarding the same. Third: The interviewer asked me a guesstimate. The question was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153to estimate the number of iPhone currently present in India.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d He didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t ask for a number but asked me to explain my approach to solve the question like \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcHow would you start and what separations would you make,\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcwhat factors the buyer considers before buying the iPhone.\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 As a pre-final year student, what can students do to maximize their chances? Please suggest some strategies or resources for the same. For pre-final year students, I would suggest that they should, first of all, decide in which profile they want to get into and talk to seniors about their interested fields who are already placed in that profile because that would give them a good idea like what are the things they need to know and skills they need to gain before placements, so that would be very helpful. Then, prepare a good resume, keeping it neat and clean, mentioning all the things, take help from seniors, and get it reviewed by them. I would tell you that while I was interviewed by IARC, the interviewer said that my CV was neat and clean, which was a plus point for me. So maintain a good CV. If you are sitting for a software profile, then you just need to be good at your coding skills, but if you are sitting for an Analyst profile, then in tests, questions would be based on quant, Logical Reasoning\/Data Interpretation(LR\/DI), ML, English. So you need to be good at all these skills. If you are good at your logical reasoning skills, then I would say you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t need much practice, and if not, you need to practice from some online resources like the website \u00e2\u20ac\u0153IndiaBIX\u00e2\u20ac\u009d which would be very helpful in the test. Apart from that, If your English is not that good, then you have to improve that. After all, they have a section of English in the test, so try to improve before the placement if required and prepare for guesstimates from a book like a case interview because guesstimates would be asked in the interviews for analyst profiles. For practising probability questions for the interviews and tests, you have \u00e2\u20ac\u015350 challenging problems in probability\u00e2\u20ac\u009d and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Heard on the Street,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d these books are excellent sources. Many times you just get direct questions from these books or questions based on similar patterns in companies like GS, JPMC, etc. For puzzles, geeks for geeks is one of the best sources. For normal quant practice, Arun Sharma or any other CAT book would suffice. What do you think about the weight a certification like CFA or FRM adds to a CV for this role? So here I would say that I am not the right person to answer this question because I have never prepared or even appeared in these examinations. Therefore I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think I can comment on this, but in general, how much I know is that these help you build a robust finance profile and add value to your CV. In my case, I would say that my being from financial engineering helped some way or the other in the placements. How did you prepare for the rounds involved once you were shortlisted? On day one, I was shortlisted for five companies. The first shortlist I got was on 27th or 28th November, So there is a group called inter IIT placement where interview questions are shared by all IIT students and NIT students. You would get interview questions for all companies, and if the interview and test questions are updated, you would have an idea of which company is asking which type of questions. You will not be sure that you will be asked that same question, but you will surely get an idea about the kind of questions asked in the interview rounds. Also, for preparing for the HR round, I had prepared for typical HR round questions because if you are doing well in technical rounds and do not speak well during the HR round, then that may create a problem, So what you need to do is that search for HR questions on any website, there are so many websites, go to any website. You can see some basic questions like where do you see yourself in the next five years? Now next thing to do is to prepare a model answer for these types of questions. One more thing attending presentations would also help know about the company for which you have got shortlisted, along with this visit the website and see what work the company does, where the revenue comes from and all such basic things. If you think that you are going to get shortlisted for a particular company or you want to go for that company, then attending the presentation session will be very helpful. Every company more or less organizes this session. I prepared my CV thoroughly before the interviews. Anything else that you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d want to share with the students? I would say just one last thing that analyze yourself like How much you know and what skills you already have and how much extra work and efforts you need to put, accordingly preparing a schedule like how much time you need to give daily to get that skills and identify resources for that. Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t go here and there as someone said prepare from that source then you are going to that, and then someone else said something, and you again change, so pre-decide what are the sources you are going to refer to and check whether these sources are actually helping you in getting the skill and answering the questions that would be asked in the test. Also, do not fake yourself in front of the interviewer. Have faith in yourself, and don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get stressed. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s all from my side.

Please mention the number of rounds and the nature of the interview process. For placements, I had been aiming for all the finance roles. On Day 1, I was shortlisted for 4 companies i.e. IARC, BlackRock, Arpwood Capital, and Nomura. IARC is an asset reconstruction company and it is a subsidiary of Blackstone, which was my first preference. The profile for it was of an investment analyst. There were 5 rounds of interviews. 4 rounds were based on finance and the 5th was related to HR. BlackRock had 2 rounds; 1 technical and then HR. I got an offer from Blackrock and IARC, so I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t sit for the other two companies. IARC and Arpwood Capital had a test-based shortlist. The test consisted of questions based on logical reasoning, puzzles, basic English, and data interpretation. Blackrock\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shortlist was based on your CV. Nomura had theoretical math (MATH-1 & MATH-2) based test for the shortlisting. Could you please list down questions you were asked in the different rounds? Puzzles, HR questions, any other discussion in general that you think will prove to be helpful for students. Basically, 4 types of questions are asked in all finance profiles. Firstly, the CV-based questions, which are quite common but important. One must be able to explain every point mentioned in his\/her CV. You should prepare an answer to \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcWalk me through your CV, as it will be asked in almost every interview. Your answer should connect everything on your CV and explain why you did it. It is also better to have some previous experience in finance because it gives the interviewer some talking points. Then come the puzzles, guesstimates, and financial cases. Puzzles are mostly asked from books like Xingfeng Zhou and Heard on the Street. Puzzles based on expected probability are asked very often. Solving them is a must. Finance cases, which were asked in the IARC interviews, were mostly based on the factors on which investment in a company depends upon, both financial and strategic as well as relevant ratios and macroeconomic factors. Basic guesstimates are also asked. For example, I was asked to estimate the number of ATMs in my hometown in an interview for IARC. Thirdly, the basic finance questions cover all the fundamental topics such as beta, WACC, bonds, valuation, ratios, and their interpretation, basic accounting, etc. Coming to the HR rounds, there are some generic questions like, \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcWhy finance after engineering?\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcWhat have you done to follow your interest in Finance\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 etc. One must have a solid answer prepared to these questions as they will be asked almost everywhere. Apart from all this, BlackRock\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s profile consists of a mix of financial analysis and modelling, etc. and so I was asked a bunch of python-based questions in its interview. So, a basic idea of coding in python or any other language is required. As a pre-final year student, what can students do to maximize their chances? Please suggest some strategies or resources for the same. The best thing one can do to get into finance is, to build a good CV. This field is a bit challenging as there are only a few good companies in number as compared to Software. Also, their shortlists are very small. For IARC, there were only 9 students. Coming to BlackRock and Nomura, there were about 25\u00e2\u20ac\u201c30. Thus your CV should be good enough to get shortlisted in companies like these because even if there is a test, CVs are also often taken into account on top of the test score. There are 3 major factors that companies consider: CG, interns, and projects. Projects in finance can be taken under Professors of VGSOM, IIM, etc. Interns are the most helpful as they provide you with actual experience. CG is also important and it is paid more importance than PORs and Extracurricular Activities. Financial Engineering courses can help in financial prep. Courses from Coursera can be taken for basic knowledge. Mergers and Inquisitions is a good youtube channel to learn about various terms and valuation techniques. Zerodha Varsity modules are a good source for an introduction to trading. Also, you can subscribe to Finshots and Investopedia- word of the day to learn more each day. You can also go through CFA and FRM books to learn more, they are freely available. Books like Hull and The Intelligent Investor are also good. What do you think about the weight a certification like CFA or FRM adds to a CV for this role? They are not completely necessary, to be honest. I have neither of them. Sources to study Finance are barely available on campus, except for VGSOM. To get a broad overview and study in a structured manner, one can definitely study the material for CFA and FRM. The certification can help you get some talking points in the interviews. The interviewer may ask questions that are directly picked from the syllabus of these if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve done them. They also serve as proof of your knowledge. If one has to choose between the two, I would prefer CFA to FRM, because it gives a broader view of finance. How did you prepare for the rounds involved once you were shortlisted? There is not much time between the shortlist and the interviews. The shortlist for Nomura was announced just 24 hrs prior to the interview. The preparation for all these companies is more or less the same. One must start revising the basic concepts, financial ratios, and their interpretations and start solving books for puzzles about 1\u00e2\u20ac\u201c1.5 months before the interview. In the time between the shortlist and the interview, revision can be done. You can practice some guesstimates with your friends who have prepared for consulting or you can refer to \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcCase interviews cracked\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 youtube videos or the IIT B case book. Anything else that you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d want to share with the students? I have noticed that people don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t invest much time in making a CV, which later hurts. Students should draft their CV and can get it reviewed by seniors placed in similar fields. The CV must be aesthetic and crisp. One must be able to justify the points in their CV in-depth and you should avoid lying. Apart from its importance in shortlisting, most of the interviews are based on your CV so it is integral. Also maintain a good CG, A CG above 8.5 would be very comfortable, above 8 is still fine but below 7.5 will affect the probability to get shortlisted.

This is Charvi from Communiqu\u00c3\u00a9. Congratulations on being placed at Morgan Stanley. I will be asking you a few questions about Communiqu\u00c3\u00a9\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s initiative CQ_Finforte, so shall we start? Thank you, Charvi! Yeah sure, please go ahead. What was the general interview process for the companies you interviewed? Please mention the shortlisting process for the same. For day 1, I was shortlisted in 3 companies: Morgan Stanley, IARC (International Asset Reconstruction Company) and Blackrock. Morgan Stanley was my 1st priority. And, by the time I interviewed for MS and IARC, I had received an informal confirmation from MS. So, naturally, I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t appear for Blackrock. Now, both MS and IARC follow a similar scheme of recruitment: AMCAT (an aptitude test) score & CV based shortlisting followed by 4 rounds of Interviews. The AMCAT is essentially a watered-down version of CAT (i.e. quantitative, logical reasoning, data sufficiency etc.). The only difference is that while AMCAT is relatively easier compared to CAT, it has a much stricter time-bound. For instance, there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not only a section-wise time-bound but also no flexibility of switching over questions even in the same section, i.e. you need to attempt a question to move to the next one & you cannot navigate back once you attempt it and move on. That is how they implicitly ensure that you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t give a lot of time to a single question. Having said that, preparation is quite straightforward. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an ample amount of sample AMCAT videos on youtube (and quite representative, to be honest!). Both MS and IARC had an AMCAT, but MS also had some 3\u00e2\u20ac\u201c4 additional sections. These were basic accounting (requires 2\u00e2\u20ac\u201c3 weeks worth of knowledge of financial statements, revenue recognition etc.), listening, reading and speaking (you have to read out phrases shown on the screen, you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be given a topic on the spot and 30secs to prepare for it and speak over a minute etc.) Can you please mention the number of rounds you had while interviewing for these companies? Please mention the nature of the rounds. Coming to the interviews, let\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s discuss one by one. MS had 3 technical rounds + 1 HR round. Across the 3 technical rounds, you meet with people with varied seniority ranging from 5 yrs. to 10 yrs. of experience. Usually, 1 or 2 of them are KGP alumni. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the way the cookie crumbles! The HR round happens at the last and only if you clear all the technical rounds. IARC had 4 rounds (and each round was a mix of both technical and HR). So you have four partners of different seniority in IARC, and each of them will interview you. In technical rounds, usually, you have people. For both MS and IARC, each round can last from 15\u00e2\u20ac\u201c20 mins. Can you please mention a brief idea of how to answer the questions based on our internships and projects that we have done? I gave eight interviews that day, 4 for Morgan Stanley and 4 for IARC, and they always begin with the introduction. The first minute or two goes with the introduction, and then in the process, you may be asked to briefly go through your CV or some specific project\/internship which piques the interviewer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s interest. Remember that the interviewer usually doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have any great idea about what you did or why you did what you did. So, they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re looking forward to understanding exactly that. People usually make 2 mistakes here. First, they don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t practise\/prepare for it upfront. They sort of feel that, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153After all, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s my work. I can definitely explain it. What\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the big deal\u00e2\u20ac\u009d. Second, they often give too much emphasis on a very small detail of their project just because that was the most \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcdifficult\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 part for them while working on the intern\/project. Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t make these very common mistakes. Do rehearse each project\/intern mentioned in your CV and don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get lost in explaining the very nitty-gritty details of your work unless they specifically ask about it. I used a basic mental structure to whip each of my interns\/projects: \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcWhat was the broader objective of the project?\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcWhat was the solution\/technique used by me?\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcWhat was its performance?\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 (e.g. saved costs, increased accuracy, saved time by automation, increased user engagement etc.) E.g. In one of my interns at a global bank, my job was to forecast an economic indicator in Australia. So, I should be able to tell the interviewer that why on earth does the bank want to do that (objective) \u00e2\u20ac\u201d bank wants to do it because when they are giving out loans, they need to know how risky the loan is, and for that, they need to project or forecast certain variables, accordingly they will be able to keep some capital or cushion aside. Then, I would tell him that I used (technique) VAR or ARIMAX or LSTM etc. And, that VAR performed much better for [so and so reasons] than ARIMAX and LSTM by [this much]. In fact, they used my model for in-house forecasting purposes for the next quarter projections. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s it! You don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t need to push him into the math of VAR or the R libraries that you had to use to do it. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s only when he asks you about it that you go in deeper. Moral of the story: Break every intern\/project into 3 things: Objective, technique and performance. Will you please mention the type of questions and puzzles asked in all the three technical interview rounds of Morgan Stanley? Now, coming to the questions that were asked. It was probability puzzles, valuation and basic finance (like time value of money, annuity etc.). There was a probability question, with a follow up to the Monty Hall problem. There were three doors, one of them had the prize, and I was asked to choose one door among the three, and I chose B. He opened one among A and C and told me that I still want to go with B or you want to switch. I said yes, Sir, I will switch, because the probability of winning is \u00e2\u2026\u201d. He asked what mistake did the game host make (which made my winning probability increase on switching)?. Hence, the answer to this question was, Because he is purposely choosing the gate which does not have the gift, he is giving away information by consistently not trying to give away information! In that particular round, he asked how much finance do you know? Not a serious question, and if you say I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t remember much finance, then they will say \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcwhy have you chosen this role\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 (sales and trading). I said I know \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcabove average\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, because I have done CFA Level 1, had a couple of certifications and also done an internship in finance. Then finally, at the end of the round, the interviewer asked if you have any questions for me. I asked him to explain the role (a very safe, straightforward question). This was the first technical round. Then the second technical round again started with an introduction. Then again, a probability question was asked on a dice, jee level problem. One of the questions asked to my friend was based on geometry, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153if the triangle is a right-angle triangle, you know the three sides of it tell me the altitude dropping on the longest side?\u00e2\u20ac\u009d We just had to equate the area! Then came a really interesting question, where he asked me, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153where do you live?\u00e2\u20ac\u009d I said West Bengal. He then asked,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d Pick up one of your favourite buildings in West Bengal\u00e2\u20ac\u009d I picked the British Embassy, a nice library. They said, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Value that building.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d Now, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a question of valuation of real estate, from a finance perspective you should be able to tell them the first hint of it, that it has to be a DCF valuation, I asked him what is the purpose for which I want to buy it? Is it for living purpose or for commercial purpose?, so he said for commercial purpose (an approach: keep asking follow-up questions he may answer but may or may not give you concrete data\/numbers), he is expecting to see how many relevant questions we can ask, so I continued with it and gave a proper answer, By this time the technical part of the round was over, then he asked,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d I see you have done two minors, so do you know when the minor programmes started?\u00e2\u20ac\u009d. For him, it was a nostalgic moment because the time when he entered college was when the minor first began, I said, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153No sir, I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t remember\u00e2\u20ac\u009d. In such situations, you just pick up some conversation and go along. You need to be someone who can maintain the conversation, both technical and non-technical, without losing your professionalism. Morgan Stanley was looking for the profile where you have to talk to people up and down across the continent. Then comes the third technical round, Once again, I was asked for an introduction, and then he started with the question: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Why do you want to go into finance?\u00e2\u20ac\u009d. Then he asked me, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I see you have done CFA,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d so he asked me which subject is your favourite. I said \u00e2\u20ac\u0153portfolio management\u00e2\u20ac\u009d. He asked,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d you are given two choices: 1 million INR straight away or 50,000 INR every year forever. Which one would you pick?\u00e2\u20ac\u009d. Now, this is based on the time value of money. The catch is to remember that it depends on the interest rate (and not your mood!). So I gave my final answer as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Sir, if the discount rate in the market is less than 5%, I will go for 50000 INR every year, else I will go for one million straight away\u00e2\u20ac\u009d. The interviewer followed up by asking, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153What is the rate currently?\u00e2\u20ac\u009d. I said, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153 T-bills are trading around 6%. And these are the lowest discount rates in INR. So, definitely I would go for 1 million right away.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d He then followed up by asking, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Fine... Sahil. You get your 1 million INR. How will you manage this money? Now once again, the reason why he asked this question is that I said earlier that I like portfolio management. So he was testing me. I asked two-three follow-up questions and ended up giving an elegant process-oriented answer like \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcinvestor preferences\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, \u00e2\u20ac\u02dccapital market expectations\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 (instead of something very crude like \u00e2\u20ac\u02dc20% in stock x and 80% in bond y\u00e2\u20ac\u2122), which is what I guess he was looking for. And there ended all the three technical rounds. What is the purpose of the HR round? What type of questions are asked in this round? What is the nature of this round? Finally, the easiest of the rounds: HR round. The whole purpose of this round is to see if the person is presentable, she knows that you have cleared the technical rounds, so she is in no way interested in knowing how smart you are. She just wants to see that, can you become a part of an organization that is ten times or 1000 times larger than you? So the questions that are asked are very standard. The first question is- introduce yourself. Why do you want to join Morgan Stanley? What are your strengths? Why should we hire you? Do you know the company? They even asked me if I am comfortable operating in the night shifts because they have a very fluctuating schedule because I will be working for US or Hong Kong clients who operate in a different time zone. These are very standard HR questions, and if you know enough about yourself, everything will go smoothly. What do you think about the weight a certification like CFA or FRM adds to a CV for this role? I personally believe that everyone should have a decent amount of financial literacy not just for placements but life in general. And, CFA Level 1 is the highest quality way there is towards that aim. It is conducted 4 times a year. No doubt it is costly, but there are scholarships available and many people are lucky to get one. For example, in my case, I got a scholarship in CFA level-2, so you can apply for scholarships and test your chances. Now suppose you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get a scholarship. You should again think once how passionate you are about this. Since you are not getting a scholarship, that means you are supposed to pay for it. If you believe that you are passionate about this, sooner or later, I want to learn about this, then pay it because it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s worth the money. Still, if you think that \u00e2\u20ac\u201d \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcI am not so sure about it, in that case, earlier I used to say, \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcgo for Varsity modules by Zerodha\u00e2\u20ac\u2122.But now I say that there is another option, i.e. CFA investment foundation, This charter is given by the CFA Institute itself. The difference is: CFA is a very comprehensive exam having three levels, and you have to pay for it. In contrast, the CFA investment foundation is free of cost, and you go on the CFA institute website, you make an account free of charge. You can easily enrol into the CFA investment foundation, whose content and coverage is nearly 20% of the CFA Level 1. Once you are done with the material, then tests are conducted, a short online test, if you clear the test you will get the certificate, and the whole thing was free, the only thing you invested was time and energy, so this is the second option for people who are not so sure & just wanna have a peek into finance. If you really want to go into finance while at IIT, then you need to pursue a charter\/ certification, there is no other option, so if you are honest and you want to pursue something in this field, you should do CFA level 1. I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t recommend FRM for the simple reason that FRM is financial risk management, and you will be able to do this properly only if you know some finance already. I have friends who have done FRM and have themselves admitted that CFA would have been a better certificate to pursue during IIT. So I do not recommend this course if anyone wants to learn finance. This is all from my side.

Hello, Aniket! Please go ahead. What was the general interview process for the companies you interviewed? Please mention the number of rounds and the nature of the interview process. I was shortlisted for a very diverse set of profiles including FMCG, SDE (Software Development Engineer), APM (Associate Product Manager) and BA (Business Analyst). Thankfully, after my first interview on Day 1, I got the offer and did not have to interview for the rest of the companies. The general process is 1 test followed by 1 day of interviews but the GMT(global management trainee) profile follows an unconventional process with a unique system of hiring. There were 6\u00e2\u20ac\u201c7 rounds spread across 1 month and the process started at the end of October. The first two rounds were tests, one of which was psychometric and gauged personality traits whereas the other tested focus and attention span. After clearing these preliminary tests, all the rounds which followed were interviews ranging from personal to group interviews. There was one round based on CV and another on HR. There was also a round on situational questions like \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcHow will you resolve a conflict between two teammates?\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 In group interviews, we were divided into teams and had to come up with a solution within a specified time limit. In the final round, we were paired with one more candidate either from Kgp or another college and were interviewed by the same panel which posed questions out of the box such as \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcWhat would you do with an aircraft and a billion dollars?\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. That was the deciding round. Could you please list down questions you were asked in the different rounds? Puzzles, technical questions, any other discussion in general that you think will prove to be helpful for students. Sure. So first let\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s talk about the test. In the psychometric test based on personality, companies basically check your consistency. For example, if the first question is \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcAre you a team player or do you like working alone?\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, let\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s say you answered that you are a team player. Towards the end, there will be a similar question framed in a different way such as \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcIf you are at a party, do you like to socialize with everyone or keep to yourself?\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 If you say that you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re a lone wolf, it would be contradictory to your previous answer so it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s essential to be consistent and say that you would prefer socializing. The second test was to check your concentration span, risk-taking abilities etc. For example, there was a question with a grid that had some coloured squares flashed on the screen for 2\u00e2\u20ac\u201c3 seconds. The grid was then rotated and you had to re-colour the same squares from memory. For such a test, you need to have a cool mind. Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t even think of it as an \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcexam\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 that you need to crack to get a job because that would make you nervous. Instead, consider it a game and give it your best. After that, there were two 2\u00e2\u20ac\u201c3 rounds of personal interviews. It is important to brush up on all the projects mentioned in your CV along with the technical details. For instance, I had a patent filed in the USA so my interviewer asked me, \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcIf you are on Shark Tank, how will you pitch your invention to me?\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 If you have a POR (Position of Responsibility), it is a good idea to talk about how you led your team and what were the obstacles you overcame while organising events. That shows leadership and ownership as well as time management. They will also ask you how you would tackle certain situations such as \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcIf your team was unable to meet a deadline, what would you do?\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a good idea to pull examples out of your CV where you dealt with a similar situation and that would create an impactful answer. Finally, for group interviews, try to avoid the common mistake of talking too much. Group discussions are more about listening to what others have to say, understanding all their various perspectives and weighing out their pros and cons. That shows you are a good listener and team player who takes the opinions of everyone into account. It also portrays you as a leader who formulates collective solutions by amalgamating the advantages of all the various solutions presented to you. What are some of the FAQs in most companies that you faced and think students must definitely prepare for? More specifically, in the context of HR rounds. Almost all the companies ask questions like \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcWhy do you want to join our firm?\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcWhy should we hire you?\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcWhy are you interested in this particular profile?\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 etc. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s basically just one question framed in many different ways that all have the same answer \u00e2\u20ac\u201d the culture of the company! Every company has a certain set of values that you can find on their website. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s this list of values that form their culture and while hiring, HR looks for the same values in candidates. Big brands like AB InBev receive applications from thousands of talented people who want to join their firm. Since almost everyone is very skilled, what becomes a deciding factor at that point is who fits into their culture and who does not. In the HR round, we were asked questions like \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcWhat are your biggest achievements?\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcWhat are your biggest failures?\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcHow did you overcome your failures?\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 etc. Pick instances from your CV and explain them. For situational questions like \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcYou have expertise in a certain aspect of a project and would be able to deliver well on it but someone else wants to work on it too. How will you convince him\/her to work on a different aspect of the project?\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, link your answer to at least one value of the company. Let\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s say the company considers teamwork an important value of their culture. You can answer by saying that you will negotiate with and suggest to the other person to work on an aspect of the project that they have greater expertise in because that would lead to better results for the team\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s project goals. This shows that you prioritise the success of your team, believe in teamwork and have an important value of the company so you can fit into their culture well. What are things students sitting for placements next year can do from now until December to maximize their chances of getting through a company in this sector? The common advice we hear is \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcBuild a strong CV\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 but I like to paraphrase it as \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcGain as many experiences as you can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 because every single POR that you sign up for, every single internship that you undertake, every single project that you work on exposes you to a wide array of experiences which help you grow as a person. You might find yourself in situations where you are working in a field that you have no expertise in so you will learn to teach yourself. You might find yourself in a team where most of the people are senior to you and you will learn how to convince them to adapt to new and more efficient systems. All of this really helps you expand your horizons and consequently have a strong CV. How did your preparation for technical rounds evolve once you were shortlisted? I did not have technical rounds as such, it was more about fitting into the culture of AB InBev. We often don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t realise that we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re quite well-prepared for technical rounds and should instead focus on HR rounds towards the end because most of us have little experience in that area. One change I made to my preparation when I got shortlisted was ramping up my HR preparation. I found a lot of question banks online which have almost all the questions that interviewers can ask you and the situations they can put you in, along with their answers. If you are not much of a reader, there are some YouTube channels like https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/channel\/UCrtPXCqjm9c7nqgJL-vBSZg which have very structured videos on how to answer every single HR question, right from \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcTell me about yourself\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 upto \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcHow will you know when it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to quit your job?\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Apart from that, know all the facts about the company. You can read up on their history as well as their recent events in the news. Be aware of new products they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re launching or campaigns they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re planning and so on. Anything else that you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d want to share with the students? Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t take up anything just for the sake of putting it up on your CV, do it because you actually like doing it. When you find yourself engaged in something that you really enjoy, you are bound to succeed and excel in it. So it will automatically end up on your CV. Sign up for projects with the open-mindedness and excitement to learn something new and not just to highlight it in your resume. Also, see your competitors as collaborators. Share your resources with others, study in groups and help each other out because that way you will be much better prepared rather than being all on your own. Thank you for all your valuable time, Samruddhi, I hope all of this advice will definitely help the aspirants out. Thank you for the interview, Aniket! I am happy to help. All the best!

Please mention the number of rounds and the nature of the interview process. Sure! One has to apply through the CDC portal. There are six rounds of interviews. Usually, before any round of interviews, candidates are shortlisted. First-round consists of a 20-minute extended psychometric test, there were 20 questions with two statements each, and I had to choose one out of them. The test wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t tough. It was pretty easy. The second round was a proper psychometric test that was about 1 hour long. The motive behind this round is to check different aspects of your personality, the values you hold on to, how much of a risk lover, or how much risk-averse you are. Most of the companies take this kind of test. For the third round, there was a portal, and I had a set of questions. Each question will pop up for 20 to 30 seconds, and then I had 2 to 3 minutes to give my response, and it was recorded. The fourth round is an in-person interview. They asked HR questions. It ended up with a conversation about my CV, and they asked me to elaborate on the points mentioned in the CV. The fifth round was a team challenge where you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re paired with people from across colleges, and you need to brainstorm and come up with solutions to the problem statement. The sixth round was a panel interview. There were three panels with three panellists each. You\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re paired up with one other candidate and discussion with all three panels. Could you please list down questions were you asked in the different rounds? Puzzles, technical problems, any other discussion in general that you think will prove helpful for students. The first two rounds are psychometric; you can not do anything that you are, and you can not cheat on that. The questions in the HR round are like, tell me about yourself or tell me about your plans. I was also asked about my biggest challenge and failure, how do you do assignments that you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to do. In the parallel interview round, they grilled me a little on my CV. As I have mentioned in it, I like reading books, making me guesstimate around books. They also gave me a few situational questions and asked how I would respond to those conditions. You should be honest, keep a smile, and be confident during the selection rounds. What are some of the FAQs you face and think students must prepare for in most companies? More specifically, in the context of HR rounds. In my opinion, the HR interview round is the underrated part of the selection process, but sometimes, people are not selected. In the HR round, they want to learn about your background, how you present your views in front of them, and most importantly, whether you would be a good cultural fit or not. Tell me about yourself, your future goals, your biggest failure, why this firm or role, and how college life helped shape you: these are examples of common HR questions. AB InBev has a set of principles that they follow that is listed on their website. They will give you the situation and judge you based on those principles. It is helpful to visit the company website and find out what they look for in their people. In general, it is good to have some knowledge about the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s background. Some questions related to my CV were \u00e2\u20ac\u201d What exactly did you do in this internship? What did you learn in the internship? What are the skills you have gained in this particular PoR? It would help if you were well-versed with your CV, and you should be comfortable answering any questions related to it. What are things students sitting for placements next year can do from now until December to maximise their chances of getting through a company in this sector? One can read interviews online and understand what firms are working on. They will hire you to work on similar projects, so if you know what they are working on, you can answer them how can you be proved helpful for them. Seventy per cent of the selection process tests your personality, and thirty per cent in the business game, for which reading about the industry and few case studies will be helpful. Practice with people. You can practice HR questions with people as all of us have to face that. One valuable thing which I did, was creating an excel sheet, where I listed down all the ten principles and why they are essential to me in the first column. In the second column, I demonstrated this particular trait or characteristic, which will be very helpful as sometimes they ask you questions indirectly so that you get an idea of what they are referring to. How did your preparation for technical rounds evolve once you were shortlisted? I would like to mention a couple of companies that arrive on Day 1 or Day2, like ITC, HUL, P&G in the FMCG sector. You have more technical questions for other firms, but AB InBev puts less stress on technical knowledge. There is no technical round involved in the process. Anything else that you would want to share with the students? Placements can be a difficult phase of life, do not compare; believe in yourself. Enjoy the process, remain devoted and consistent with the preparation. Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get bound to a particular company; you may like a specific company, but if you are not selected for it, that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not the end of the world. For juniors, take the most out of the KGP; explore it as much as you can. Take different projects, courses, join other societies, fests or cells. All the best!

If you look at the profile of product management, it is relatively a very young profile, started around 2001 when the internet came into the picture, and many startups were booming into Silicon Valley in the US. There was a need for a role that coordinated with various teams of a company like the Business team, UI team and Software team. They used to figure out what users\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 problems are, what they want from their digital products, what problems to solve, what pain to prioritize, and when there was a need for a person who can do that. PMs are user representative of the company, and they coordinate with all the teams to work on projects that are most important to the company and the users. Product management is about solving users\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 problems through different features and additions to the product. What was the general interview process for the company you interviewed, and tell us how to prepare for that? Please mention the number of rounds and the nature of the interview process. The Selection procedure of Flipkart will almost encompass a month or a month and a half. It will start from a regular ppt session in which they will tell you about product management. This time, they had a workshop where they gave the students a basic idea of the kind of cases they will be facing, and they had a case workshop after the ppt. Moving on from that, Flipkart every year has a deck submission to be provided which finalizes you to be shortlisted. They keep a similar problem statement every year, but they changed their problem statement this year due to COVID. So, you have a problem statement wherein you have to submit a deck. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a small deck of typically 8\u00e2\u20ac\u201c10 slides explaining how you solve the problem with the help of technology. This year we had a shortlist of 8 students. Depending on your buddies and how you interact with them, you will have 3\u00e2\u20ac\u201c4 buddy sessions with the 8\u00e2\u20ac\u201c10 students selected in the company in the past 2\u00e2\u20ac\u201c3 years. They will help you in gaining interview experience. So they will conduct mock interviews. After you shortlist in the final interview, you will have some 15\u00e2\u20ac\u201c20 days to prepare well for your interview, and you will give some 2 or 3 buddy sessions in that time frame. Suppose that in Flipkart, you have five rounds to get selected. Finally, each round is an elimination round. The first round is simply problem-solving. The following two rounds revolve around product design and product thinking. The fourth round is a technical round which checks your basic knowledge of how the tech system works and whether you understand them well. The last round is Fit Round. How you are fit for the role and the company. That is how the selection procedure goes for Flipkart. Next is how to prepare for: 1. PPT (Pre-placement talk) of Flipkart: It is essential that you attend that ppt because that clears many doubts around product management, what people look for in a candidate, what exactly is the role, what exactly we are preparing for. Also, from the past year, they have started to conduct a workshop after that ppt. It gives a good head start. 2. Slide or Deck Submission: Last year, the problem set was based on covid; every year, the problem statement will change. But the main thing is to solve a problem using technology. If you have the essential skill of breaking down problems, use technology to solve every pinpoint problem. They are more interested in how you reach the solution. So whatever may be the number of submissions, only 8\u00e2\u20ac\u201c10 students will clear that round. So, focus well on your deck submission; you have 10\u00e2\u20ac\u201c12 days for that. So break your problem well, don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t try to solve it as a whole. 3. Product case: After the deck submission, I started preparing for the product case post my deck submission shortlist. Whoever wants to sit for placement for non-core roles like product management, product analyst role, business analyst or marketing, I want to encourage them to first prepare for the consult case interview. It will help you understand many aspects of a case interview, help you know how to define a problem, break a problem, and structure your thoughts very well. Even though I have done some preliminary case preparation, at least I cleared the basics, so I shortlisted for Flipkart. That is the time when you should start working on different types of product case rounds. These are divided into 3 buckets: Problem-solving, the other is the product thinking bucket, and the third bucket is the other market entry cases. Now all of those 3 cases, you will have pretty good buddy sessions with your buddy associated with Flipkart so that they will guide you well into the process. You can form product cases around you, try to solve issues every day. We generally solved two or three cases each day; we used to have 2-hour calls every day to solve cases with each other, and finally, we had buddy cases each week with our seniors. For preparing for all these three types of interview, a lot of resources are available. There are many good books, like cracking the PM interview, preparing for the Product Interview, or Decode and Conquer; youtube channels like Exponent or StellarPeers or Product Management exercises are available. Watching mock interviews are a great source of learning. So I think there are resources available online. As some essential preliminary case interview, you can start going through them and look for problems on each bucket and then solve them, solving as many cases as you can. I will recommend solving 2 cases per day to crack the APM round; other than that, Flipkart also has some technical rounds. This technical round checks fundamental technical understanding, so there is an excellent book \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Swipe to Unlock\u00e2\u20ac\u009d, which you can refer to, which will walk you through the basics of all the technologies around you. Working in Product Management, you have to interact with the software engineers. You have many videos on youtube; you can refer to them to understand how basic things, like how WhatsApp messaging, how google drive or some basic questions like how the google search works, so that is it & the last round is off. 4. Product fit round: This round is like any other round where they will ask you fundamental questions like what will you do in future situations, like when you have to help your Colleague who is facing some issues or why Flipkart, why the APM role, so all of those questions. One general doubt, is there any technical round involved in the process? And does one need to know how to code for product management roles? Yes, the technical round is there, but coding is not required in this round. When you go even into your role as APM or as a product manager, there will be shipping features, you will be primarily working on digital products, and you would have to shift elements with your software engineers. Shipping features is like releasing a new update, even when you feel like daily, the Flipkart has is you were using from the ten years, you have seen a lot of changes in that. You can see many changes in the interface, so the people responsible for that changes are product managers, but they should know how these changes will come into place and how they have to share their product features with their software team. How they communicate with them, How they build and ship these features. You should understand how fundamental tech works, so you should understand the problems, how you manage the database, how the essential search works, and the difference between the back end and the front end. A lot of these crucial things so that you can ship and communicate with your software engineers better. Coding is not required. Could you please list down questions were you asked in the different rounds? Puzzles, technical problems, any other discussion in general that you think will prove helpful for students. Flipkart doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have any puzzle round; those are all product cases round and the technical and finally the fit round. So my first round was problem-solving, and the problem that I dealt with was that some offer going in the Flipkart with the advertising revenue was not increasing. So I had to find a problem and then give some solutions to counter that. My second round was the problem thinking round. I had to improve the experience of the people age above 45 on google pay; this is my second round. My third round was thinking round, where I had to go ten years back, around the time when Ola started. Then I had to build the algorithm for matching a user (customer) to the driver. In my fourth round, there were fundamental technical questions, like types of databases, how ads work, how to replace an application and a browser, or what technology to get a better experience on Flipkart. The final round was fit, a behavioural round as they set the questions like why APM? Why Product Management? How will you help your Colleague? What is that one problem you observe in Kharagpur? So I think after you clear the four rounds, your 5th round shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be that hard, but you should be sincere in that round, or you should stick to your strengths and your weaknesses while you share any thoughts in that round. What are some of the FAQs you face and think students must prepare for in most companies? More specifically, in the context of HR rounds. Not just for the context of the HR round, but the point is, there are no frequently asked questions. Questions depend on what company and what role you are interviewing for; the HR questions revolve around them; why this profile? Your profile seems like this, then Why not go for this? I see many people who are very talented going to interview panicking and not able to interact or share their thoughts with the interviewer. This finally leads to their rejections, so I would urge everyone sitting for placements to dedicate some time to think of how the interview will go into your head and what kind of person you want to show about you. Every HR question, every interview starts from \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Tell me about yourself\u00e2\u20ac\u009d, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Why this role?\u00e2\u20ac\u009d So every question has its story behind it. The interviewer who is sitting in front of you has to take 20 or 30 interviews, and if you go on to ramble your CV and go on to tell something that you have learnt in your mind or try to speak it out continuously, it won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t separate you from the crowd. So you must prepare your story well, schedule your personal opinion on yourself. Another important thing I have seen happening with many people (KGPians) was fear of the interview and panic in many discussions with Flipkart. Each year, we see some candidates getting intimidated by the interviewer, so it is essential to stay calm. The interviewer is a guide; when you go for an interview, the interviewer is there only to guide you through the process, think of him as a senior who is helping you to work with a problem and helping you solve it. Suppose you think of him as someone who is here to reject you or someone far higher than you. In that case, people life will be panicking. The critical skill is having your stories defined well, expressing who you are and what you are really and communicating well with the interviewer, and answering your questions well in a good state of mind. These two things will fly you through any HR round and not this HR but any other round if you have any technical knowledge about them. What are things students sitting for placements next year can do from now until December to maximize their chances of getting through a company in this sector? First, this must be about the time of the mid-Feb end, you start preparing for your interview, for your placement in your head, so, first of all, you need to understand what profile you want to target, and then stick to that profile, because you will need a time frame for preparing for any role. It would be best to understand whether I should go with the functions of software or roles that are more inclined towards the non-core roles or more inclined towards the core engineering role. The most important thing people have to keep in mind is that they have built a lot of noise around you while going through the process. Let say you are preparing for the non-core, and your friends keep telling you that. Oh, Dude! You are so poor; you really won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get placed. One of those is True. Just stick to your strength. So I never coded, never went far for any software role, nor was I giving that test. I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to go for software roles in my future, and I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think of myself as a Software Engineer. I know that I want to go for some non-core role, like product management, or consult, or a normal position, like a business analyst or product analyst. So you should know that and stick to it because you will have enough company for each role, stick to two or three core profiles, which you want to target and then go work around that. I think this year. Placements were online, so many people working from home might say that peer pressure was unnecessary because you are at home. Still, you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know how the other person is preparing and what other people are doing, so if the next semester you come to the campus, another factor that is a considerable impact is peer pressure; many people are preparing for placement. So think, keep in touch with your peers; peer pressure is significant, but don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get intimidated by any person. Placement is a very long process, and it starts with the overall autumn semester; remaining calm in the whole process will work, and at the end of the day, you will get good results; you will get good placement, no matter what. And how far do the positions of responsibility on the campus help you? How has life in KGP has supported you for this role? In my first year, I wanted to work on my communication skills, so, I went for every audition that I could find in KGP; I wanted to go in these auditions, talk in that selection round so that I could speak up, I could share my opinion in English, even though very basic. I was a part of E-cell for a year-and-half, I took two positions of responsibilities. They help you a lot in understanding how to present yourself professionally, how to talk to people. I was in the sponsorship team, so I had to make a lot of phone calls. It makes one realize how to present yourself, know their persona, and handle different companies. So if you are looking for the POR as a way to boost up your CV, like a lot of people think of POR as a judging base as a shortlist, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not true. Some companies may have some inclination towards POR, but mainly after going through all the placement process, I have seen shortlisting on ideas based on tests and, in some cases, based on consult. A lot of other things matter, your CG, extracurricular activities, internships and not just POR. POR is a way to improve yourself, improve your communication skills, professional skills, and not get your CV shortlisted. Finally, the POR helps you in the interview. So my POR was of E-cell; I learnt how the startup works and how the organizations function. How different roles made each other. So that helped a lot. But I have not seen anyone getting a job just because of their POR. Anything else that you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d want to share with the students? So the most important thing is to be cautious while the placement process is going on. There will be many ups and downs, starting right from when the test starts (some tests begin in June). The shortlists will start coming. Initially, some companies come on Day 0. The important thing is to remain calm throughout the time frame. Some intense buddy sessions are also required; we worked day and night on product cases, 2 or 3 cases round each day professionally. A serious buddy session will determine what profile you want to go for.

The main focus of the Product Management field is analysing how an existing product or a new product within a broad segment can be improved or shaped in its conceptual design, available features, brand marketing and ease of accessibility, primarily to serve the targets of expanding into new customer base and further enhancing the experience of the existing customer base. This analysis is carried out using various tools\/frameworks of interpretation of data collected from research, industry, product statistics, etc. It combines it with a contextual understanding of consumer behaviour, derived using study, observation, and experience of various dimensions of the society. What was the general interview process for the company you interviewed, and tell us how to prepare for that? Please mention the number of rounds and the nature of the interview process. There were three One-On-One rounds in the process carried out on Google Meet. There was no separation of rounds as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153technical\u00e2\u20ac\u009d or \u00e2\u20ac\u0153HR\u00e2\u20ac\u009d as there was reasonably diverse interaction involved during each round. As soon as a round got completed, I moved into a new meeting link, and thus the three rounds carried on successively roughly. The entire process lasted for about 60\u00e2\u20ac\u201c70 minutes. One general doubt, is there any technical round involved in the process? And does one need to know how to code for product management roles? There is no technical round involved in the process. You don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t require coding experience for PM roles. Could you please list down questions were you asked in the different rounds? Puzzles, technical problems, any other discussion in general that you think will prove helpful for students. A Product Case Study [PPT format] submission was to be submitted on how WhatsApp can integrate digital payment about two weeks before the first day of interviews. On Interview: [1] In the first round, I was asked to tell about myself, long-term goals etc. and give insights on a couple of simple real-world problems related to decision making. Example: Suppose I give you a piece of land (not fertile, can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be used for agriculture), what will you do with it? And follow up questions based on the replies. [2] In the second round, I was asked questions based on my Internship\/Project. Then they made me solve a classic Product Case: to think of a new product feature in the finance segment and design its rough user experience and insights on what nudges can be used in marketing it. [3] The final round made me analyse a website, spending about 10\u00e2\u20ac\u201c15 minutes navigating through it, giving input on what changes can be done to various website features to make it a more user-friendly experience and improve its brand perception. What are some of the FAQs you face and think students must prepare for in most companies? More specifically, in the context of HR rounds. Fortunately I faced only one company. Questions like, how has your college life, internship\/project, has helped in shaping you up, what are your long term goals, what are subjects and skills that you enjoy pursuing the most, why did you choose this particular sector and firm, are some examples of common HR questions. What are things students sitting for placements next year can do from now until December to maximise their chances of getting through a company in this sector? On a personal level, I did not prepare for Product Management apart from working on a Financial Product for about a month in my Internship, but it is helpful to spend one-two weeks solving standard Product Cases for those entirely new for the domain. Later on, as placement season comes closer, solving CAT-type aptitude problems and mock interviews based on CV and HR questions might help because they are asked in almost all tests across sectors. And how far do the positions of responsibility on the campus help you? How has life in KGP has supported you for this role? My early experience in Awaaz helped me become better at reading and writing and, more importantly, to get in touch with seniors, make some good friends live, and share various life experiences that would help me understand myself and the world I am in better. Later on, working on case studies and projects in setting up Shastrarth, apart from getting better pictures of the local student community, I learned crucial aspects of design and leadership, primarily through new interactions and repeated failures in various plans. While taking upon these responsibilities, I never had any professional leverage to target by the position. It is more the lessons as mentioned earlier acquired with the flow that helps in professional roles. Anything else that you would want to share with the students? Often, it is who you are outside your CV points that matter in the long run. The most important piece of advice is not to be bothered much about what others are doing. Curate your decisions according to your goals, be it any sector or role.

Sure! Product management is about learning what users want, your company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s goals related to a product, and translating those thoughts and ideas into product solutions. You do that through a series of creativity and development processes. One way to understand product management is to imagine it as a juxtaposition of user experience, technology and business. Where all these three things meet, I think that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s product management. What was the general interview process for the company you interviewed, and tell us how to prepare for that? Please mention the number of rounds and the nature of the interview process. Generally, there are three rounds of interviews on campus, but these can differ from company to company. Usually, before any rounds of interviews, candidates are shortlisted. You have to make a solution deck based on the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s problem statement within a specified time frame. Based on the deck and the CV, students get shortlisted for the interview rounds. The idea is during these rounds; you have to answer product and business cases. They might ask guesstimates, product thinking cases, problem-solving cases and strategy questions. There can also be a dedicated round for HR and technical problems. MX Player was the first and only company I interviewed for, and I had to go through 2 rounds of interviews. The first round was about 45 minutes long, and I was asked a guesstimate and some product thinking and solving cases. The whole motive behind this round is to check your logical and structural thinking process. They observe how you respond to questions, process your thoughts and ideas, and reach a solution. The second round was about an hour long. They asked me a mix of product cases as well as HR questions. It ended up with a casual conversation about my CV, and they asked me to elaborate on the relevant experiences mentioned in it. For product management or any managerial role, you need to prepare product and business cases and case studies. Have a good case group to practice cases with and be aware of what\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s going on worldwide. It is one of those career paths that are very interesting and complex because you can not learn it academically. It is something that you know with experience, which comes from practice and keeping yourself informed. One general doubt, is there any technical round involved in the process? And does one need to know how to code for product management roles? Some companies do have a technical round, but it doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t involve coding. They judge your technical understanding and general concepts around the technical domain. Coding is not necessary for product management roles because you usually don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have to code yourself as a Product Manager. But since PMs interact with developers and technical personnel, you need to be aware of the basic concepts and understand their jargon. So, coding is not mandatory, but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a plus point if you have that skill set. Could you please list down questions were you asked in the different rounds? Puzzles, technical problems, any other discussion in general that you think will prove helpful for students. During the first round, I was asked a guesstimate where they wanted to know how good I was with numbers and if I could structurally convey that information. The interviewer also asked what my favourite product was and how I could improve it. I was also asked to identify the metrics and KPIs to measure the success of an app. They wanted me to solve a problem regarding the decrease of daily active users. In the next round, they grilled me a little on my CV. They asked me questions like \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Why do you want to pursue product management\u00e2\u20ac\u009d, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Why this company\u00e2\u20ac\u009d. They also gave me a few situational questions and asked how I would respond to those conditions. Finally, they gave me a product strategy case to solve. Since there was a lot to discuss during these interviews, I had to keep track of time and answer concisely. It is essential to think out-of-the-box. To do that, stay updated with what is happening around you in the tech, business and product domain. That is the most critical aspect, and it is crucial to remain aware. Because only if you have spent some exploring products and businesses can you form an opinion about them and discuss them comfortably and objectively with the interviewer. What are some of the FAQs you face and think students must prepare for in most companies? More specifically, in the context of HR rounds. One general question is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153What\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s your favourite product?\u00e2\u20ac\u009d. It seems like an easy question, but there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a lot you can do with it. If answered structurally, there is a lot of knowledge that you can showcase and stand out in interviews. Some other examples can be \u00e2\u20ac\u201d \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Determine the market for iPhone users in India.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d or \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There has been a 10% decrease in the daily watch time of YouTube, identify the problem and suggest some solutions?\u00e2\u20ac\u009d. To prepare for such questions, some resources give us a comprehensive list of such problems and suggest ways to tackle those questions. For example, books like \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcCracking the PM interviews\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcDecode and Conquer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 might be of use. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Swipe to Unlock\u00e2\u20ac\u009d is a great book to understand the basics of tech. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Stellarpeers\u00e2\u20ac\u009d and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Product management exercises\u00e2\u20ac\u009d are good online platforms where you can find popular questions asked during interviews. These are some of the resources that will give you ample practice. For HR questions and specific situation-based questions, you need to be well-versed with your CV, and you should be comfortable answering any questions related to it. Their motive is to catch your interest and passion about the field \u00e2\u20ac\u201d whether it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an informed choice you have made to pursue it or is it just a backup option for you. With rigorous practice, you can become comfortable in handling cases and case studies. You have to keep on practising with your case group because it is not something that you can learn within a short period. What are things students sitting for placements next year can do from now until December to maximise their chances of getting through a company in this sector? For the next batch sitting for placements, the first step should be to identify what field\/career they are interested in. Time is of the essence, and you shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t split your efforts too much. If you have already determined that and if you know what you are passionate about, then it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s okay, but if not, you must figure it out as soon as you can. Whether you aim for product management or not, it is essential to practice puzzles and HR questions. As product management is a very competitive field, you must show that you have a genuine interest. Practice puzzles and keep yourselves updated with what\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s going on worldwide in the Product and Business space. Find a good set of people with whom you are comfortable, form a case group and start solving cases and guesstimates together. And how far do the positions of responsibility on the campus help you? How has life in KGP has supported you for this role? PORs can help you showcase your team leading and teamwork capabilities for product management roles. If you have good PORs listed in your CV, it can help get you shortlisted for interview rounds. If you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have any such experience in your CV, don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be disheartened since companies give weightage to solution decks for shortlisting. The overall campus experience helped me through the placement process. Whether it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s internships, projects or departmental courses, all this allows you to showcase your skills, no matter how far apart your department is from what you are aiming for. The best part of KGP life is that there are so many opportunities and so much you can learn each day. No matter what you are interested in, you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll find many chances to explore and develop your skills. So, IITKGP helped me explore and meet good people who helped me throughout this journey. Anything else that you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d want to share with the students? For any pre-final or final year student facing a dilemma, I would suggest staying calm. It is a phase of life, and I am sure that they will do well if they keep faith in themselves and work hard towards what they want. Placement is all about persistence and perseverance; you have to keep putting in efforts even if you think things are not working your way, without worrying too much about the result. It is also an excellent time to stay connected with your friends and learn together. I would suggest you keep working hard and start early. For the first and second-year students, I think college life is essential for exploring as much as possible and try to make the most of all that KGP offers. Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be fixated on placements just yet; and instead, focus on exploring your interests and passion. Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t forget to enjoy your KGP life!

I was preparing for Data science, and apart from that, in my 2nd year and 3rd year, I did two projects under certain professors; that was the only time I was engaged in the core. After that, at the end of 3rd year and in the whole 4th year, I did two internships and prepared for Data science itself. I was preparing for both core as well as non-core. But I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t give much time to the core; I gave more time to coding and Data sciences. And to be frank, I was not wholly dedicated to the core. I dedicated more time to data science. I was trying to find a job in Data Science. Hence, if I had not been selected for Airbus, I would have been trying for Fractal Analytics. What was the general interview process (number of rounds, questions asked, topics they questioned about in each round, etc.) for the companies that you aimed for? There was one test, and after that, there were two rounds of interviews. The test had some questions of Aptitude, general mathematics, Aerospace itself, a few from marketing and other areas. I think that test was prepared so that anyone can answer a certain number of questions. I believe that the test was not designed to focus on any particular topic. It was like a general aptitude test though I was disappointed to see an irrelevant question for an Aerospace Engineer. But it was clear that it was not designed in such a way to give more priority to some topics. Also, I was applying for other related companies. And my previous internships one was in Computer vision, the other was in Data collection and Data characterization. Many of us have heard that one should aim for going into the core sector only when your CG is high. Would you like to comment on that statement? Okay, so this particular question\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s weight seems too heavy for people with low CG and tend to fear it. I had the same fear. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s why I was trying for Data Science. But from my experience, I can say that it was not a major point. If you can explain in the right way that why your CG is low, then the interviewers can understand that you are interested in the core but are also parallelly doing stuff other than core. Rather than just thinking about low CG, you have to defend yourself for it. Because we can also understand that if we are going for core means you are reading a subject, your marks are low, then either your aptitude is low, or there is some problem, which means you are not dedicated. So you have to explain that you are doing projects or internships or that you are more into practical stuff than in theory. The CG cut-off for this year was 6. This means the CG cut-off was six but I was not shortlisted in many companies for which I was trying. So, a minimum of 7.5 is necessary as a benchmark. Any resources you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d like to mention which you used while preparing? E.g.- any additional subjects you took, online courses, books, etc. Yeah, as I have done two projects in my 2nd and 3rd year. So while I was doing the projects, I was wholly dedicated to them. I read quite a lot of research papers related to my projects. If someone puts up any question and I will quickly answer, I know every key point and all the theory related to them. My first project was designing a wing; a group of 4 students tried creating a glider wing. And my 2nd project was the implementation of Tubercles. What was your strategy for preparation? Did you change it depending on which company you were aiming for and in between rounds? In the core profile, I was aiming for only Airbus, so I used to follow the news, updates about Airbus. Like in my interview, I was asked about the aeroplane Beluga. In the interview, I told more about my projects during my introduction, so they started to ask questions related to them. After that, there were questions posed only about my projects. In the first round of the interview, they asked some questions related to data science as I have done internships related to it. For Data Science, they asked generic things like recall and precision. So for preparation, one should focus on the course itself and some research papers. I was pretty confident about the data science part, so the last few days I spent revising the project going through every point and the concepts related to it, I was recreating my experience of the project itself. Revising in this particular manner, I was able to answer all the questions that they asked. So these are some basic steps that everyone should take, and I took it too. I did not do any external research in the coursework. I just revised what I have already done and took a peep at what the company is currently doing. I asked one of my friends who was also placed in Airbus about the questions that the interviewer asked, but they were completely different. None of the questions matched. But the pattern in which they asked questions was the same. Like my friend has done some work in control, so they asked questions related to control. And I had done my projects in Aerodynamics, so they asked questions from the Aerodynamics, in my interview. What are the opportunities in the core sector? Actually, I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think there are many options in the core sector, at least in Aerospace. Because ISRO opens for Electrical, Mechanical, and other branches but not for Aerospace, Airbus is the only company we can try. There is also DHL, but I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think they are actively recruiting. So Airbus is the only option as Boeing is not coming too. Generally, there are nine profiles in Aerospace one can opt for, but there is not much opportunity. Many people are going for MS, but I was not interested in research, so I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know much about it. Not in India, but in foreign countries, there are vast opportunities in research for Aerospace Engineering. What advice would you like to give your juniors who will be sitting for placements this year? From my experience, my advice will be if you have less time and are trying for both things, then understand entirely and revise the work you have done. And be careful about the part where they ask you to introduce yourself because that is where you can direct them to ask any question you want. These are the things that I had learned from my experience of my internships interviews. Focussing too much on the things which you do not know shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be done. Just be thorough with what you know and do it perfectly. It will fetch you an excellent job. What would you like to say to the general KGP public out there? Any advice for them? When there is this dilemma of going for core profile or not, one must notice that getting a job in the core is tricky because there are fewer opportunities, but at the same time, it is easy as fewer people are trying, so now it is balanced. Most people think that core is complex, so very few are trying. So I would say that if you are interested, you should try because many people believe that it is challenging, and they drop the idea of taking up the core. Also, if you are confused, you can prepare for two profiles; preparing for two profiles is not very hectic, in my opinion. Because we generally have ample time to explore things in KGP. I wasted too much time still I was able to prepare for both of them. Hence, even you guys can also do it. I wish all the very best to everyone out there!

We have Mr. Akhilesh Nalanagula, who has been placed at Cairn Oil and Gas. So, our first question is, how did you decide to go into the core profile? Considering that coding and data analytics are usually most talked about. Actually, when I was in my second year, I got introduced to various subjects related to Earth, and I fell in love with those subjects, and it was then that I decided to go for the core. The scope for the applications of the latest trending topics like Artificial Intelligence and Deep Learning in our core sector (for oil and gas explorations) increased my interest in this domain. The fact that there is a bit of coding and such stuff being involved and at the same time getting to know more about Earth got me inclined towards the core sector. Can you please explain the general interview process for the companies you aimed for from your experience. The only company I applied for was in the oil and gas sector. It came on day one. The interview process consisted of multiple rounds; The CGPA cutoff was 7.5. After that, they shortlisted around 30 students also for the written test. The written test had questions from aptitude and mainly from geophysics and geology. The duration was 1 hour. Then around 21 students were shortlisted again for group discussion. Then finally, about five students were shortlisted for the personal interviews. So these are the primary rounds of the recruitment process. Thank you, so we now have understood about the general in the interview process. So, now would you like to give a detailed overview step by step? Yeah, sure, these are the steps. There was the CV shortlisting, so all the students who had CGPA above 7.5 were allowed to sit in their written test. It had around 35 questions. 10 out of those were related to aptitude and mental aptitude, which were of primary level and were not complicated. They were straightforward. There were 25 questions, mainly from geophysics and geology. Primarily the questions were from seismic, well logging and structural geology. Then we had a group discussion, which was approximately 30 minutes. The first 20 minutes were for conversation and in the last 10 minutes, we had to give our respective conclusions. The topics were general (e.g. lessons learnt from Corona, E-learning benefits and disadvantages, etc.) After the group discussion, we had a personal interview. There were questions mainly related to previous internships which I had done. There were some technical questions related to my core subjects and few HR questions as well. Yes, so. I guess you have summed up the entire process in a very detailed manner. So now I have one more question. People generally believe you should maintain a very high CGPA for entering a core field. So is that true? I mean, you already said that it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 7.5, so is it valid for most of the companies? See, actually cut off lies around 7.5 to 8, so it depends on the company and its policies, and it may change from year to year. The relative performance among fellow batch mates, like if more people are scoring around nine, and if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re having around eight that may put you in trouble. So I would say that we need to be in the top three to four students of your batch, and that would be a safe zone because there are fewer companies, which makes the competition even more challenging for our core sector. Even if a student is not in the top 3\u00e2\u20ac\u201c4 students of the batch (as per CGPA), a firm grip on the fundamentals of core subjects and some internships in the core sector will make that student a strong candidate. Yeah, so we have completed our most searched question about the CGPA; the next thing is what resources you use to prepare for the companies? Any books or from anywhere? For me, I mainly referred to my class notes. The class notes were very, very useful. Apart from that, I had a couple of books that I will suggest. I will list them down: Seismic: Geldart and Sherrif Gravity, Magnetic: Telford Well logging: Class notes, Paul Grover\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s notes. So this means following the KGP curriculum was more than enough for your preparation. Yeah, it was enough. If the student is interested, he\/she may refer to the different books which I have suggested or as suggested by professors. And that is all about the preparation resources which we need to follow. And the next thing is, what was the strategy for preparation? Did you Change it in between rounds? Yeah, so um, I prepared for this company stage by stage. For the written test: Class notes and the knowledge acquired over the last four years are sufficient. For Group Discussion: This is a very crucial round for this company. Regardless of the student\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s capabilities in the core sector, the officials will filter out the students who do not perform in GDs. So, I prepared for these group discussions from youtube videos mainly. That was sufficient. I would suggest the student prepare his\/her opening\/conclusion\/other relevant templates before the group discussion itself. For personal interview: The questions will be fundamental, and the student is expected to be strong in fundamentals. So, the preparation of 2 months before the interview was sufficient for me. Important subjects were: Seismic, well logging. Gravity, magnetic. I prepared these subjects thoroughly, and also I made sure to revise my past internship works thoroughly as most questions are asked from internships. So, that was my preparation strategy. Yes, so you said that specific questions should be prepared, from some chapters, so which are those? Yes, so there are a couple of topics which are very, very important. First subject and the most crucial subject: Seismic methods of prospecting (Acquisition and Processing). Other important topics: Well logging, Gravity and magnetic methods. And the topics in which the student has done his\/her internships. So you said this before. You said that there was a CV shortlisting round. What, according to you, is first the most important thing? Specifically, they would have seen you see the internship or the CGPA or anything else. CGPA is, ofcourse, very important, but at the same time, they look at the internships that the student has done. They prefer students with internships in core companies \/ even research internships related to the core. I guess that was Great, so considering that you had gone to the core sector, could you say something about what other opportunities are there in the core sector? Okay, a couple of years ago, like in, 2019 many companies used to recruit students from our campus: ONGC, Schlumberger, Cairn, Exxon Mobil. But post covid, the situation completely changed and this year, only two companies came, which recruited three students from geophysics (including 2 yr MSc courses). So, honestly speaking, there are limited opportunities in the industrial sector, but there are many opportunities in the research sector. Research is a good option if the student is interested. One more thing I would like to ask that in KGP, people are generally given the fundae that POR\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s matter a lot. What do you think about it relating to your field? PORs matter but only to some extent. It ultimately comes down to the skills that they are looking for in the student. Having some PORs is a plus point, but even if the student doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have any, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s okay if he\/she is into some king of extracurricular activity (hobby or something). OK, I think the next question is what advice would you like to give to your juniors who will be sitting for the placements this year? Anything you would like to feel like to say? So for Geology And Geophysics students, all I would say for those companies is to be fundamentally strong in the core subjects. They should also practice some quantitative aptitude for the tests. They should also keep one backup option ready (coding\/data science\/ research). Just one doubt. We should be preparing for the backup thing or the core things, or we should be preparing both Simultaneously. Yeah, both simultaneously should be prepared because the situation gets a bit unpredictable in this core sector and having a backup plan always helps.

This is Sadhvika from Communiqu\u00c3\u00a9. Heartiest congratulations on being placed at Western Digital. Should we begin our discussion? Thank you Sadhvika! Yeah, sure, let\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s have a discussion. Please go ahead. How did you decide to go in the core profile, considering that coding and data are the most discussed? The answer to your question; I did prepare for the coding interview, mostly algorithms part, but most of my seniors and friends were into core profiles, so I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t prefer coding. My profile included coding in core profiles. So I had prepared for both of them. What was the general interview process (number of rounds, questions asked, topics they questioned about in each round, etc.) for the companies that you aimed for? I mainly aimed for core profiles only, especially the embedded core electronics profiles. I was shortlisted for two companies; Enphase Solar Energy PVT LTD and Western Digital. Western Digital had the prerequisite of a CGPA above 7.5 to appear for their exam. They considered our performance in their exam interview only. They verified all that was relevant in my CV in the interview itself. I had completed an online course on Verilog, which is very useful for embedded core electronics, especially for FPGA and IC designing. They had asked me questions regarding this as it was relevant to their company. On the other hand, Enphase focused more on the CV. I went through four rounds for Western Digital, where they ask basic digital electronics questions. For this, you should be thorough with the things taught in your courses and Verilog coding. The second round was the Analog profiles, where I was asked questions taught in class, and also, you should be updated on the new technologies in Analog. Reading some research papers would do good. The third round was with the Director, where they asked some HR questions and some theory questions. Here they verified all that was mentioned on your CV. The final round was the HR round. In Enphase, I got shortlisted for an embedded core electronics profile. I had two rounds of interviews. The first one was software-based, and the second one was based on core electronics and HR round. In the first round, they asked questions on the much-talked topic; the Internet of Things. Many of us have heard that one should aim for going into the core sector only when your CG is high. Would you like to comment on that statement? The cutoff for core profiles is very high, around 8\u00e2\u20ac\u201c8.5. Some companies like Nvidia have their cutoff above 9. So to qualify for their written exams, you need a high CGPA. The most important thing for core profiles is that you must be thorough with all your concepts. The questions asked are very similar to the ones asked in college vivas. A CGPA of about above eight is considered good enough. Any resources you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d like to mention which you used while preparing? E.g.- any additional subjects you took, online courses, books etc. It is highly recommended to do some additional work apart from your course. For example, we have two courses; Analog electronics and digital electronics. Apart from that, I advise students to take up the course in semiconductor physics for the second year and the course for VLSI engineering in the third year in the EC department. Usually, students from the electrical engineering department won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have these courses, but I advise them to take these courses as additionals or electives. One more course by Professor Ashish Maity called Analog Signal Processing in the autumn semester and Mixed-Signal Processing in the spring semester. The topics discussed in these courses are directly related to the placement interviews. There is another course called SMPC, which is for power electronics profile that could prove very helpful. What was your strategy for preparation? Did you change it depending on which company you were aiming for and in between rounds? Yes, the profiles are completely different, so we have to change our strategy for preparation. For Western Digital, I revised Verilog from the online course I did and for Enphase power electronic notes. As I mentioned earlier, you also need to be updated with the latest technologies. So for that, you can follow the companies on LinkedIn or browse the companies webpages. Companies update their feed with their latest technologies. Like if you subscribe to Texas Instruments, you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll receive mail from them informing you about the latest technologies regularly. Referring to a research paper is optional, but subscribing to such companies would provide you with a good source if you wish to do so. It is generally said that there are fewer opportunities in the core sector than non-core sector. Is this the case, and is if so, what are the options we should look out for and focus on? Opportunities in core profiles are indeed minimal. I did my internships in software profile with Samsung. So I advise not to rely entirely on core profiles but also prepare for software profiles too. In software, knowledge about data structures and algorithms would be enough. This helps you in case you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get placed in a core profile. It would help if you also kept in touch with your seniors so that you are also able to apply off-campus. What advice would you like to give your juniors who will be sitting for placements this year? The only advice I would give is that be thorough with whatever your professors teach you. I have observed a lot of the juniors to be worried about placements. I would tell them that there are a lot of opportunities ahead. Even if you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get placed in campus interviews, you can always apply for off-campus ones, appear for the GATE exam, etc. You focus on what you need to do right now, and you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll get what you wish for. What would you like to say to the general KGP public out there? Any advice for them? For the time being, they should take care of themselves from COVID. Also, keep improving your interpersonal skills by engaging in hall activities. For getting experience, contact a professor and take up a project under them. You have to mail the professors and talk to them to take up a project. And there are no criteria whatsoever for taking up a project. Professors do not consider your CGPA to give you an assignment. You have to keep your concepts clear to complete the project. This would give you a significant advantage as you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll learn a lot in these activities. There will be many people learning data and programming around you, but I never really took much interest in it. I took up a project under a professor at the starting of the third year and learned everything from there.

Today we have with us Mr. Akshay Jain, who has been placed at Lam Research. Let\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s start with Akshay\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s introduction Hi there, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll just quickly introduce myself, I am Akshay Jain, and I am a final year undergraduate in the Department of Industrial and Systems Engineering, pursuing a BTech in manufacturing Sciences and an MTech in Industrial and Systems Engineering. How did you decide to go in the core profile, considering that coding and data are usually most discussed? It was something that was built upon from my first year itself. In the first year, I was involved in Robotics, and in my second year, I got involved in a research group called Aerial Robotics, where I was a hardware team member. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s where the initial foundation began. Then in my first year, the winter workshop is where I got the knack for hardware robotics. I figured that the implementation of concepts was more appealing to me than anything theoretical. So, then in our research group, we worked on designing stuff and making the hardware more reliable. So that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s where it eventually started, and after that, in my third year, I tried to pursue coding and data sciences as everybody was doing at the time, but something about that didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t resonate with me. I tried picking them again a couple of times after that, but I decided that it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not for me pretty soon. After which, I got more and more involved in robotics. Then I tried to get an internship in Canada through various programs like UARE, MITACS etc. That was usually your best shot at a respected university. Fortunately, that year, many of the students from IIT Kharagpur were selected for the internship; I was one of them. The project there was also very much related to what I had already worked in, which immensely helped build my profile. That was pretty much where I got my experience and the internship and played an essential part in the interview, in the test that I gave and finally in placement that I got. So, now that we have known all about how interesting these fields can be, even though they say Coding and Data Analytics are the best fields. Can you elaborate on the general interview process, round by round? Lam Research offered two core profiles: mechanical and electrical Firstly, they took a pen and paper test where they gave you 10 or so theoretical questions. As far as I can recall, they were not too difficult, but on the basic concepts that you study during your second and third year like heat transfer, fluid mechanics, a combination of those. A few questions from mechanics that we learn in the first year and mechanics of solids were combined in 10 questions. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d rate them as easy to moderate level. Even when it was online, you had to solve each question on a piece of paper, take a photograph of it, make a pdf of it, and upload it on the given platform. That was the only test for shortlisting. After that, I think about 10\u00e2\u20ac\u201c15 people were shortlisted for both profiles. Thank you for elaborating about the first round in such great detail. I must say our readers will get a lot of insight from this. Now can you please talk about the next rounds? Next, the shortlist was released and then in the early morning, the first interview started, and it went on for around 1 hour for each candidate where they looked into your resume, they asked you about the best project which you could describe, and the resume dictated that interview. They went in-depth on every project or project that they found relevant to the field you said you were interested in. They dug deeper into it, and they asked you theoretical questions and conceptual questions linked to your project. After they took the first round, the shortlisted people faced the next round of interview wherein it was an aggregate of the HR and tech combined. Here they asked about things like if you want to go for higher education and all. They wanted to test if we were fit for their industry. So they asked me a bunch of HR questions (Like if you could change anything in your past, what would it be?) and technical questions similar to the first interview, and that was it. There were no further rounds after that (The first was purely technical, and the second was an aggregate of HR and technical). So, I guess we have, in-depth, gone through all of the rounds, so now let us move to one common question, which is always asked. Many of us have heard that if we are going for a core Sector, our CGPA should be very high. Would you like to comment on that? I want to say that, yes, CGPA plays a vital role, I cannot emphasize that enough, but an essential aspect of getting through your interviews are the projects and actual practical knowledge of things. So, in my case, I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have a very high CGPA, but I had involvement in Research groups, Robotics and I had done a foreign internship, along with certain substantial PORs. So, even if you do not have the CGPA, you need to have the other things that balance out the difference between you and the other candidates. You need to have the knowledge and a good experience on projects. The only thing that matters more than your GPA is your ability to convince the interviewers about your other skills, knowledge, and expertise. So, would you advise that we should place experience higher than the CGPA? I am saying that there should be a good balance between both. And even if you feel that your CGPA is not good enough for going to such companies, you can always have good sufficient work experience and practical knowledge of how things work to crack it. Both items are equally important, but you need to have the other aspect equally strong if you do not have one thing. Finally, the fact remains that things become much simpler when you have a decent CGPA, so you should work for that. And in case you feel that theoretical work doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t excite you much, you can always pick up projects to learn their practical aspects. Both of the things will take you a long way if you work hard. That was quite insightful. So, our next question is that there are many resources we use while preparing, so would you like to mention some of the sources you used during preparation, online courses, books, or anything else? So, not particularly for this, because I just prepared my CV, given that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the main thing that guides the interview flow. So, I would say that you should study the core technical courses like Fluid Mechanics, Mechanics of solids and stuff, you know things like that. People usually try to dig deep into subjects thinking the questions will be very hard. But in my experience, that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not true. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve figured that the in-depth knowledge in such things is often not very useful, because they ask you basics only. And that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s where you need to be good at. Not just knowing it in theory but knowing why are they implemented. So, you need to be aware of all the basic formulas, conceptual learnings and a little practical knowledge. You need not dig too much deeper into these topics, but you need to have a good conceptual understanding of the main subjects. So, you said, we should be paying attention to the core subjects like Fluid Mechanics, Mechanics and Solids. Could you mention, apart from these, some important topics? So, heat transfer was an important topic for most of the questions they asked because my project was related to it somehow. So, there is no hard-bound set of rules that you need to follow like, this is the subject they will exactly ask from. They can ask anything. It would help if you were well versed with the topics involved in your project; for example, your project involves fluid mechanics or mechanics and solids. You only need to be aware of the basic concept and some in-depth concepts in such topics. So, I would like to ask what was your preparation strategy? So, like when the first round was over, did you change your preparation strategy? Or Did you change your preparation strategy for different companies? Yes, of course, the core sector was not the only one that I was trying for. I tried to go for management consultancy for other companies that appeared like American Express and got shortlisted in some of them. Unfortunately, the major companies that I was aiming for, like ITC and P&G, didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t come this year, so I had to work with what I had. If you talk about change in strategy for Round 1 and round 2, there wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t much. Since it was the same company, there was a change of plan between different companies, like for a core company, you have to give the CV where you have highlighted your projects. For management roles, you need a CV where your POR\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s are stressed. Oh, ok, one more question: Does POR play a part in the internships in the core sector or is it the research work? Definitely, the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcResearch Work\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 plays a significant role. I wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t say that there wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t any role of PORs because when you have a POR it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not just the certificate that matters but the experience you have with it. Your confidence to show up in an interview and your confidence to tackle the questions you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know how to answer is where your POR helps you. If you have a POR, it does not matter in terms of the certificate. Still, in terms of your overall experience to tackle difficult situations, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d say it can make a significant difference. But if you are talking strictly about what helps you during the interview, that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the research project you have done throughout your college and nothing else. So, coming to the next question, what are the opportunities in the core sector you have got this year? So, from the placement point of view, the opportunities in the core sector are minimal, not talking about the circuital cluster not CS, CC, Electrical, they get their ample opportunities in term of their core sectors, but when it comes to mechanical, civil, ocean engineering and naval architecture, biotech, the companies that visit are pretty limited. If you go further down, like for Metallurgy students, their opportunities decrease, and even the pay scale is not on par. People usually say that there are still well-paying jobs for you if you do a good amount of coding or data sciences. From what I experienced, if 90 per cent of jobs require data and coding, there are only ten jobs that would require core skills. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d say that it is still moderately better than other departments in mechanical, but overall, the non-circuit core sectors have much fewer opportunities than their coding and data counterparts. One last question would be, what advice would you like to give to your juniors who would be sitting for placement this year? I already answered this question before in the question where you asked if CGPA is essential. So, people usually give up if their CGPA is like, say, 7.5 or 7, believing that the core field is not made for them, even if they have somewhat of an inclination towards it. Often the theoretical side of things doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t make too much sense, and that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s where you start to lose interest. Still, having a practical knowledge of things, going out there and participating in competitions, attending workshops, and joining research groups can change your view towards the core field. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s what exactly happened with me, and eventually, things fell into place, I got a good amount of exposure to different experiences. But since I have been through this, I can tell you for a fact that if you are willing to do it despite the CGPA, you can make it into the core fields, but hard work in this equation remains irreplaceable. So if you are not earning your CGPA, it needs to be substituted with practical knowledge. Also, you can feel free to contact me on any platform if you need some further advice on building your core profile. Thanks a lot Akshay for such insightful advice. At last, would you like to say anything to the general KGP junta out there, any advice for them, the first and the second years? It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been a tough year for all of us, you know. All of us are just sitting at our homes, hoping for things to get better, and I hope they will. And I cannot express this enough, but once you are in KGP, I would want you to try n-number of things that widen your horizon of the things you can learn and not just take you in a single direction. I wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t tell you to go and try everything, but don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t shy away from different kinds of experiences and get out of your comfort zones. Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t go saying \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcyaar ye to nahin ho payega\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 or \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcKafi mushkil hai ye\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. Do not look at the status that these people are the only ones that get there. If you want to do something, just go for it and make sure that there are no regrets. And yeah, all the best for your future :) Back to list","category":"Placement","profile":"Core","department":"Industrial and Systems Engineering"},{"blog_id":60,"blog_text":"Vimlendu Singh Placed at Airbus Interviewed By: How did you decide to go in the core profile, considering that coding and data are usually in vogue and are most talked about? Right from my first year I was into mechatronics and had a knack for engineering. At the same time, as I went through academics, I got exposure to other areas in this particular field and finally decided to go for controls. I was also interested in the automotive sector, and it got amplified when I got some hands-on experience with research projects. Initially, I was planning to go for higher studies, but I focused on getting an industrial experience first due to uncertainties associated with the pandemic situation. Due to my profile, I got an internship at KPIT Technologies Ltd., Pune, in the automotive domain, where I learned more about hybrid electric vehicles and vehicle dynamics & control. But at the same time, I would also like to say that you can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t ignore stuff like coding and data analytics as everything is getting mixed up right now and converging at the same point. You should know a little bit of coding too, and then look for its application in your field. I also did the coding, but it was not like hard stuff coding, but it sure helped me. You should be aware of different mathematical tools and try to learn as many skills as possible. Interdisciplinary research is a new trend. What was the general interview process (number of rounds, questions asked, topics they questioned about in each round, etc.) for the companies you aimed for? The process starts with submitting a CV, followed by a test, sometimes GD, and lastly, the PI. CV is the essential part of your whole application. I can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t stress much on this. CV can outweigh all the other aspects of your application sometimes and might make the difference. Airbus is very much concerned about your CV, your prior experiences and the kind of roles you have taken, and the quality of work that you did in the past. It must align with what they are looking for in their potential candidates. Then comes the much-dreaded test, which was a little difficult for my profile which was Flight Physics. There are multiple profiles in Airbus, from which you can choose. There were many challenging questions. They are not on the level of standard aerodynamics that we learn in college. Those types of questions you can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t just study so. Those questions test the basic understanding of things. If you can score up to 50% of the total marks, then there are good chances of you getting shortlisted for interviews. The test is just a criterion if you can answer a few questions on core concepts. Companies look for prior experience. During interviews, there were two rounds: one was technical, and the other was HR. Since everything was conducted online, the experience was somewhat different. More relaxing because you were not facing them live. The technical round for me started early in the morning. The technical team won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t dive much into the details of the work you have done or details. They might, but it wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t in the case mine. I think due to time constraints, they get an overall idea of what you have done. I want to point out that you have to emphasise the outcome of your project or work. It would help if you finally had something as the result of all the work that you did. Ina brief statement, you can write what the objective of your whole project is. Then I had a conference paper they started asking about it and my contribution to it. So that was also simple. Avoid triggering the interviewers. It won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be good to dig deeper, ask tough stuff, and put you out of your comfort zone. Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t call any unnecessary problems. After this, they started to ask some technical questions. I was also a part of a research project, Airavat-(Unmanned Aerial Vehicles). They start with what you have done and asked me what I had worked on. Just get your basics right and practise them rather than doing stuff that is not relevant. Make a good understanding of basic concepts, and you have to present everything properly. Aerospace has multiple domains, and if they ask questions from different fields which you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know, say that you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know rather than saying wrong answers as it has a terrible impact on interviewers. You can also ask to shift to a domain you are familiar with. It also happened as I am from mechanical and not much familiar with the aerospace part. They would help you out and try to speak out loudly. Many of us have heard that one should aim for going into the core sector only when your CG is high. Would you like to comment on that statement? Higher CGPA won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t affect it is always going to help at the end of the day, but yes, this has been an observation that lower CGPA students have also been placed at good companies. I have seen guys with CG around 7\u00e2\u20ac\u201c8, which by the standard of KGP is not that good; they also got placed in Airbus, Jaguar and many other good companies. So having CGPA is not as good a factor. If your CV is perfect and you have great projects, it can compensate for your low CGPA as you can say at the cost of This you have good projects. Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be worried if you have low CGPA. I have seen that in the last few years, companies are not much into this CGPA. I Have seen Airbus have taken mostly eight pointers in the 7.5\u00e2\u20ac\u201c8.5 domain. I would also like to say that sometimes very high GPA will work against your profile. If you have a higher CGPA than regular companies, you tend to go for higher studies, and companies will want their employees to stay. I won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t generalise it, but yes, this is a factor also. CGPA might not be a big concern, but having less than 7 CGPA will affect you as you can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t clear companies cutoff. Airbus didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have any cutoff still; I can say around 7.5. Any resources you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d like to mention which you used while preparing? E.g.- any additionals you took, online courses, etc. A good way for resources is Coursera and different online learning platforms. We can also get references from the professor. It would help if you had a good grip on Solidworks and Matlab for the core. You can have an idea of Machine Learning. I did a minor in Mathematics and Computing. In the interview, they asked why I did a minor in Mathematics and Computing. That was something I was not expecting. I said Mathematics is used overall domains; by help, we can solve different kinds of equations. What was your strategy for preparation? Did you change it depending on which company you were aiming for and in between rounds? If you are studying correctly for the four years you have, develop some skills. If you have an overall idea of approaching a particular field, that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s enough. You should have a general idea of general questions that companies ask, say automotive; then you should have a basic automation concept and its theory. If possible, try to get some previous year question from a different company. You can refer to your seniors for screenshots or something like that of last year questions. Be mentally prepared to approach the interview; for every company, there is no hard and first rule for getting into it. We can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t rely on one source. We can go on forums, and we can get questions from students of other IIT\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s if their placement season is earlier than yours. People post questions in it. Make some short notes beforehand as you cant go through the whole textbook before interviews. Preparing too much for an interview kills your time better go through questions that have been asked previously sometimes; questions also repeat. Try to practise from previous years. What are the opportunities in the core sector? The core sector has a lot of great opportunities to offer, but at the same time, it is a lot more competitive. For placements, a relatively lesser number of companies might, and you might have to make some compromises on the job profile. As there are a limited number of vacancies, the core becomes something more challenging to get, given that all those competing are already the best minds. At the core, we can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t just sit and expect them to give you a job based on your knowledge. You also need to have prior experience. You also need to have great projects beforehand, which is most aligned with the type of profile you are applying for, and at the same time, if you have a good CGPA and you should be above average in the field, you should be competent. For Core, Sector perseverance is the key. Sometimes rewards are not instantaneous, and it takes time, compared to coding and data science profile. If you are not enjoying the thing after few years, you will be burdened with your job in the core sector. You have to be confident that you can do this particular thing. What advice would you like to give your juniors who will be sitting for placements this year? First, be clear and see what you are looking for in a job, and you have to take into account everything and which thing you want to take as a career. Once you are ready with it, it will help you achieve the goal most efficiently. Consult seniors who are at the top in their respective field. It would help if you tried to explore different domains. Try to make a good CV. Try to have a CG of above 8. What would you like to say to the general KGP public out there? Any advice for them? Have a good command of one particular language so that you can sit and qualify tests. Have a bit of coding background. Work on soft skills as it will matter in the interview as you have completed the technical round. When it comes to selecting between 2 or 3 candidates or in GD session, it will just be the soft skill the way you interact and communicate. Not having good soft skills affects selection a lot in GD and HR rounds. Your CV shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t shout you want to do a PhD. Your statements shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be contradictory. It would help if you were very firm on what you say. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s all from my side. Back to list","category":"Placement","profile":"Core","department":"Mechanical Engineering"},{"blog_id":61,"blog_text":"Abhinaba Saha Placed at Bajaj Auto Interviewed By: How did you decide to go in the core profile considering that coding and data are usually in vogue and are most talked about? I had always wanted to work in the automobile sector and that was definitely one of the reasons, I had opted for Mechanical Engineering in the first place after JEE. Also, I wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t the jack of all trades. I was a part of the Electric Vehicle Group since my 2nd year and worked there pretty much all the time. So, I had a pretty simple choice, to go forward with the work I did in the institute, mainly for the four reasons: I loved what I did! 2. I was good at it. 3. I had my CDC internship @Lear Corporation in my field of interest and got to explore it. It turned out to be tremendous and spiked up my interest in the area. 4. The field I worked in (Electric Vehicles), happened to be increasing in demand and scope. I searched for possible work scenarios in the area. What are the future opportunities if I continue with the field and whether I like it or not? Some other things you can do are: Talk to the seniors who are placed in the company of your choice: In my personal opinion, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s always good to get a first-hand insight as experience still speaks louder and more precise. You will have a better idea of the company culture, further growth opportunities within the company, types of projects and work culture, the HR team, etc. Talk to people about their internships: People generally fight for their PPO and try to get an idea about its working environment. But remember they have just interned there, which is very different from doing a job. Remember, an intern is an outsider with a slightly closer look at a company. So, I would recommend going with the point above wherever possible. What was the general interview process (number of rounds, questions asked, topics they questioned about in each round, etc.) for the companies that you aimed for? I had most of my interview shortlists in the core mechanical companies. My first interview was actually at Bajaj Auto on the eve of Day 2 as I was among the waitlisted candidates for Jaguar Land Rover which comes on Day 1. Bajaj Auto had 2 PI rounds the first round being technical and those who clear the technical interview are called for one final round which is the HR interview. A common question you can find in most interviews is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Tell me about yourself\u00e2\u20ac\u009d. The ball is in your court. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an opportunity to tell the interviewer what\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not on the resume and steer the interview in the direction of your strengths, or the areas you are confident in. Have a sweet, short story. Some people connect things they did in the past which made them the person they are today (like how you ended up here), about their skills and then end up with something on your resume if that matches the flow. Some people just have a long-ass list of their achievements. Something that can act as a foundation for the interview will work wonders, but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s okay if that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not the case; you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have to keep it sober. Then they ask questions based on your CV and here you should be able to defend each and every word which you have mentioned there. I had sufficient things to show regarding I am passionate to work in the automobile sector so most of the questions were regarding things related to what I have done at EVG & during my previous internship. Moreover, my CDC internship in pre-final year summers at Lear Corporation was also based on the design of an electric vehicle so all these definitely helped a lot. You can expect questions like what have you learnt from your previous experiences and how you would actually like to implement them if you are hired at the company. Many of us have heard that one should aim for going into the core sector only when your CG is high. Would you like to comment on that statement? CGPA happens to be the most important one (sadly) because they filter you out. A lot of companies use CGPA filtering, and being rejected just because of low CG sucks! It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s right at the top of your resume and quickly catches the eye. Some companies don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t officially mention it, but they do sort resumes on CG. But you can actually still get through if you have pretty impressive work on the resume to somewhat compensate for your low CGPA. Basically, if HR asks you why do you have a low CGPA you need to tell him a suitable reason for it. You can answer that you have done well enough in the core courses but due to a few subjects like Biology, EVS, Economics which we are kind of forced to take as a part of our curriculum might be one reason for a drop in the CGPA On the other hand, if you have a high CGPA which can range from anywhere above 9 you would definitely face the question \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Why wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t you like to pursue masters or a PhD\u00e2\u20ac\u009d? The question can be specifically challenging if you have a lot of research projects and a high CGPA. An answer to this might be you can tell you thought about it, just like everyone else in the institute. But after discussing it with seniors, with whom you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve worked for the past two years and my parents who know you well, they rightly pointed out that skills are directed more towards working in teams and actual implementation of the projects, which on introspecting made sense. Also, you wanted to explore breadth rather than depth, which isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t generally the case in research. Any resources you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d like to mention which you used while preparing? Eg- any additionals you took, online courses, etc. I was an active member of the Electric Vehicle Group, IIT KGP which I have been a part of since my 2nd year. The practical experience I gained from there helped me a lot in developing sufficient knowledge regarding automobiles. I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t use any special resources for preparation. I just used to read things that will bring in some clarity and fill in my knowledge gaps. Question sets from the GATE entrance exam are a good resource for core mechanical Engg. practice. For almost all the core companies they conduct a test which you need to clear to even get shortlisted for the PI round. I was also preparing for my CAT exam which usually happens just before placements so it helped me with the problems in the Quants section. You should have one particular field of engineering you know in some depth (like Design, Thermo, Controls, etc.) Having a peer group to prepare along with helps a lot. We used to divide topics among ourselves for core prep, learn the specific topics, and sit together at night to teach their subjects and discuss them. What was your strategy for preparation? Did you change it depending on which company you were aiming for and in between rounds? For every company, you need to have a different mindset as the job profile in every company is different. On Day 2 itself, I had 2 interviews (Bajaj Auto and Alphonso). The extended shortlist of Alphonso arrived when I was actually having my technical round at Bajaj Auto and within 10 minutes time, I had to be mentally prepared and adapt myself accordingly for my interview @Alphonso which was actually based on a completely different profile. So for every company you need to know what questions might be asked in that interview, you need to find out from people(mostly seniors) what is the kind of preparation that you need to have and accordingly you need to change your strategy. Having a predefined strategy for each company is definitely beneficial. The rest of my interview shortlists were on Day 3-Mercedes Benz R&D, Caterpillar & Sterlite. But since I had already accepted my offer I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t sit in the PI rounds of any of these companies What are the opportunities in the core sector? One might consider opportunities in the core sector are less but I feel they are actually not less but they are actually not that rewarding for the first few years in your company. So, people tend to have a wrong intuition that trying to land a job in the core field is tough so I would like to add that there are many companies which provide you with enough remuneration. What advice would you like to give your juniors who will be sitting for placements this year? Just be confident of the matter in your CV, and defend it earnestly. Look the interviewer in the eye, and speak, in fact, brag, to an extent elucidating why you would like to work for the firm. Never ever go anywhere near mentioning anything that is even remotely your weak point, anything that you have even the slightest of doubts about conceptually, the interviewer can pick a hole and tear you apart from a speck of hesitation and doubt. Always try to guide the discussion, especially in technical rounds, towards topics of your strength, and stick to it. The interviewers have your CV in hand, so they will naturally try to pull you into your projects and internships, so prepare your CV well, so in the first place prepare your CV in a way that you are sure of explaining and defending. What would you like to say to the general KGP public out there? Any advice for them? While listening to your heart minimizes regrets, thinking about the repercussions might benefit you in the long term. Emotions are temporary, but consequences can be permanent. Talk to the people who have worked there. People who have nothing to do with you and people who know you well are the ones who will give you unbiased opinions. After listening to all of them, you are the judge. Say you have two offers to accept, which one would you choose. Say A is paying you more than B, but you value your work life, and after talking to a guy you know in A, you realize A has a shitty work life. You have your answer! Another thing I would like to go with is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Prospects.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d Some companies pay you less but have a great brand value. You can always choose to use the experience and their name for a higher paying job later. And finally, RELAX, GUYS! This is just your first job. You have many more opportunities to come. Do the best you can and embrace whatever comes your way. You guys have the grit that brought you here. You can do anything if you decide to do so. Also, your soft skills matter a lot to get you through. You can be a pro in technical stuff and screw up your interview like a pro just because you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know how to talk to people. Job is about working with people. So better work on them. Build up the competency you need to get the job; you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be okay. HAVE A GREAT PLACEMENT EXPERIENCE! And after you grab what you wanted, PEACE OUT!

Thank you, Sadhvika! let\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s have a discussion How did you decide to go in the core profile considering that coding and data are usually in vogue and are most talked about? From my first year itself, I wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t interested in coding. I was somewhat interested in Engineering drawing and mechanics. Based on this, I decided to stay in my department though I was getting chemical and industrial after the first year. I started liking my department courses during my second year. Hence I decided to develop a core profile. I was sure to not go for a non-core profile as I wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t very interested in coding, and it is an essential requirement for most of the non-core field placement. What was the general interview process(number of rounds, questions asked, topics they questioned about each round, etc.) for the companies that you aimed for? The company that I got placed in, i.e. Tata Projects Ltd., was hiring students from 4 departments, namely Chemical, Mechanical, Electrical and Civil Engineering. There were three rounds. First, there was a presentation which we had to attend. Then they shortlisted our CVs, and the last round was the interview round. The presentation is an introduction to the company. We are explained about their ongoing projects, what the company does, what services they provide. Like any other company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ppt, they told us more about the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s history and the achievements of our Alumni who were placed in the company. At least one of the interviewers will undoubtedly be knowledgeable in your specific field in the interview round. So one should be well prepared to face questions regarding the department courses. Students are also asked about the extracurricular activities they have participated in. Though it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not a requirement, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a plus point. They will surely ask for the details about the PORs one has mentioned in the CV. All the department courses are essential for getting placed in a core company; some specific topics need to focus more on. I had talked to my senior who was placed in this company. He advised me to study an elective that most civil engineering students take up, Construction Planning and Management. General questions were asked. Some basic knowledge about this course is enough. Many of us have heard that one should aim for going into the core sector only when your CG is high. Would you like to comment on that statement? Participating actively in any activity during the 4 or 5 years spent at KGP will make anyone more confident about themselves. One can be sure enough to put in extra effort and hard work to get an internship and a job. Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be demotivated because of your CGPA. Be clear about which field you are interested in. Many of my friends not having a CGPA of more than 7.5 also got placed in core and non-core jobs. If one is not selected in the placement rounds, he can go for engineering services. It is considered to be one of the best jobs in the core field. So there are plenty of options in the core field and no one should let go of this chance because of their CGPA. Any resources you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d like to mention which you used while preparing? Eg-any additionals you took, online courses, etc. In my opinion, if one wishes to get into the core field, he should be confident in the departmental courses. Nothing more, Nothing less. You don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t require any other course. Most of the questions asked are based on the subjects taught in the 2nd and 3rd year. Hence to crack the interview round one needs to have an understanding of those subjects. If you have a CGPA greater than 8, you need not worry about the placement. Just continue studying at the same pace. What was your strategy for preparation? Did you change it depending on which company you were aiming for and in between rounds? I was preparing for Engineering Services before placement. When the placement procedure started, I decided to give it a try. I hadn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t spent much time preparing specifically for placement. Most of my friends had started preparing in the 3rd year itself, but I started preparing just a month before. Before the placement procedure, one can revise some mathematics and Quant, at least the part which is required for the test. A CGPA higher than 8.5 will give you an edge over others and is enough to get into a core company. What are the opportunities in the core sector? There are many opportunities in the core sector. In 2019, the Coal India company started holding the placement rounds in the 2nd phase. One of our seniors also got placed in it. Being a PSU, the company is considered a perfect opportunity. One must have a little patience during the placement process. After the placement, one can even try UPSC. If aiming for a government job, GATE and engineering services are good options. Further studies can be obtained abroad. If you are working hard in any field, you will always find many opportunities. I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think it is challenging to get a core job. What would you like to say to the general KGP public out there? Any advice for them? If they are in their 2nd year, I would advise not to worry much about placements at this point. They should pursue the things that interest them. It may include being a part of any society or participating in any social, cultural or hall activity. They can also participate in competitions like inter IIT. There are various such options at KGP. In the third year, they can learn new things which can be presented in the CV. If a student is enrolled in the four year B-tech course, he must make sure he bags an internship off-campus in the third year vacation. If not an internship, they must at least contribute to a project under a professor. A lot of 2nd students get training in their summer. That is also an excellent opportunity to get hands-on experience in the practical world. One will understand the requirements of a company and practical implementation of the knowledge gained. It does not matter where you are doing an internship or a project. What matters is how much of an effort you put into the work you do. I hadn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t applied for any off-campus internship during the CDC internship procedure. I thought that I can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t find a core field internship. So I contributed to a project under a professor of the Civil Engineering Department. The project was based on machine learning. Since it was used in around four fields, I found the project very captivating. Finally, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d say placements should not be the only goal. One must try everything at KGP. Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t miss out on anything. This chance won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t fall across our paths every day. Back to list","category":"Placement","profile":"Core","department":"Civil Engineering"},{"blog_id":63,"blog_text":"Diwakar Swaroop Placed at Lam Research Interviewed By: Sadhvika Hello Diwakar! This is Sadhvika from Communiqu\u00c3\u00a9. Heartiest congratulations on being placed at Lam Research. If I have your consent may I take a short interview with you? Thank you Sadhvika! Yeah sure, let\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s have a discussion. Please go ahead. How did you decide to go in the core profile considering that coding and data are usually in vogue and are most talked about? I had a liking for core mechanical engineering from the beginning itself, which did not change at any stage. I also knew about the various on-campus\/ off-campus opportunities available in the domain. I had the interest and the confidence to excel as well, therefore, there was no reason I switched to other profiles. What was the general interview process (number of rounds, questions asked, topics they questioned about in each round, etc.) for the companies that you aimed for? Most of the technical companies have similar interview processes. The first round is the technical round which generally takes about an hour. In this round, they cover up much of the whole mechanical course curriculum. The second round is the HR round but they did ask some Engineering intuitive questions in the interview of LAM Research and it took about 20\u00e2\u20ac\u201c30 mins. Regarding written rounds: For Bajaj, we had the aptitude and core-based questions in MCQ format. The questions asked were theory-based, no numerical and relatively easier than others. The questions asked for the written round of placement for Lam were the most challenging and different according to me. The questions were subjective and were to be handwritten and uploaded in a portal that was provided. They had 8\u00e2\u20ac\u201c9 questions to be solved in about 90 mins or so. The questions weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t routine and they checked how strong your basics and application of concepts are. The second round is the interview round. Here I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d like to mention one thing that is even though my interview with Jaguar went very well, I wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t selected. The reason being that they had less vacancy and they preferred other candidates who had exposure in the domain of the automobile through some research group or research project they had been a part of. Bajaj also needs candidates with previous experience in that field. So my advice is that if you wish to join this field you should take an initiative to be a part of a research group or take a research project in this field. Many of us have heard that one should aim for going into the core sector only when your CG is high. Would you like to comment on that statement? A good CGPA helps a lot. They are important for you to get selected for the interview round as the companies consider it along with the test scores. So above 8 is good enough, and above 8.5 would be a great place to be. Having said that the people with an average CG may also get shortlisted but make sure you have a good reason for it. Like you could back it up with a research project saying that you were more focused on gaining practical knowledge and such. Any resources you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d like to mention which you used while preparing? Eg- any additionals you took, online courses, etc. In my opinion, there is no need for additional courses because the college course curriculum covers everything you need. So if you are thorough with the curriculum then you will be able to crack the general placement process in the core. The additionals offered are very specific for a certain field and if you are preparing for a general core placement, then the course curriculum is your key. Taking additionals should solely be one\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s own choice, based on the interest they have. Here I would also mention that many ignore their 1st and 2nd-year basic courses but they are the conceptual foundation, questions based on these are also asked in the interviews as well. So when you prepare for the placement I would advise you to revise all the concepts from your 1st year itself. It is not necessary to take up additional courses or any online material. Your course curriculum would be sufficient for the theory part. You should revise your concepts from a reference book because I believe that reading helps in better understanding and retaining the knowledge for a long time. And if you have taken up research or an internship you might need to learn software or two which you could from the many videos available on youtube and any other online platform. What was your strategy for preparation? Did you change it depending on which company you were aiming for and in between rounds? First of all do not aim for just a single company and put all your energy behind it. You should aim for a set of 5 to 6 companies you wish to get into and focus on them and prepare accordingly so you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t panic at the last moment. So my strategy was to prepare short notes of the topics as I revised them so that I could recollect all of them at the end. So in the last semester that is the placement semester I started preparing in this way and in 2\u00e2\u20ac\u201c3 months I had covered up all the core engineering subjects and I had all the short notes ready with me. So whenever I had a test for a certain company it was very easy for me to revise the topics relevant to the profile of the company. It is generally said that there are fewer opportunities in the core sector than non-core sector. Is this the case and is if so what are the opportunities we should look out for and focus on? There are many opportunities in the core sector though they may be less in the campus placements, there are many out of it. You can always get very good PSU jobs through GATE and you get into government sectors through engineering services examinations. Apart from that, there are examinations conducted for ISRO, DRDO, BARC, and so on. So opportunities are there. We just need to explore and have an open mind towards it. How often do we get an opportunity to work on a research project under a professor on the campus? It truly depends on the professor. Like some professors who are quite reputed for their research in the department, they like to take students early. They would have students under them from the second year itself. It would be difficult to get a project under them in the later years. So you could approach them in the second year itself when you are well acquainted with a few core topics and learn your interests. But yes, BTPs and MTPs are also a very good option since 2 years is also enough to get a good yield project in the core. BTPs and MTPs are not difficult to get under a professor of your choice, but it is always advisable to start early on. To get a good project, you should first check the profile of the professor and learn what his field of research is. This can be easily learned by the institutes\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 webpage for the faculty department. And then you need to explore a bit on your own so that you are properly acquainted with it and make sure the research is relevant to the industry. So now when you approach a professor saying you are interested in his research and wish to work under him, seeing that you are well informed about the project, you have significant chances of securing the opportunity. You should also take initiative from the beginning itself to get the best out of the professor because several students are working under him. So he would focus on you only if you show interest in it. Some of the professors also consider your CGPA but not many. So if you show a real interest in the domain, CGPA shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be a problem. What advice would you like to give your juniors who will be sitting for placements this year? I would advise them to focus on the thing under their control. With the circumstances of today, a lot of things might feel uncertain and chaotic. So keeping your focus is very important. Like for example, I had expected to get into ISRO as it had been visiting our campus in the past few years but at the last moment, I was informed that it wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t visit the campus this year. So in this situation, you should try to focus on the fact that you still haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t lost the opportunity and you have a lot of time to prepare and things like that. Because your efforts and hard work will never be wasted and will always pay off well. What is your opinion on taking an internship in the second year? Considering the time we all are facing I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m sure how possible it would be to get an internship in the core industry and that too for a second year. The reason being the restricted mobility now. But even if you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have an internship, you can always approach a professor. Working under a professor in the second year is very underrated when it is a great opportunity to get an insight into the core domain that not many of your peers would have. In my opinion, it is the best possible use of your time. What would you like to say to the general KGP public out there? Any advice for them? I would like to say that you need to maintain a balance in your life. Academics are important but so is socializing and developing your personality and making friends for life while on campus. As you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re not only going to take a degree with you but also the memories of the years of your life spent here, to cherish for a lifetime. So be a better judge of yourself to know the right time to do what. When you will be able to judge yourself, that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s when you will enjoy your life here to the fullest and never regret what you did. Back to list","category":"Placement","profile":"Core","department":"Mechanical Engineering"},{"blog_id":64,"blog_text":"Pankaj Mishra Placed at McKinsey Interviewed By: Secretary Today we have Pankaj Mishra with us who has been placed at Mckinsey. So first heartiest Congratulations on that. Pankaj please tell us about the general interview process for the companies you interviewed? Please mention the number of rounds and the nature of the interview process. Thanks a lot. For Mckinsey, the shortlisting process was different from the general CDC process because you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t apply through CDC. Instead, you get an email from Mckinsey asking you to apply directly on their website. So all you need to do is submit your CV and fill out the questionnaire on the website. Once you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve applied, in a week or so you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll get an email revealing whether you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been shortlisted for the interviews or not. This time some 20 folks were shortlisted. The shortlisted candidates are allotted two buddies from the company. These buddies are employees working for Mckinsey. In my case, one of them was an analyst and the other was an associate. After you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been shortlisted, there are around 14 days before your interviews start. During this period, you are supposed to talk to your buddies, try and understand how Mckinsey works and whether you will be a right fit for the company or not. You can talk to your buddies about pretty much anything that you want to know or are curious about because it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s non-evaluative. This includes things like the career growth for an analyst, the exit opportunities and the compensation. You should also try and understand the company culture and what is expected from an analyst. That\u00e2\u20ac\u02dcs what most of my buddy conversations revolved around. Sometimes in this phase, you also have to go through a digital assessment, which is a proprietary gamified assessment Mckinsey has developed that judges your problem-solving skills. The assessment is a necessary part of the process, but as far as I understood, the assessment score would only play a role if you are on the edge. So long as you clear the interviews by a sufficient margin, the scores shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t matter. The evaluation process begins with 2 interviews for each candidate. These are taken either by associates or engagement managers which is one level above the associates. If someone makes it past the 2 interviews, they proceed to the partner round. So to get an offer from the firm, you need to clear a total of 4 interviews. Could you please list down the questions you were asked in the different rounds? Cases, HR Discussions, or puzzles in general that you think will prove to be helpful for students. The first two interviews were fairly standard case interviews. However, compared to the typical case interviews (from what I found on YouTube), at McKinsey, they were a lot more conversational, not just in terms of asking for clarification on data or questions but the whole process, in general, felt a lot more like a discussion than an interview. Throughout the interview, it felt like they put a lot more emphasis on establishing a rapport with you and tackling the problem as a team, which was in contrast to the interviews for software roles where the interview is almost single-handedly driven by the candidate with very little input from the interviewer after sharing the initial question._x000D_\nMy first interview was about an IT giant that was trying to digitize the infrastructure of a client which was a healthcare company working across the country. This meant transforming all the company data to digital format for easier access and analysis. The main objective was to determine the right processes to make this transformation as secure as possible from malicious actors that might attempt to steal or gain unauthorized access to the data lakes. The interviewer asked me to list down all the possible things that could go wrong in such a scenario, elaborate on each one of them and that was it. This was followed by a puzzle about calculating the number of matches that need to be conducted in a knock-out tournament until you find a winner. That was it for my first interview. I was told that it would last 40\u00e2\u20ac\u201c45min, but mine got over in about 30 mins._x000D_\nThe second interview was quite similar. It was about a baby food company trying to expand its presence in the country, gain market share and increase its revenue in the process. Again the interviewer wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t focused on or expected a specific answer that he already had in mind. Instead, he picked up the recommendations I gave and drilled further into each of them. He wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t trying to push me in any particular direction and was quite excited to see all the different directions I took to tackle the problem at hand. With that, the second interview was also over._x000D_\nWithin a few hours of the second interview, I received an email informing me that I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d been shortlisted for the second round of interviews with the partners. The partner round was undeniably a lot more relaxed and chilled out. In both the interviews I felt absolutely no pressure as the interviewers did a great job at making you feel comfortable in their presence. The problems in this round were even more open-ended and I would be hard-pressed to even call them a real case interview._x000D_\nMy first interviewer in this round was a partner with expertise in IT services and digitization. So naturally, he asked me a question about an IT services giant that was trying to expand its business in the country. The goal was not to come up with a very low-level, technical solution. The interviewer was more interested in the breadth rather than the depth of my solution. So recommendations like providing after-market customer care, providing deployment solutions were better received than purely technical recommendations such as adopting new frameworks and technologies. This was followed by an easy numerical problem on calculating the time required to hit some predetermined revenue target given the individual revenue each client brings in._x000D_\nA few hours later on the same day, I had my second interview. It was taken by Aditya Sharma who I believe takes most of the final interviews for KGP. This interview was extremely informal and very pleasant. It started with brief introductions from both of us and why I wanted to work for Mckinsey. He asked a couple of questions on why consulting as well as a few other fairly standard HR questions like \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the most challenging thing you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve done in life\u00e2\u20ac\u009d. So even though the questions were quite generic, the focus was not just on the content of your answers but also on you as an individual. From what I was told later, the objective of these interviews is also to gauge the type of person you are, and whether you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d be a good fit for the team. The work hours for consultants are extremely brutal and they put a lot of emphasis on bringing in only those people who they feel would mesh well with the team._x000D_\nOnce this part of the interview was over, we started with a case that again wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t structured in any specific manner. It was about the Indian Government attempting to boost tourism and reach and eventually surpass, pre-pandemic levels as soon as possible. In short, what would you do to attract more tourists from all over the world? Here the conversation quickly took a candid turn and we started discussing what our country could do to improve its image on a global level and attract people from different parts of the world. He analysed the depth of my argument for each recommendation I pitched with a lot of cross-questioning. Finally, the most exciting part of the interview was a guesstimate to find the number of credit card users in India. It was the most fun part of the entire process because it had the right balance of logic and intuition. That was the end of the fourth interview and the entire interview process for McKinsey. What are some of the FAQs in most companies that you faced and think students must prepare for? More specifically, in the context of HR rounds. One common question they asked in three interviews out of the four was to introduce myself. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d say consulting isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t so much about problem-solving as it is about being able to express your ideas clearly and in a lucid manner. Of course, they do require you to be adept at problem-solving too, but I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d say most KGPians would already be good enough to clear their bar without any extra preparation. However, when they ask you to introduce yourself, they are not expecting you to introduce yourself as you would in KGP\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s orientation programs. They genuinely want to know you as a person. So tell them something that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not immediately obvious or written on your resume, share your interests and what makes you. What they are looking for is someone they would want to have on their team. In my case, I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t talk about my resume at all as they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d have already gone through that before the interview. I told them about my interests in biology and cultural history; something that they wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t expect from a typical engineering candidate. One of my interviewers was also really interested in biology and computer science, and these shared interests quickly helped me establish a rapport with them. So be authentic and tell them about your real motivations and interests. They also want to know if you are genuinely excited about joining McKinsey or is it just another company you are appearing for as part of the placements. So it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a good idea to spend some time and list down what aspects of consulting genuinely excite you. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no reason to pretend as the interviewers are experts at identifying bullshit answers. As long as you are being genuine, the HR questions are relatively straightforward to tackle._x000D_\nSometimes people think that their \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcgenuine\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 answers aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t good enough for the interview, but that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not true. Even if the motive is just to get a well-paying job, you can always look around on the internet and see what the job entails. Being genuine does not mean you have to be an ardent enthusiast or extremely passionate about consulting as a career. You can always identify what parts of the job excite and resonate with you *after* applying for the job. What are things students sitting for placements next year can do from now until December to maximize their chances of getting through a company in consulting? I am not sure if this is going to be a good answer because from what I have heard, McKinsey is the only consulting company that has this casual-ish case interview structure where the focus is on evaluating your personality as much as the answers you come up with. Most of the other companies usually tend to focus on the case itself and don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t concern themselves much with other things._x000D_\nIf we talk only about McKinsey, then one of the biggest things one can do to clear these interviews would be to improve your communication skills. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d say that is the most important skill they are looking for, maybe even more than your problem-solving skills._x000D_\nMany people I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve interacted with share this sentiment, with numerous instances where folks who were never really targeting consulting roles crack these interviews not because they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d been practising cases for a long time, but because they polished their communication skills over the years. Being able to structure your thoughts and make it easy for others to comprehend them is a seriously underrated skill. So practice communication more than anything else, that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d be my one piece of advice. How did your preparation for Case rounds evolve once you were shortlisted, please let us know about the resources you used as well? I hadn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t prepared for case interviews per se because consulting was never my primary goal. But after I was shortlisted, I had 2 mock case interviews with my buddies, and I felt that was sufficient. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d say as long as you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve done a couple of cases, you should be good to go because it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not the problem-solving skills that we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re lacking, but the ability to structure and lay down our thoughts and ideas in a proper manner. I struggled a lot in my very first mock interview because even though the problem itself wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t very challenging, I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know how to sequence my suggestions and tailor them so that they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d follow the next seamlessly. What we need to work on is how to think about ideas and structure them so that they are not all over the place, and a few mock cases are more than enough to help with that._x000D_\nComing to the resources, I used this book called Case in Point: Complete Case Interview Preparation Book by Marc Cosentino which was a recommendation from my buddy. I feel all the things I talked about just now like structuring your thoughts and improving the clarity are beautifully explained there. Anything else that you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d want to share with the students? Somehow people have this notion that consulting is this top-tier job that is elusive to most folks. But I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think that is the case. Like I said earlier, consulting is all about being able to express your thoughts in a structured form which makes it easy to understand for the masses. So if you want to grab a consulting job, it would be better to focus on these skills that matter during the interview._x000D_\nComing to the shortlisting process, I am not an authority on what sort of a resume will be shortlisted and what others would be rejected. But I do feel that the general pattern that these firms follow is shortlisting candidates that have demonstrated excellence in any one particular aspect of their life. I had zero PORs, and neither was I part of any societies or clubs. But I still managed to get shortlisted and I think that is because my resume was loaded with technical experience and achievements. Multiple internship experiences, along with open-source contributions through programs like GSoC helped my resume stand out from the crowd. On the other hand, there were just as many, if not more shortlisted candidates who didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have any technical experience but had a lot of leadership experience through societies, clubs and PORs. So as long as you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re doing exceptionally well in any one particular field, you should be good to go. This should also come as a respite for people who didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really join any societies early on but still want to get into consulting: PORs are not the end of the line._x000D_\nAnother thing I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d want to stress on is the difference between good communication skills and fluency, something I see being conflated a lot on campus. People assume that having good communication skills is the same as being an expert in English, but that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not true. While being fluent in English can be an advantage, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not a prerequisite for developing decent communication skills. The idea of communication is to be able to express your thoughts and ideas in a manner such that they are easily understood by the other person, that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s it. Even if you take small gaps or take some time to come up with your words, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s perfectly okay. Just because someone speaks a lot faster than another person, does not always mean they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re conveying a proportionately greater amount of information through their words._x000D_\nThat\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s all from my side. Feel free to reach out to me on LinkedIn or through the mail for any more questions. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d be happy to help. All the best for placements! Thank you so much Pankaj for joining us and for telling us about your experience. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll surely be very helpful for all of the KGP junta.

I am Ankit Ranjan from communiqu\u00c3\u00a9. First of all, a big congratulations for making it into Fractal Analytics. Please tell us about the general interview process for the companies you interviewed? Please mention the number of rounds and the nature of the interview process. Thank you. There are three rounds of the interviews before which, they conduct a test to shortlist around 40 students. This year, 42 students were shortlisted based on it. There are a total of 62 questions in this test (2 hours test), four of which are coding problems and the rest are puzzles, math, or English questions. After you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been shortlisted, you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll go through three rounds of interviews. The first two rounds can be interchanged. One round is related to business acumen to understand how much business understanding you have and the second is a tech-related interview. To the best of my understanding, there are two different types of interview processes. One is if you are into tech, and the other is if you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have much experience in tech. If you are not a techie, they will ask you some guesstimates or puzzles and will not get too much into tech; however, if you have a tech on your resume, they will focus more on the tech part, as was the case for me. In the first round, I was questioned about one of my internships at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange by a data analyst lead for one of the fractal\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s teams. He was eager to understand how I learnt the financial concepts I needed during the project and how the tech implementation was done. They took around 15\u00e2\u20ac\u201c20 minutes to discuss the CME project, and after that, they asked questions about my basic understanding of python. Then, I had a second round, after a break of 5\u00e2\u20ac\u201c10 minutes. The second round was more of a tech. In this round, they didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t ask standard DSA Questions, instead, they focused on deeper questions on machine learning at least this was the case for me. As Fractal has a lot of roles, they ask a variety of questions. For me, they took examples of ensemble learning algorithms and asked me about their working. So I had to give them a brief explanation of the algorithm, and the Mathematics behind it. Post this they quizzed me on a different project from my CV, which was my university of Iowa internship and then they asked me about what kind of data structures I had worked on, how did I implement that algorithm and what were things I was thinking of while implementing them. They were more interested to test my understanding of the math involved rather than the implementation of the algorithm. So, this was my second round of the interview. And my entire third round was devoted to discussing my reason for pursuing analytics after earning an undergraduate degree in Geology, as well as what I had done to prepare myself for the analytics sector. Since you mentioned your project at the University of Iowa, I just wanted to know how significant is it to have a project from a reputed foreign university? No, I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think that it is very important. As I told that Fractal\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s interview process is more focused on the resume, right, and it depends on the interviewer as well. So in the first round, my CME group internship was more interesting for them. In the second round, it was my university of Iowa Project. So, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not specifically about the research internship that I am talking about but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more about the work that the interviewer is doing and how it is related to the work that I have done. And of course, adding a research internship and research project to your CV shows that you are more deeply into working on research-based projects, so they are expecting more of this from you. And since my project also focused on my ML work and which is why they asked a lot of questions on it. Though you have already mentioned the types of questions they ask, I want to ask in particular if there are puzzles or more HR questions in the different rounds of the interview? As I mentioned, my first round contained business understanding questions. Since my intern at CME required a lot of business understanding, my interviewer didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t go into the puzzle and guestimate side of the interview process but one can easily expect guesstimates in the Fractal interview. How did you prepare for the interview? Any valuable advice that you would like to share? As previously stated, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more of a CV based interview, so you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have to prepare any different sorts of skills. They don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t expect you to know SQL or DSA, if you have several machine learning internships as well as PORs (as in my case), then you are good to go with Fractal, you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have to prepare specific technical aspects. However, you should have a solid understanding of machine learning algorithms and be familiar with guesstimates and puzzles. So you should know some basic case prep and machine learning aspects (for tech) and you should do more puzzles, guesstimates and case prep (for non-tech). Since you mentioned the importance of CV in Fractal, can you suggest what should be mentioned in the CV to make it stand apart from the general public? I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not familiar with Fractal\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s real shortlisting procedure. So, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not sure how they chose you. Most likely, my test score was the deciding factor in my selection. And for the things to be mentioned in my CV, like for the tech role, I had a corporate internship, a research internship and I do have several hackathons mentioned and apart from these tech-mentions, I do have several good PORs including that of a Hall President, Society Head and Governor. So, I would suggest trying to mention some PORs in your CV which is significant on the campus and apart from this try to put more tech into it. If you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have any tech experience, you can still get into Fractal by having a POR-focused CV and performing well in guesstimates. However, they do examine technical skills in your CV. So, try to include more tech in your CV, along with a few PORs that you believe are important on campus. Can you suggest some strategies or resources that can be helpful for preparation for the tech domain? For the tech aspect, there are two different things that I know. One is on the DSA part \u00e2\u20ac\u201d you should be doing basic DSA beforehand. This is a compulsion for every interview process, whether it is fractal or any other company. I would recommend that you take any DSA course. There are various resources for learning DSA, thus I won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t go into detail about them. So, one tip from my side is that you should be well-versed in DSA. There are numerous domains in machine learning, such as natural language processing (NLP), computer vision, etc. In machine learning, I had an internship in statistical learning. I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t go into Deep Learning or Natural Language Processing, but I did mention it in every interview. In a machine learning interview, they want to know how much you know about the algorithm and mathematics behind it. So, for that, the first and the basic course that needs to be done is the Andrew NG course. Apart from that, I would suggest stat quest lectures on youtube. Statquest lectures are very beneficial and will give a better understanding of machine learning and its practical application. That is what they expect from you. Just do two internships or projects on machine learning and learn the basic course on machine learning. Like I did Udemy A-Z, Andrew NG course and apart from that, Statquest lectures and several hands-on projects on Kaggle. As a pre-final year student, what can students do to maximize their chances of successful placement, especially if they have not done any internship till now and not got PPO? For those pre-final year students two-three things I would suggest. But these solutions will help you if you are sure of going into tech. Firstly, be very thorough with your DSA prep. So, start practising DSA, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an important step for any internship and placement. If you are done with DSA then I am pretty sure that you would be landing up in a good job and I believe that 3 to 4 months of DSA would help you in getting a good placement. But you have to be very dedicated to it. Apart from that since my interest was in machine learning among all domains in tech, what I did was just one or two internships in machine learning and had a basic understanding of what machine learning is. So this is how I prepared for my placements and I would also recommend that if you want to go into analytics, then these are the things that will help you in getting a good job. One more thing students preparing for the analytics domain are often unsure how much they should emphasize on doing competitive programming. Any advice on that? The point is for the test you need DSA. Four coding questions are being asked in Fractal for the shortlisting process. So DSA knowledge is a must to clear it. DSA is not just about competitive programming, but it is the problem-solving skill that you have. So if you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have anything in your CV, then the interviewer needs to know how good of a problem-solver you are, and this is how they prefer to check. From my perspective, you can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be completely into machine learning without knowing DSA. I am not asking you to do competitive programming on code forces and all but if you have done basic 400\u00e2\u20ac\u201c500 questions from InterviewBit or LeetCode, then it would suffice. So if you are looking for an analytics domain, you have to do coding to get placed at good companies. So for getting into good companies like Fractal, you need to have a good knowledge of DSA. Do you have any other suggestions for students preparing for placements this year? I think there may be a lot of students facing the same problems during placement that I faced. I couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t decide which profile I should choose. So, I prepared for product management, analytics and coding as well. I was into various profiles. Hence I would suggest that you can follow any profile that you want but to secure your job then you should know how to code. If you want to take risks, you can directly work on product management or whatever you want to do. But if you want to get into a tech role, then coding is a must. Once coding is done then 80% of your work is done for placement. So according to me, coding is very important for getting into a good company if you are into tech or unsure about the profile to pursue. Thank you so much Sumit for your time. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll surely be very helpful for all of the KGP junta preparing for analytics profile. Thanks a lot for giving this interview to Communiqu\u00c3\u00a9 IIT Kharagpur and we wish you all the very best for all your future endeavours. Thank you!

So we are here to interview him regarding his preparations and strategies to crack the interview of this company. So firstly What was the general interview process for the companies you interviewed also Please mention the number of rounds and the nature of the interview process. I interviewed only for BCG. The interview process consisted of 2 rounds as evaluative buddy rounds followed by 4 rounds of interviews on the final day. The first 2 rounds on the D-Day were strictly case rounds, where one case was Math heavy and another one was around Qualitative judgment. The last 2 rounds had both fit and case, where cases were easier and non-calculative but there was a fair amount of focus on HR Questions and Personality judgment. Thanks Divyam for explaining the general interview process. Now can you please list down the questions you were asked in the different rounds? Cases, HR Discussions, or puzzles in general that you think will prove to be helpful for students. Yes, Sure. The questions for the cases were_x000D_\n1. Guesstimate the Number of ATMs in Dubai_x000D_\n2. Indian Public Equities Optimal Portfolio Allocation for a long-haul investment strategy_x000D_\n3. Profitability of a Steel Manufacturer_x000D_\n4. Market Share Expansion Strategy for OLA Electric Scooters._x000D_\nAnd for HR discussion the questions were_x000D_\n1. Easiest and Hardest Internships and learnings from the same_x000D_\n2. Most Challenging aspect of being in the Placement Committee during a pandemic_x000D_\n3. Steps you would follow to set up a soft skills club at IIT Bombay. That would be helpful Coming to the next question What are some of the FAQs in most companies that you faced and think students must prepare for? More specifically, in the context of HR rounds. For FAQs, I think one must prepare for Why they want to enter Management Consulting, Why that specific firm, about their strengths and weaknesses, and briefs of their PoR and Internship experiences. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rightly said, so the next question is What are things students sitting for placements next year can do from now until December to maximize their chances of getting through a company in consulting? I would recommend students to start case prep early, also developing soft skills usually takes a long amount of time, aspirants can take conscious efforts towards improvement of interview personality, spoken English, and confidence. Surely, your advice will be really valuable for all of us. so coming to our last question of the day. How did your preparation for Case rounds evolve once you were shortlisted, please let us know about the resources you used as well? Yes the resources which one can use are:-_x000D_\n1. Books_x000D_\n1.1 Case Interviews Cracked_x000D_\n1.2 DayOne_x000D_\n1.3 Wharton 2010 Casebook( only some relevant parts)_x000D_\n1.4 Some handful cases\/guesstimates from IIMA\/L and ISB CaseBooks_x000D_\n2. Videos_x000D_\n2.1 Case Interviews Cracked Webinars_x000D_\n2.2 Aaditya Agarwal mock case videos_x000D_\nAnd I regarding the strategy I would like to say that:-_x000D_\n1. It is critical to focus on learnings from each case rather than solving more cases. I spent at least 30\u00e2\u20ac\u201c40 mins with the case after solving it with the case partner, in the analysis, I would spend time on understanding how the case could have been done faster\/better and would check the strength of my structure by testing it for root causes other than the one that was the case._x000D_\n2. I used to keep a note of my strengths\/weaknesses of each case and used to read these notes twice daily for all the cases_x000D_\n3. Doing cases with multiple partners, especially alumni helped me to develop as an interviewee, and would recommend students to do cases with at least 4-To 5 different interviewers. Thank you Divyam, for giving your precious time for this interview to Communiqu\u00c3\u00a9 IIT Kharagpur. I hope your interview will help the students in their endeavours and we wish you all the best for your future achievements. Thank you!

So we are here to interview him regarding his preparations and strategies to crack the interview of this company. So firstly what was the general interview process for the companies you interview also Please mention the number of rounds and the nature of the interview process. So I interviewed for the Boston Consulting Group and I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be talking about the recruiting process of BCG only. The process usually starts with the initial CV shortlisting round so there will be around 27 folks getting shortlisted based on their CV and once you are shortlisted then in 10 days, you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll have case rounds with associates and seniors associated with the firm. So there are usually 2\u00e2\u20ac\u201c3 rounds based on how you perform in those rounds and once this is completed you will have a span of 3 days in which you will have final interviews which will be with the principal and partners of the firm. In the principal rounds, the number of interviews will vary from 1 to 3 and again for partner rounds it will vary but most will be 2. The process roughly remains the same across years but the timeline usually varies. Thanks Shashank for explaining the general interview process. Now can you please list down the questions you were asked in the different rounds? Cases, HR Discussions, or puzzles in general that you think will prove to be helpful for students. So in each of the rounds that I have mentioned there will be on an average 6\u00e2\u20ac\u201c7 interviews by combining all the rounds and each of them will have 2 sections, first will be your experience section which is your CV discussion part and then there will a case round, roughly there will span of around 30 minutes for which interviews will last. 2\u00e2\u20ac\u201c3 minutes for the initial round of personal experience then around 20 mins for case solving and 2\u00e2\u20ac\u201c3 minutes for your questions for the interviewer, this will be the general structure for each of the rounds you will go through. So regarding questions, in terms of case studies, the cases generally can be broken into four parts which are guesstimates, profitability, market entry and unconventional. So in the initial rounds, you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll have mixtures of the first three parts i.e guesstimates, profitability and market entry cases, these cases can be in isolation or a mixture and in the final round you will have mostly unconventional cases. So I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll brief in my case, in my first two rounds I had a mixture of guesstimates and market entry and when I advanced to principal rounds, first I had a mixture of guesstimates and profitability and after that, I only had unconventional cases. For instance, in one of the principal rounds, I had a question like suppose there is a steel manufacturing company and I had to suggest recommendations to lower its cost. That would be helpful Coming to the next question What are some of the FAQs in most companies that you faced and think students must prepare for? More specifically, in the context of HR rounds. So in terms of HR questions, BCG doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t, in particular, has any HR round. In all the 6 rounds, they will ask questions based on your personal experience, they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll check your personality so firstly you have to introduce yourself and then they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll pick one of the relevant questions like regarding your recent internship or any other interesting section they find and then they will grill you on that. And once you advance through the partner rounds then the so-called fit \/ Hr questions come in. As in my case, was, I had a similar kind of role in my internship So they asked, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Why management consultancy and why BCG in particular \u00e2\u20ac\u009d, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Where do you see yourself in the next 4\u00e2\u20ac\u201c5 years and what are your future goals and how you see those goals aligned with you spending your time at BCG\u00e2\u20ac\u009d and then there will surely a question when you are interviewing for the consulting firm \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Whether you want to do MBA or not\u00e2\u20ac\u009d. These are some of the questions which they typically ask but with BCG your case solving skills is one that carries more weight. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rightly said, so the next question is What are things students sitting for placements next year can do from now to maximize their chances of getting through a company in consulting? So in any of the consulting firms you sit for, the process starts with CV screening and what they look for is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Spikes in your CV\u00e2\u20ac\u009d, a term you commonly come across when applying for the consult. So you need to have at least a couple of spikes in your CV to get shortlisted and what I mean by spikes is like being in the top 3\u00e2\u20ac\u201c4 candidates who have applied for the firm in that particular genre or in each of the parts that you have in your CV which are Academics, Intern, Position of responsibilities to name a few. So elaborating further, when we talk about academics, having CG above 9 is considered to be a spike, or your department rank 1 or 2. Coming to internships, having a Day 1 internship will be counted as a spike but not only that even if you secured an off-campus internship but at a very reputable firm i.e top in their respective sector then coming to projects if you have FT over there, then surely that will be counted as spike and coming to extracurricular activities if you have Inter-IIT medals that will help or any regional or national awards and when it comes to the position of responsibilities then VP, Placecomms, Gymkhana Gsecs, Senate positions and senior positions in the clubs and cells will be counted as spikes. These are just rough approximations and may vary from firm to firm on how they define it. Moving on to how you need to prepare, first you need to make case groups and the best time for this is in Summers while you will be interning so that you are not left out. Its usually recommended that your case group size is around 3\u00e2\u20ac\u201c4. For case prep, there are no resources available, but to start you can watch \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Case interviews cracked\u00e2\u20ac\u009d workshops by IIT Bombay available on Youtube .so once you have started on then there are 2 case studies books which people usually follow IIT Bombay\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Case interviews Cracked\u00e2\u20ac\u009d which has a good no of questions and then \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Day 1.0\u00e2\u20ac\u009d from IIT Madras. These are the 3 particular sources which I referred to as I had 12\u00e2\u20ac\u201c14 days to prepare so as I had mentioned you should ideally have 3\u00e2\u20ac\u201c4 people in your case group and combining cases from both these books you will have roughly 80 cases, so no of cases that you have is very limited and so you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t need to waste your cases so what I mean from that is, like in your case group there will be different people who\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be making you do cases and then there will be you who will be making them do the cases. So whichever case you are making them do, basically you are reading through the cases so whenever you read through the case the case gets wasted because the core part of it like you solving the case without initially having a run through the cases is crucial as then your raw thinking comes into play as in the hindsight the case would seem very obvious. Now coming to the number of days you need to prepare so 40 days is usually considered ideal but in our case even 15 days sufficed. Now apart from the case-solving skill that you will find in the resources mentioned, your communication and business intuitions are very critical and those are something which you can start working right now, when you read about businesses and you know how different businesses work, how strategic decision making is done, you find yourself in an advantageous position as cases are business scenario simulations. To work on it you can read books on investing or you can refer to Twitter handles and news sources like the Ken. With around 8\u00e2\u20ac\u201c9 months left for a candidate to prepare even if he\/she gives 15\u00e2\u20ac\u201c20 minutes daily then they can accumulate sufficient flavour of business. How did your preparation for Technical rounds evolve once you were shortlisted, please let us know about the resources you used as well? So I mentioned earlier, the timeline you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll have is very short, For BCG in particular we only had 15 days and in general, the CV submission opens by the time you will be wrapping your summer internships, so there will be a lot of chaos and once you receive the shortlist by then only your prep starts. There are 5\u00e2\u20ac\u201c6 skills that are typically looked for which are communication, structuring, mathematics which is problem-solving ability then personality, critical thinking then business acumen. So once you have formed case groups and have started solving cases, you will tend to follow frameworks that you will get used to after solving 4\u00e2\u20ac\u201c5 cases. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s really important you revise each case and learn from the mistakes made and don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t repeat them and try to improvise your framework and make it more and more customized which suits your approach to each of the cases you encounter. Once you have solved sufficient cases in your case group you can start reaching out to seniors who sat for placements in previous years and also try to exchange buddy round cases of other shortlisted candidates. So, anything else that you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d want to share with the students? So something that I have felt in my stay at KGP. Since we have a crowd of around 1500 folks sitting for placements, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chaotic as times and people tend to run behind the things just for the sake of glory a particular profile brings with it. So you must take a break and understand where you fit in, try talking to seniors who will help you in the process. Now coming to specifically what you need to work upon is something I have already talked about just to add on that the case groups that you will be forming need to be people who are honest and brutal to you and share the same enthusiasm as you are the average of your case group. Also when you will be shortlisted what happens is that various companies will be releasing their shortlists in a short time so what usually tends to happen is people receive the shortlist in one and not in others so they tend to lose confidence and drop preparation midway so you need to have the right kind of people in your case group who don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t drop the preparation midway. Apart from that since consulting has very limited offers so at times people usually tend to think that it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not worth investing 1\u00e2\u20ac\u201c1.5 months for case interviews preparations but what happens is the very skills you develop from your case preparation helps you ace other interviews be it product, finance or Business analyst. So if you believe you have a knack for it you should surely give it a shot without being concerned about your chances of making it. Thank you Shashank, for giving your precious time for this interview to Communiqu\u00c3\u00a9 IIT Kharagpur. I hope your interview will help the students in their endeavours and we wish you all the best for your future achievements. Thank you!

So Aarushi, I will be asking you a couple of questions regarding the strategies to crack the interviews of consulting companies. What was the general interview process for the companies you interviewed? Also, please mention the number of rounds and the nature of the interview process. Well, I interviewed only for Dalberg. We started with a primary shortlist round; there were around 40 people. And after that, we had a test. About 12\u00e2\u20ac\u201c13 people appeared for the test. Then we had a buddy session; there was a buddy assigned to all of us from Dalberg itself. So this buddy round went up to two weeks. My buddy did two cases with me, and she guided me on things to do. I am not exactly sure if this round is evaluated, but they help a lot. After this, we had interviews. I had four interviews conducted over two days. The first two were the senior consultant rounds, and the next two were partner rounds. The actual interview was an hour-long- 20 minutes for HR and 40 minutes for the case. Okay. Moving ahead, Could you please list down the questions you were asked in the different rounds? Like the Cases, HR Discussions, or puzzles in general that you think will prove to be helpful for students. Right. So all the HR questions were general. The first question is always to introduce yourself. The next they ask is why consulting. Also, why social consulting in my case and why Dalberg in particular. So these are the questions I feel are common in every interview. All they want to know is about your interest and your preparation. Apart from that, they asked about my previous internships or PORs, anything they felt was interesting in my CV. So preparing your CV well is important. In the end, their questions were a bit different like what my plans were for the next five years in the future or particular instances by giving examples a little more in detail. As for the cases, all four of them were based on development sectors on actual projects my interviewers worked on. So they didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have a separate questionnaire; each one of them asked something from their previous experiences. If I have to talk about the actual questions asked, the first question I was asked was the development of the economy in a small country that recently became an independent nation from South East Asia called East Timor. So the discussion went towards a direction where I had to talk about the agricultural economy and how we can boost it. The second case was about opening bank accounts for women in India and what we could do towards it, finding out particular sections of the Indian society where women aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t opening bank accounts and are left behind. So basically, we had to come up with ways we could combat this problem. The third round was a partner round about solar lamps in India. So, they wanted to see if we could replace kerosene oil altogether with solar lamps. It was more of a guesstimate where I had to calculate the total amount of kerosene used in India and then see how solar lamps could replace it. Then my last case was also a partner round. It was about introducing educational technologies in Andhra Pradesh. They wanted to introduce a new system that would teach better in govt schools. They wanted to look into how to do it, the cost, and ways to lower the cost. These interviews did not follow a general framework, but all of them had a few quantitative elements where I had to calculate something. So my next question is what are some of the FAQs in most companies that you faced and think students must prepare for? More specifically, in the context of HR rounds. The most frequently asked questions tell about yourself, why consulting and why that company. So these questions are to be prepared beforehand. Other questions were based on CV, and it depends on how the interview moves ahead, but these questions are asked in every interview, be it any company. Okay, Aarushi, What do you think are things students sitting for placements next year can do from now on to maximize their chances of getting through a company in consulting? So solving cases would help. I noticed in my Dalberg interviews that they were very off the books and did not follow a specific framework. So if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re already familiar with the process, it becomes easy to answer every problem given to you. So practising is going to be helpful. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s better to make a group and start practising as early as possible. Practising with others and getting ideas from someone who knows better is very important. Okay. Moving on. Please tell us how your preparation for case rounds evolved once you were shortlisted? Also, please let us know about the resources you used as well. I practised with my batchmates and people around me for case rounds. Also, practising with seniors is something you should focus on to know where you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re going wrong. We used IIT Madras and IIT Bombay case books. I did cases from these books, and once I got my buddies, the format changed. I then started with cases quite different from those given in books, the development-based one. My buddy helped me understand how to approach different problems. Also, a book called \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Case Interviews Secrets\u00e2\u20ac\u009d by Victor Cheng gives a broad idea of what you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re supposed to do in the field. So, now we have almost come to the end of the interview. Anything else that you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d want to share with the students? I think preparing for HR beforehand is essential because you have to come up with something that impresses interviewers. Try interacting with the interviewers because the cases are not necessarily straightforward. So interacting is very important since they can change the flow of the entire discussion, and you have to pick up on what they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re saying and react accordingly. These are a few things that books generally don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t teach us. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s all from our side, Aarushi. Thank you for being with us. Thank you!

This is Yash from Communiqu\u00c3\u00a9. Congratulations on being placed at HUL. I want to take a short interview with you if you give your consent; ready? Hello Yash, Sure, go ahead. What was the general interview process for the companies you interviewed for? Please mention the number of rounds and the nature of the interview process. So, for HUL, the first round was the Resume submission through ERP. Along with the resume submission, HUL want their candidates to fill a Questionnaire consisting of 10-12 questions._x000D_\nThey shortlisted 10 people for the next round. These 10 people have to give a recorded interview which was organised on a platform called \u00e2\u20ac\u0153HireVue\u00e2\u20ac\u009d. So, on this platform, the candidate has to read the question. After reading the question, the candidate could think for 1-1.5 minutes for the answer and then has to record his\/her answer which could be of 3-5 minutes. There were 3 questions in this round with a break of 2 mins between the questions (optional). The candidate has only one chance to record his\/her answer._x000D_\nThe final round was Personal Interview round and 4 people were shortlisted for this round. The questions asked in this round were mostly technical questions based on the core knowledge (mostly on practical applications) and questions on the CV submitted. The complete interview spanned around 40 minutes._x000D_\nI\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d like to add details for P&G and ITC as well, because anyone who plans to apply for this field, generally applies to all the three firms. So, for P&G, the candidate has to take their standardized game\/test in the first round. After this round, 24 candidates are selected for the next round, which was the Group Interview round. The interview spanned around 1 hour. Out of the 24 candidates that were selected for group interview round, they shortlisted only 1 candidate for the next round which was Personal Interview._x000D_\nFor ITC, they initially mentioned that they would recruit people only through \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcInterrobang\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, ITC's unique campus engagement initiative. But later, they also opened through ERP. The first round was CV shortlisting and the second round was Group Discussion round. After the second round, few people were shortlisted for the Personal Interview which was the final round. Could you please list down the questions that were you asked in the different rounds? Puzzles, technical problems, any other discussion in general that you think will prove helpful for students. The questions in the first round of the HUL, which was form filling, were related to previous experience of any internship or project; and some questions were on the behavioural side, as well as some HR questions. So, the candidate has to prepare a very good answer to fill in the form. In the second round, all the three questions were completely based on the Supply Chain Management. Good Communication skills were required here to articulate a proper answer in the given time duration. For the Personal interview round, they mainly focused on the core subjects. The questions were related to the practical applications of the theorems and concepts taught in core subjects._x000D_\nFor P&G, the first round consists of two tests: one is behavioural type and the other one assesses cognitive ability. In the first test, one is provided with a situation and they are asked to choose the option that they relate with the most. Cognitive assessment contains memory game, numerical ability game, etc. to assess cognitive ability of the candidate. So, the candidate has to answer as many questions as he\/she can in the given amount of time (which was about 1 min). In the Group Interview round, three people were put in the same panel and same questions were asked to all the candidates, which were mostly related to giving instances of something related to previous experiences and they wanted the answer in the C-A-R format (Context-Action-Result)._x000D_\nIn ITC, they selected some students from the competition \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcInterrobang\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. The case study of this event had a real-life problem, which had to be worked upon. Selection process through ERP had a GD round, as already said. The topic of discussion was related to suggesting the best possible option for the given scenario. What are some of the FAQs you face and think students must prepare for in most companies? More specifically, in the context of HR rounds. Firstly, work on the communication skills. Having good communication skills will give you an edge over others. The way you explain and articulate your points is very important. Also, for the introduction and other initial questions, try to be confident because that will create your first impression on the Interviewer. You can practice your introduction in front of mirror to make it perfect, but make sure that you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t sound robotic. Also, prepare for question like \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcWhy do you want join this firm?\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcWhy should we hire you? \u00e2\u20ac\u02dc and other similar questions beforehand. What are things students sitting for placements next year can do from now until December to maximise their chances of getting through a company in this sector? Firstly, Work upon your CV and try to have a decent CGPA. Try to add some spikes (PORs, good internships, competitions, awards etc.) in your CV, which you can talk about in your interview. Communication skills matter a lot. So, try to enhance your communication skills. There are questions asked from the core domain as well, so start preparing for the core subjects also. Get a basic idea about supply chain management too._x000D_\nTry to contact seniors who are placed in these firms and take guidance from them. You can prepare answers for the most frequently asked Questions in the HUL (or any FMCG company) interview to avoid any fumble during the interview. How did your preparation for technical rounds evolve once you were shortlisted? There was only one round that I felt was a bit more technical and that was personal interview. They asked many questions from Core subjects and dug really deep on that. They want how candidate can apply his\/her theoretical knowledge on practical stuffs. So, try to understand the practical applications of the theorems and concepts you are learning in your core subjects. You can also ask the seniors of your department about the type of technical questions asked in the interview, as the questions may vary. Anything else that you would want to share with the students? Firstly, give sufficient focus on making your CV, because that is your first impression. Get it reviewed by multiple people, and don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t add stuffs which you cannot defend. Then, connect with your seniors who are placed these firms and know about the firm and work culture. Further, clear your doubts about the selection process and get to know about frequently asked questions in the interview. Give equal importance to each and every step._x000D_\nFor PI, prepare a short introduction of yourself and practice it thoroughly. Further, prepare a 1-2min gist of every internships, projects, PORs, etc which you might have mentioned in your CV, which you can speak of when asked about that project, intern, etc. Keep it short so that the interviewer doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t lose interest and has some room to ask follow up question. It will help to create a friendly conversation. Also, if you are stating any POR or competition organised in IIT Kharagpur (like GC), start the conversation by giving a little information about it because the interviewer may not be familiar with the event and would be expecting to get to know about the event first. So, tell the interviewer about the event and make them understand how it was important. Be confident during the interview and try to have a good conversation rather than a single person monologue._x000D_\nFurther, prepare the commonly asked questions related to each CV point which are difficult to think of in the first try and are tricky ones. Express your points in simpler terms (using minimum jargons). Do as many as mock interview as you can and take feedback of the interview and work upon the mistakes. These mock PIs will give you an idea on more cross questions (hence, explaining the importance of mocks). Further, reiterating, improve your communication skills. Try to speak your introduction in front of mirror to boost your confidence and avoid any fumble._x000D_\nLast, but on the least, believe in yourself, because if you won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t, then who else will._x000D_\nAll the best!

Could you also mention the number of rounds and the nature of the interview process? Hello Aparna! I interviewed at BCG, after which I got my offer. There was a CV shortlisting process that involved selecting a group of roughly 25 to 30 candidates based on their academic performance, extracurricular involvement, and academic achievements. Therefore, there were two rounds: the first round involved the project leader, and the second round involved the managing director and senior partners. In addition, I was shortlisted for Bain & Company, LEK, and P&G. There is a buddy round for each of these consulting firms. That was insightful. Coming to the second question, Could you please list the questions that were asked in the different rounds? Cases, HR Discussions, or puzzles in general that you think will be helpful for students. In my first round, which I had with the project leader, he gave me an example of a problem that he had handled. We needed to identify the underlying reasons why our client wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t as profitable as the competitors. He said, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153You can compare the company to an Indian IT Multinational like Infosys or Wipro\u00e2\u20ac\u009d. For this, I looked at the decisions made and eventually came to the conclusion that there were a variety of costs involved, and the problem was a cost-related one. For instance, the business had server maintenance expenditures that were an issue for our firm but one that the competitors did not have. This was all about the first round, and then in the second round, a Managing Director & Senior Partner at BCG took the round. I was given a question concerning a supermarket chain that was experiencing lower profits than its competitors in the same region. We had to diagnose the reason why the business was not performing and generating revenue. This case was a bit complex, for it was a cost as well as a revenue issue, and I had to perform a root-cause analysis and propose potential solutions. What are some of the FAQs in most companies that you faced and think students must prepare for? More specifically, in the context of HR rounds. In an HR interview, there are often two different thought processes that can occur; one is that your CV is pointing toward one particular direction, and my case was the other one, which is towards multiple domains and internship areas. The interviewer eventually questioned me, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153You are oriented towards entrepreneurship, so would you continue to be a consultant, or would you quit our firm and become an entrepreneur or startup founder? \u00e2\u20ac\u0153. It was a natural question because my CV was focused on startups and entrepreneurship. I tackled this through an emphasis on gaining industry exposure before making a real venture to change the way an industry behaves. On the other hand, it can also be very peculiar when people read very specific points that we have written in our CV. For example, someone wrote he likes to read Harry Potter, so they inquired as to why he read it, what he learned from it, and what three lessons he took away from it. All right, so moving ahead, this is for the students who will be sitting for the placements next year. So what are the things they can do from now until December to maximise their chances of getting through a company in consulting? Okay, so they will first go through a CV shortlisting process, where 20 to 30 people will be chosen for these positions at McKinsey & Company, BCG, LEK, Bain & Company and other consulting firms. What we need to do is to take care of all the sectors. Therefore, an excellent consulting CV is relatively balanced and includes a few interns (2\u00e2\u20ac\u201c3), and having at least one well-known company demonstrates your credibility as an employee of the company. Post your academic achievements like department ranks, scholarships and prizes won. After that, scholastic achievements can be mentioned, like if you are an NTSE scholar, or if you have any additional fellowship or anything that distinguishes you from the crowd, they also focus on your CG. This time, I noticed that all of the shortlists were above 8\u00e2\u20ac\u201c8.5 CG, which is something that everyone should keep in mind. I believe that PORs have a specific role to play in the consulting sector, such as being a member of or leading a club, as it shows your time management and leadership skills. How did your preparation for technical rounds evolve once you were shortlisted? Once the CV shortlisting was completed, we had a very limited amount of time. The interviewers took only 2\u00e2\u20ac\u201c3 rounds when hiring interns, but more rounds (5\u00e2\u20ac\u201c6) can be expected when hiring full-time employees. I think that practising case interviews using resources like the Victor Cheng videos on YouTube and DayOne: IIT Madras Consulting book will be helpful, which can be topped up with Case Interviews Cracked to ensure practice. Okay, so would you like to share any last-minute tips that are very important, and it helps a lot? I think it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s crucial whom you practise your cases with, that is your case buddy, because handling a case is not something you can do alone. Additionally, getting advice from seniors is vital since, say, you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re discussing a case with a friend, and both of you have a general grasp of how it works. If you practise together, you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll acquire a collaborative understanding. You\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be able to tell what the other guy is trying to communicate, for example. But performing cases with a neutral partner or a senior really helps you out, as it becomes a levelling ground for making mistakes and learning from them. For example, my most significant cases were with alumni and seniors from IIT KGP\/K\/D, who gave me advice on how to act in diverse situations, which was a chunk of knowledge that did not reside at the batch level. Therefore, I would like to emphasise that choosing the appropriate case buddy and advisor is crucial Thanks a lot for your suggestions. With this, the interview comes to an end. All right, Aryansh, it was great talking to you and knowing your experiences and insights.

Hello Sruthi, Good Afternoon, how are you doing today? Hello Arka! I am fine, and you? I am fine as well. Firstly, heartiest congratulations to you for winning the Bain True North Scholarship, by one of the topmost management consulting firms in the world.What was the general interview process for the Scholarship ? Could you also mention the number of rounds and the nature of the interview process? I got into Bain via the True North Scholarship program, which was open for women in their 2nd year of a 4yr course or 3rd year of their dual degree course. The process started around the end of March. It was a threefold process where the first part was to apply for the scholarship by submitting your CV and an essay on the given topic, which in our case was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153True North\u00e2\u20ac\u009d. The second step was to take a test which consisted of an aptitude test and a personality test. These two steps were standard for all applicants. Post this, there was a shortlist for the personal interview rounds. The interviews consist of two rounds. The first round is the guesstimate\/case round, and the second round is the HR round. These interview rounds were similar to any consulting recruitment interviews. The winners were announced a couple of weeks after the interviews. Thanks for briefing about the process. Could you please share tips for each of them or guidance for the same? Alright. So, for the CV, I would suggest them to have a very well-made CV, following the general guidelines laid out for a consulting resume. The need to ensure that they have decent academics, good internships and active extracurricular involvements._x000D_\n_x000D_\nFor the essay, the topic for us was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153 What does True North mean to you?\u00e2\u20ac\u009d. The essay can be about your journey so far, an incident that has inspired you or a series of defining moments in your life. It is completely up to you but it is important for you to come up with a very well written essay with a story that is engaging and impressive while conveying as much as you can within the given word limit. Usage of good language and being to the point is very important._x000D_\n_x000D_\nFor the test, I would suggest that you go through the sample test link provided to gauge the type of questions. It might not need a lot of preparation since they are basic mental ability based questions. For the personality questionnaire, it is important to be consistent throughout. That was insightful. Coming to the next question, Could you please list the questions you were asked in the different rounds? Cases, HR Discussions, or puzzles in general that you think will prove to be helpful for students. I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think any specific question was repeatedly asked in the interview rounds. In the first round, we were asked guesstimates like \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcestimate the market size of sim cards in India\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcestimate the number of street dogs in India\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 etc. The questions varied from person to person based on their interests and other things. In the second round, they try to understand more about your career aspirations, experiences, strengths, and weaknesses. So moving ahead, since you only applied for Bain, what are the most frequently asked questions you think the students should prepare for? Since this was the first time this scholarship was launched in India, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m unsure about the FAQs. But generally, it was very similar to the general process followed by MBBs. Preparing accordingly would be helpful. In case someone wants to prepare from early on, they can focus on improving their communication skills, think in a structured manner and develop business acumen. Otherwise, preparing after the shortlist would be sufficient, which is what I did. Alright, so moving ahead, this is for the students who will be applying for the scholarship next year. So what are the things they can do from now until next March to maximize their chances of getting through this? Again, this is very similar to the process of recruitment for consulting companies, especially MBBs. People applying for this should have a good resume which entails having good internships, PoRs, a good CG etc. Other than that, honing your communication skills, working on things you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re passionate about or doing anything that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d help you develop a well-rounded personality is recommended. Thanks for the answer. So, moving on to the next question, how did your preparation for interview rounds evolve once you were shortlisted? Since the scholarship was launched in India in 2022 for the first time, which was when I applied, I hadn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t started my preparation before the shortlist. They had explicitly mentioned what the round would entail in the email we received regarding the shortlist. Once I got the email, I started practicing guesstimates and cases with friends. The resources that I had used were the Vault Guide to Case interview and the Guessing Game: A handbook to guesstimates. More resources are available online for the same After getting a little comfortable, I also did a few guesstimates with my seniors. Sample guesstimates can be searched for online. I started preparing for the HR round after getting through the first round. Seniors played a massive role during my preparation, so I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d recommend you to approach them for help. Okay, so would you like to share any last-minute tips that are very important, and it helps a lot. The only thing that matters during the process is not to get stressed. While it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s easy to get overwhelmed and lose track, staying calm and focused is essential. As long as you can communicate clearly and follow a structured approach, you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d be good to go. Keeping in touch with your friends throughout the process would help you a lot, since they will be the moral support you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d need. Thanks a lot for your suggestions. With this, the interview comes to an end. Alright Sruthi, it was great talking to you and knowing your experiences and insights. Thank You. It was a pleasure being interviewed.

Hello Apoorv, Good Afternoon, how are you doing today? Hello Arka! I am doing well, and how about you? I am fine as well. Firstly,heartiest congratulations to you for bagging an internship at Bain and Co., one of the topmost management consulting firms in the world. So here goes the first question. What was the general interview process for the companies you interviewed? Could you also mention the number of rounds and the nature of the interview process? Okay, so there were 3 rounds after CV Shortlisting. 1st round was a case round that lasted for around 40 minutes followed by another case round (2nd round) of 20\u00e2\u20ac\u201c25 minutes followed by the final HR round (10 mins)_x000D_\n_x000D_\nNature of the interviews:_x000D_\n_x000D_\n1st round was majorly interviewer driven, where the interviewer was giving me data points, and relevant information to drive the case. Whereas the 2nd round was a lot different, here I had to create several hypotheses around the problem statement, finally narrowing it down to the solutions._x000D_\n_x000D_\nPS: Post shortlisting, we were allotted mentors (Bain employees) with whom we had our mock interview rounds, but those were non-evaluative. Those mock interviews helped me a lot to get acquainted with the case-solving process. That was insightful. Coming to the second question, Could you please list the questions that were asked in the different rounds? Cases, HR Discussions, or puzzles in general that you think will prove to be helpful for students. : There were 2 types of questions, purely case-based and then CV based. Here are the round-wise detailed questions:_x000D_\n_x000D_\nRound 1_x000D_\n_x000D_\nCase: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Suppose the CEO of an e-commerce company approached you, and they are running a loyalty program for a year, and you need to calculate the cost incurred in implementing the loyalty program.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d_x000D_\n_x000D_\nNow, as I dived into the case, there were different questions. E.g. In the end, when I calculated the cost invested in the program, the interviewer asked me, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153How would you report this to the CEO, and what will be your recommendations to reduce this cost\u00e2\u20ac\u009d._x000D_\n_x000D_\nRound 2_x000D_\n_x000D_\nCV: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Any experience you would like to share and what were your key takeaways from that experience.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d_x000D_\n_x000D_\nCase: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Suppose you are the CEO of a toothbrush manufacturing company and your R&D head approaches you. He has developed a special toothbrush that lasts forever, and it has been made using a special plastic, and chemical. Basically, it is a future toothbrush, you can use it as long as you can. Now you have to build a hypothesis and talk about the pros and cons of this product.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d_x000D_\n_x000D_\nAfter that, he moved into Pricing where he asked \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If we have to launch the product in the market, then how should we price it?\u00e2\u20ac\u009d_x000D_\n_x000D_\nRound 3_x000D_\n_x000D_\nAnd then the 3rd one which I feel is one of the most important ones for consulting companies. Here, I was asked:_x000D_\n_x000D_\na) Why Consulting, and Why particularly Bain?_x000D_\n_x000D_\nb) Where do you see yourself in the next 3\u00e2\u20ac\u201c5 years?_x000D_\n_x000D_\nc) My CV was more inclined towards Product Management, as I had done a few internships in the same. So the interviewer asked me again \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Why do you want to go for consulting, why not Product Management\u00e2\u20ac\u009d Thanks for the answer. So, moving on to the next question, how did your preparation for case rounds evolve once you were shortlisted? For case prep, guesstimates and to have a basic idea of how to approach a problem statement, I started with Victor Cheng videos followed by 4 videos of CIC, and IIT Bombay (Link to the videos)._x000D_\n_x000D_\nPS: But I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll suggest doing this in reverse order._x000D_\n_x000D_\nThen I started practicing mock rounds with my friends in an interviewer-interviewee format, where I followed these resources (Link):_x000D_\n_x000D_\n1) CIC, IIT Bombay Case Book_x000D_\n_x000D_\n2) Guesstimate book by Communiqu\u00c3\u00a9, IIT Kharagpur_x000D_\n_x000D_\n3) Bury the Hatchet with case problems_x000D_\n_x000D_\n4) Day 1 (IITM Casebook)_x000D_\n_x000D_\nInterviewer: Alright, so moving ahead, this is for the students who will be sitting for the placements next year. So what are the things they can do from now until December to maximize their chances of getting through a company in consulting?_x000D_\n_x000D_\nApoorv: Firstly, I would like to say that in consult, to have your CV shortlisted is like a black box. The very first thing students should work on is building a stellar CV._x000D_\n_x000D_\nA few parameters I feel a consulting company looks for while CV shortlisting:_x000D_\n_x000D_\n1) Good CG (>8.5)_x000D_\n_x000D_\n2) Position of responsibilities_x000D_\n_x000D_\n3) Internships (Prefers brands to startups\/ Foreign Training also adds a great value)_x000D_\n_x000D_\n4) Extra Curricular (E.g.

I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll share a drive link with you, please attach those resources in the article itself. Okay, so would you like to share any last-minute tips that are very important, and it helps a lot? I think the previous responses were pretty exhaustive. But still, if asked, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll have one thing to add, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Excel at what you do\u00e2\u20ac\u009d and you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re good to go. Thanks a lot for your suggestions. With this, the interview comes to an end. Alright, Apoorv, it was great talking to you and knowing your experiences and insights. Thank You, Arka. It was a pleasure being interviewed.

And today we have Mr. Rahul Saini who has bagged an internship at BNY Mellon as an software Developer Engineer. Hello Rahul, first of all congratulations for the internship, how are you doing today? Rahul:  Hello Anupam! Thank you very much. I am fine, and you? What was the general interview process for the companies you interviewed? Please mention the number of rounds and the nature of the interview process. So I had 2 rounds of interviews : _x000D_\n1. Technical Interview - The interview started with a general introduction and then he asked me a coding question which I had to code live in front of him which was followed by some intermediate questioning at every level then he asked me some questions regarding my CV projects. _x000D_\n2. HR - This interview also started with a general introduction. Then he asked me about my CV projects. After that, he asked me about my general interest fields and it was an open discussion. _x000D_\nHe asked me some questions related to finance too. Could you please list down questions you were asked in the different rounds? Puzzles, technical questions, or any other discussion in general that you think will prove to be helpful for students. One DSA coding question regarding selecting two numbers from an array which have a constant sum. It was a fundamental question with a little twist in the time complexity and edge cases. What are some of the FAQs in most companies that you faced and think students must definitely prepare for? More specifically, in the context of HR rounds. For FAQs, it is advisable to solve the Leetcode and InterviewBit problems. Some of the questions might get repeated. What are things students sitting for placements next year can do from now until December to maximise their chances of getting through a company in this sector? For software profiles, they should definitely start Competitive Programming because that's an important skill to crack the coding rounds. _x000D_\nIn addition to this, they should start building their CV by adding some good projects because interviewers often ask about those CV projects. How did your preparation for technical rounds evolve once you were shortlisted? I tried solving InterviewBit problems and some Leetcode problems. This really helped me in my technical rounds because some questions were kind of similar to those I practiced from these platforms. Thanks a lot for your suggestions. With this, the interview comes to an end. Alright Rahul, it was great talking to you and knowing your experiences and insights. Thank You. It was a pleasure being interviewed.

How are you doing today? Pranav: Yeah I am fine Okay so firstly the heartiest congratulations to you for getting an internship. So basically in this short interview I will ask you a few questions for our blog series. The blog will be shared with the KGP community to guide them through the selection process by your experience. So if you are ready can we start? Yeah yeah sure Thank you very much. Let's begin. So here goes our first question. What was the general interview process for the companies you have interviewed? Kindly mention the number of rounds and the nature of the interview process Pranav:  Alright so, I was shortlisted for around 6-7 companies. I interviewed for three companies and I got my offer after interviewing with the third company. So the three companies were NK Securities Research, QuantBox and Nutanix. They were in this particular order itself. So for NK Securities there were basically two rounds. The first round was more or less some basic puzzles and software\/CP related questions. The second round was more like medium to hard level puzzles. And the interviewers were very friendly and they gave suggestions if you got stuck. I got my offer from NK Securities at the EOD. And then, for QuantBox there was only one round. After the first round I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t make it to the second round. And then for Nutanix there were again two rounds. And the first round was around 1.5 hours long. And it contained normal SDE questions and basic coding questions and some debugging problems as well. Basically they gave me one or two codes and asked me to debug the problem in the code and suggest changes. And then the second round for Nutanix was a HR round. And in the HR round the interviewer asked me questions related to my CV and what I had done till now, like my society and different stuff and basic HR questions. I received an offer from Nutanix in the HR round itself and didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t sit for other interviews. Yeah, that's more or less the nature of the interview process. Interviewer: Okay, that's nice to know. Would you like to list any other discussion in general that you think will prove important for the students? Pranav: I would say the interview process might get a little bit hectic because the interviews are like back to back. So you just need to calm down and don't get stressed out because all the interviewers are pretty similar in each of the companies, you just need to be calm and also the interviewers are friendly as well. So just don't stress out. Just go through the whole process. And at the end of the day, you will be very happy if you get selected. And even if you did not get selected, there are always other chances and It's not a report card for you. Like, if you can't get an internship through CDC, then that in no way should dishearten you. It is just a process and there are many other opportunities as well. Try to explore different fields like research or entrepreneurship. If you are not comfortable with this process, then try to do what you want to do. Don't just go with the crowd. Interviewer: Okay, that's amazing. Moving on to the next part. What are the things students sitting for placements next year can do from now until December to_x000D_\nmaximize their chances of getting to a company in this sector? Pranav: So for placement, the process is similar, but I would say try to hone your coding skills as much as possible. Let me tell you only about software because I know about that. So try to strengthen your coding skills as much as possible. Try to give different contests of different sites like Codeforces or Codechef, etc. And always try to up-solve, Like many people do give contests, but don't up-solve. What up-solving is, let's say you are solving questions and say you are able to solve questions of certain difficulty, for ex. 1200 or 1500. Then always try to increase your bar. If you can solve questions of 1500 level, don't just keep solving them. Try to solve questions of 1800 level, 1900 level and try to up-solve. And if you get stuck in a question, don't just look up the answer. First, try to give your 100%. And then if you cannot think about the answer, then the solution is always there for you. But first try to give your 100% thought about it. Interviewer: Okay, that's amazing. Moving on to the next part. How did your preparation evolve for technical and case study rounds once you were selected? Pranav: Okay, so for me, there were no case study rounds. There were only technical rounds. So once I got shortlisted, I got to know about the shortlist from Nutanix like one or two days ago. But for NK Securities and Quantbox, it was just the day before my interviews, So there was not a very particular company based preparation. But basically what I did on the last day, when I got to know about my shortlist, I just researched a little about the companies. Because if you're going to give an interview for a company, you should know about the company and what they do. Because they expect you to know that, at least for the placement process. So just research about the company, I searched about what is the profile that they are looking for, and what is the industry that they work in, what are the different types of other companies of that particular industry. Just a little bit of research, not much. So that is what I did just before my day of interview Interviewer: Okay. So that's the next question for you. What will be your advice for first years on how they can start preparing themselves for this particular domain? Pranav: Okay. So for software or for HFT, I would say, for the first years, you don't need to do anything for HFT in particular. But for software, you can start preparing from a course from the CSE department, which is Algorithms. CSEstudents, they have it in their curriculum, but non-CSE students, they can do this course, it is freely available online, the websites are open to all. So they can go to the course webpage and try to watch the lectures and read the slides. Also, I think the laboratory part is pretty good because the questions are of a good and a little difficult level for beginners. And you need to solve them in three hours. They will give you a good grasp of each and every topic individually. And when they are done with that, they can start solving a little bit of questions from different coding websites. I won't suggest starting contests right away because nowadays contests are a little bit of an ad-hoc type. So they are like a combination of five or six topics. So that would not be very great for the learning process. So try to solve previous questions, like questions from old contests, and topic-wise questions. Yeah, that would be pretty much more than enough for the first years. Interviewer:Okay. So moving towards the last question. Anything else in general that you would want to share with the students? Okay, Apart from all this coding stuff, there is one thing that people generally overlook is HR rounds. For me, there was only one HR round in Nutanix. But in general, there are almost all software companies have HR rounds. So don't undermine it, prepare for it as well. You should be well-prepared through your CV. Many people don't give that much attention to CV. In software although, what does your CV contains doesn't matter. But whatever it is, you should be well-prepared with that much at least. So prepare your CV well. And also, in the HR rounds, they are very friendly, but they will ask questions just to check whether you can communicate, whether you can collaborate with your team or not. So try to be as open and as free as possible because they will ask some of the questions like what will you do in this situation? What will you do in that situation? So try to answer them as well. And also prepare for some of the basic questions like questions about your CV and why should we hire you etc. So try to prepare for the basic part and for the other things that they ask, try to be as free and as open as possible Interviewer: Thanks a lot for your Answers. With this, the interview comes to an end. It was great talking to you and knowing your experiences and insights. Pranav: Yeah, thank you.

This is Somyajeet from Communiqu\u00c3\u00a9. Congratulations on being placed at Sprinklr. I will be asking you a few questions about the selection process, so shall we start? Hi. First of all, I would like to briefly introduce myself, as it will be better for all of the viewers to get clarity of who I am. My name is Aniket Kumar Jha and I'm a final year undergraduate student of the department of Mining Engineering, enrolled in its B.Tech course at IIT Kharagpur. I am a boarder of Lala Lajpat Rai Hall of Residence and I am a native of Bokaro, Jharkhand. I recently got a full-time placement offer from Sprinklr for the role of Associate Product Manager. Wonderful. So let's start with the questions, Aniket. First of all, what was the general interview process for the companies you interviewed, please mention the number of rounds and the nature of the interview process. I got shortlisted by multiple companies, I will brief you about my interview process at Sprinklr and others will have their rounds similar to these. The general interview process at Sprinklr consists of four rounds, and before that, there was an aptitude test followed by resume-based filtering. Sprinklr also conducted a case study competition for the APM role on the topic of CCaas, Customer Care as a Service and the national winners for the same would be given cash rewards and pre-placement interview offers. I became the campus winner but was not fortunate enough to be the nationwide winner._x000D_\n_x000D_\nSo, my process actually began through the aptitude test consisting of logical reasoning, and quantitative and data visualization questions. The questions are having a time constraint, so a 2-month practice before appearing would be good. After this test followed by a resume-based shortlist, I got a call for an interview. Now, coming to the interview, there were 4 rounds in total._x000D_\nThe first three of them were product rounds, and the final one was a cultural\/HR round. The first three rounds were taken by people with increasing seniority and consisted of product case studies, product-related questions, and guesstimates in general. Okay, that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s awesome. So moving on, could you please list down some questions that you were asked in the different rounds, like puzzles and other discussions in general that you think will be helpful for the students? Sure, the first shortlisting round was an aptitude test and this round was the same for both the PA and APM roles. Going specifically to the interview rounds, the first round was an extensive interview and started with my introduction. I was then asked about improvements to the existing Twitter product, how I can optimize the Google Drive storage, how will I make WhatsApp a super-app where people can do all end-to-end digital actions without switching to another app, improvements to the Google Sheets android application, and finally a guestimate to evaluate the number of WhatsApp messages sent in my city._x000D_\n_x000D_\nThe second round was similar to the first round and I was grilled about my favorite app. I was then asked about a product design problem, to design a feature for children for cash withdrawal and deposit. It finally ended with a guestimate to evaluate the total number of traffic lights in any metropolitan city of my choice._x000D_\n_x000D_\nIn the third round, I was asked to give a non-resume-specific introduction. I was then asked to think about three product portfolios that Zomato can adopt in a year to increase its annual revenue by 70%. It ended with a question about why only Product when I have better experience in other domains too._x000D_\n_x000D_\nThe final round was a Cultural cum HR round where I was asked resume-specific behavioral questions, mostly PORs and campus involvements, and a bit of psychometric and client-manager-stakeholders situation problems. That gives us a great idea of everything, I guess. So moving on, what are some of the frequently asked questions in most companies that you face and think students must definitely prepare for? More specifically in the context of HR rounds? In general, what happens is that most of us, like the candidates appearing for placements or even internships, usually skip the interview preparation, especially the HR round, and keep it as a last-month resort. Usually, the last month will be the most hectic, as one will have a lot of elements to look at, and keeping something as important as preparing an interview round, is a total blunder. The second thing is that most candidates believe that they are better at aptitude solving, which in most cases they are, but they may lack the speed required to get shortlisted for further rounds. Both of these rounds are very common, hold a lot of significance in the selection process, and are in general highly underrated among the masses._x000D_\n_x000D_\nSo apart from your specific domain or core preparation, one should start investing a part of their daily time in preparation for these two rounds. As for aptitude problems, practicing the relevant sections of the previous year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CAT papers would be more than enough, and even if you start by the end of July, you will have a good hand over it. Also, start practicing guesstimates, quant, prob & stats, and puzzles. Preparation resources for the same are abundant, so don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t spend a lot of time choosing them. Also, don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t jump to and fro from one resource to another, approaching seniors or even your peers would be the best way to select one._x000D_\n_x000D_\nBefore the preparation of the HR round, spend enough time on making your resume and then get it reviewed by seniors or maybe anyone in your network who has the same domain expertise which you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re targeting. As soon you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re done with the resume part, start preparing it. You should prepare every line of your resume. You should have at least three minutes of speech ready for each line. You can shorten that speech if needed, but you should have that much content to say if they grill you on that particular line. You should know about every number and every detail, from where it is coming, to how it will be relevant for the respective role for which you are applying. I love 5STAR. This is a technique to show the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s HR, how our past experiences and PORs are relevant and fit their role requirements. It is similar to the star approach to describe an experience which is first with the situation or objective, then the task given, the action taken, and the final result, plus you give yourself a score on a scale of five, on the interviewer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s feedback or on how they reacted, so that you can improve the same with time._x000D_\n_x000D_\nOne should structure their answers in a way that highlights their skills and achievements specific to the role. For example, if someone asked me why I am suitable for a product role, I would say that I have worked in roles that involved products before, and I am finding myself more inclined to it. Even if I only have prior software development internship experience, I would show that I have an understanding of how product development works, how the product life cycle goes on, what is the culture of start-ups and corporate, and why I enjoy working in that. I would demonstrate my openness to learn how a product role goes on. I would also show that I know the major jargons that I would encounter in my daily work life and that I can easily ace the specific role requirements._x000D_\n_x000D_\nThe HR round is just a mere check of whether you will fit in the company in the respective role or not. So go through the company pages, the values, and the vision that the company or the firm has, and try to structure your statements in such a way that your value and vision align with or complement the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s values and vision. I think if you start doing that two or three months before by doing mock interviews, you will have a good handle on the HR or the cultural interview round. Wonderful, that covers everything I guess. So, moving on, what are things students sitting for placements next year can do from now until December to maximize their chances of getting through a company in this sector? First, candidates need to be specific about which profile or domain they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re targeting. Many candidates on our campus are flexible and are trying to land in multiple domains and profiles. For them, I would suggest practicing general problems like guesstimates, puzzles, quantitative problems, aptitude questions, and problems that can be framed around statements you mention or gonna mention on your resume._x000D_\n_x000D_\nOne should use each and every second wisely. Your resume is your key, you should invest more than an ample amount of time in shaping or structuring it. Start practicing and honing each of the skills you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re mentioning there. Make sure your resume would look filled, complete, and make sense for the specific domain. If it doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t, you have time to make it look so. A product management or similar role internship in your resume will increase your chances of getting shortlisted, so you can start seeking them so that your resume showcases the relevant keywords. You can search those through Wellfound (AngelList), Internshala, Linkedin Jobs, The Product Folks slack channel, or reach out to alumni in various startups or firms preferably using linkedin for the availability of an internship opportunity._x000D_\n_x000D_\nComing to the product domain in saas, try to get updated with the major trends and happenings in the market\/industry. You can read newsletters or hear to podcasts. I personally follow the Economic Times, especially their Morning Brief, Lenny\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Newsletter, Finshots, Strategy Simplified, and This Week in Startups. The product domain involves the intersection of multiple fields, so if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re a jack of all trades you will have an advantage, but you still have to be a master of few. Due to the same, it also involves lots of jargon especially technical or related to the business and financial side. I suggest candidates should start reading books along with the newsletters and podcasts I mentioned. Especially if someone is recruiting from a technical university for a product role, they expect us to be better in the technical stack, and the development cycle and hope us to understand the basic technical jargon. So even for a product role, a little bit of technical understanding is a must. Technical understanding doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t necessarily mean you have to code. There are plenty of options available to read, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Swipe to Unlock\u00e2\u20ac\u009d is a good book to gain clarity about these buzzwords._x000D_\n_x000D_\nAlso, start to understand the product buzzwords in-depth, and what sub-elements they have. You can try the Unacademy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Relevel exam for APM to just access which area you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re unaware of and then can learn and practice the same from plenty of resources available online. Candidates should also start reading product books like \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Decode and Conquer\u00e2\u20ac\u009d and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Cracking PM Interviews.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d These are some basic books that candidates must cover because going through these books gives clarity on how to speak in product interviews, and how case studies and RCAs are handled._x000D_\n_x000D_\nPM School also has a case study book with four e-volumes where all the winning participants\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 submissions are included. I suggest going through that to have a clear understanding of what kind of solution to propose. If asked about a particular problem, candidates can surely structure a go-to solution. They may not have the best solution as that takes time to think, but they will surely have something to speak on if asked about how to improve or what to do in product-related questions. I suggest practicing at least one case study a week from now until October or November till the placements\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 filtering tests start. PM School and Product Folks are good channels for practicing case studies. Other platforms like Unstop have many competitions, hackathons, and product case challenges. Candidates should pick at least two case studies a month to practice, get them reviewed by their peers and seniors, ask for their feedback, and then learn and evolve in the product line. All right. Very well explained, Aniket. Furthermore, how did your preparation for product case rounds evolve, once you were shortlisted? I started preparing for case rounds around mid of October, with a group of friends who were also having similar interests. I suggest that forming a group of 3\u00e2\u20ac\u201c4 peers who are also preparing for product, consulting, or in general case studies would be beneficial and way better than solo preparation._x000D_\n_x000D_\nIn general, case studies involve basic pre-defined strategic frameworks, and then at the top of that, you have to recreate your way of working or seeing things. We started with the basic conventional ones like pricing, market growth\/entry, and profitability, etc before jumping into product case studies, RCAs, etc. Nowadays, there are plenty of case books and resources available, but one should start in an old-school way only. We started with Victor Cheng Lectures by the mid of October and then shifted to the IITB casebook and then to the SRCC Case Compendium and Bury the Hatchet till mid of November. We solved each case as an actual interview round and assessed each other. This helped us to understand the interviewer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s mindset and to tackle those from the interviewee\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s perspective. We asked each other questions and provided honest feedback to improve our way of communicating, strategizing, and presenting. We discussed our strengths and weaknesses to identify areas where we needed to focus more and then worked on the same. By the time our end-semester examinations started, I adopted the product bible book for product case studies. The preparation was similar to the previous case rounds preparation. Product candidates should also look at the PM School E-Casebook consisting of the winner\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s participation, distributed in 4 volumes._x000D_\n_x000D_\nHowever, if someone is a newbie in the product domain, it is better to start at least four to five months before the actual preparation. Since we had prior preparation, we dedicated approximately one and a half months to product case study preparation, and I think that was good enough. Right. So these were some of the basic questions from our side, before concluding, anything else that you would want to share with the students in general? If your placements are in the next semester, there are some key things that you should keep in mind to ensure that you start on the right foot. One of the most important things is to start working on your resume early on. I suggest dedicating 10 to 12 days exclusively to the resume. Waiting until the last minute can lead to a lot of problems, so it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s best to start early. Make sure to have every line reviewed by your friends, seniors, or industry experts to ensure that it showcases your strengths for the role you are targeting. When it comes to listing or speaking about your experience, use the STAR approach. Explain the objective of the situation, the actions you took, the tasks you were given, and the results you achieved. Connect the dots in your resume and make sure it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s structured properly. Avoid using jargon or random buzzwords; instead, keep it simple, specific, and understandable._x000D_\n_x000D_\nIn addition to working on your resume, you will also have classes and midterms to prepare for. I recommend starting your strict preparation for placements months in advance, even as soon as the next semester starts. Get everything you are submitting whether it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a resume or a case study deck, reviewed by seniors or industry experts to improve your chance of getting selected. Participate in competitions, network as much as you can, and take some time to understand your strengths and weaknesses._x000D_\n_x000D_\nDon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t wait too long to start preparing, as your tests will start in early October. Be proactive and make the most of opportunities from platforms like Linkedin and the campus chain to network and learn. Remember, networking can provide great benefits in the long run. Dig out some time for yourself, understand yourself, and what you are good at, be patient, and don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t give up and I guess that is all. Good things take time. Thank you so much, Aniket. It was a great time for me to talk with you. I believe everyone would highly benefit from this and yeah, we wish you a happy journey ahead.. Thank you, that was a very nice initiative by Communique, I hope I will be of some help.

Hello Debraj, Good Afternoon; how are you doing today? Hello, Arka! I am fine, and you? What was the general selection process for the companies you interviewed? Please mention the number of rounds and the nature of the selection process. Yeah, so I will talk about consulting companies in general. So, the consulting companies that come on campus, they had opened their portal of CV submission through ERP around 1st week of October. So, people have to submit their CVs in three-four days. The CV shortlisting process took up to 2\u00e2\u20ac\u201c3 weeks. So, by the 3rd week of October, CV shortlisting was done. Then, according to your CVs, they allot you buddies who are recent graduates from college and working in the company. This buddy process goes up to 1\u00e2\u20ac\u201c1.5 months, during which your buddy helps you with everything regarding the preparation. After that, around last week of November, Day 0 happened. You have to go through 2 interviews. One is at the manager level, and the final interview is at the partner level. And you have to get \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcYes\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 from both interviews, then only you will be selected. Regarding the second question, Can you give some insights about the CV shortlisting process? So, I would say that the CV shortlisting process is the most important thing in the consulting sector. Because around 600\u00e2\u20ac\u201c700 applications come from Kgp. And hardly only 7\u00e2\u20ac\u201c8 get shortlisted. So only 1% of CVs get selected. The kind of thing that companies look into the CV is that the individual should be well-rounded. He\/she shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be one-dimensional. Also, the CV should portray that the individual has done impactful work in which field he\/she had worked. So you have to create an impactful CV. They look for spikes in the CV. The common spikes are like 9+CG, having a PPO, etc. So they quantitatively evaluate your CV based on these things Could you please list down the questions you were asked in the different rounds? Puzzles, technical questions, or any other discussion in general that you think will prove to be helpful for students. In the interview round, there are no technical questions as such. The consulting interviews are oriented around two main things, one is case interview questions and the other is personal experience\/Fit questions Now, what are some of the FAQs in most companies that you face and think students must definitely prepare for? More specifically, in the context of HR rounds. Sure, some common frequently asked questions are to give your introduction or walk me through your resume. They generally give 30sec to walk through your resume. So you have to tell everything that you have done or what you have mentioned in your resume. Next, a very popular question is why consulting. So, if you are coming from another domain, e.g., you have your previous internship in finance, or SDE, then why are you sitting for a consulting interview? And finally, you could also go through the website of Bain, BCG, McKinsey. They have a list of common HR questions that are frequently asked. Alright, so moving ahead, this is for the students who will be sitting for the placements in the upcoming placement season. What are things students sitting for placements next year can do from now until December to maximize their chances of getting through a company in this sector? Yeah, correct. I think there is a lot of time from now until December. So students who want to get into this sector should have a properly structured plan. Firstly, the main focus should be on making a proper CV with enough spikes. For that they will need to utilize the summer break if they feel their CV is a bit light now. They can do different kinds of interns, projects, or some impactful work. After building the CV, around July-August, they should look for case partners. And finally, start doing mock case practice with your case partners all the way until placements start. Also, prepare for personal experience level questions. And I think now you are good to go for the interview. So, you mentioned the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcbuddy process.\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Can you tell me something about the buddy process? Sure, this is one unique feature of consulting selection processes. The companies, after reviewing the CVs, allot you buddies. As I mentioned before, the buddies are recent graduates from IIT Kgp. The company allots you a senior buddy\/junior buddy depending upon the company. The buddies are there to help you with all aspects of your preparation. Also, the buddy solves any other doubts like what consulting is, what happens in the company, what is the exact work of consultants, etc. The buddy process is usually non-evaluative, and if anything is evaluated, they will say that that well beforehand. But, my suggestion would be to be clear on what conversations you will have with your buddy beforehand and prepare well. Also, make a good image of yourself in the mind of your buddy as soon as possible. You can also do a mock interviews with your buddy once or twice a week. They will also suggest you about what to do or how to improve. So you shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t hesitate and keep asking your doubts if you have. Okay, so, anything else that you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d want to share with the students? Regarding preparation, I would like to say that the student should be serious and he\/she should have a proper structured plan of preparation for next couple of months. Next, talk to seniors who have gone through the interview process. Also talking about resources, there is a common drive of consulting resources popularly used in the past by KGP students. I have also created a drive of my own which has additional resources. Here is the link. My last suggestion will be to start preparing as early as possible. Because the culture of consulting is growing in kgp and that is why more consulting companies are coming to kgp. Similarly, the competition will be more tough Back to list","category":"Placement","profile":"Consulting","department":"Industrial and Systems Engineering"},{"blog_id":77,"blog_text":"Keertimaan nayak Placed at Kotak Interviewed By: Ananya Hello Keertimaan! This is Ananya from Communiqu\u00c3\u00a9. Congratulations on being placed at Kotak. I will be asking you a few questions about the selection process, so shall we start? Hello Ananya! Thank you for your congratulations. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m more than happy to answer your questions. Please go ahead and ask your questions. So first of all, what was the general selection process for the company? Also, the number of rounds and the nature of the interview process? I had an interview with 3 companies that were Rakuten Inc, Kotak Mahindra and Axis Bank on the same day. So it was a hectic schedule but the placement drive for Kotak Mahindra was a seamless process._x000D_\n_x000D_\nThe general process for Kotak Mahindra consisted of a CV shortlist process at the beginning. Then they had an interview process that consisted of two rounds simultaneously, the first round being the Technical round which was then followed by a personal interview round. The major focus was on the Technical round that consisted of Guesstimates, Puzzles as well as questions on Product improvement or design and also estimation and problem solving. Normally many companies for the product role have a deck submission process where we first have to submit a product deck, that later on gets shortlisted and we are eventually sent for further rounds. Okay, that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s awesome. So moving on, could you please list down some questions that you were asked in the different rounds, like puzzles and other discussions in general that you think will be helpful for the students? Initially I was asked to solve a guesstimate. As I was sitting for the process of Kotak so the question was related to it. I was asked to estimate the number of people that are going on a foreign trip or vacation and would take foreign travel credit cards from us. The main thing in solving the question is to first clarify the doubts or ifs and buts related to the problem. For example whether we have to consider people going on trips throughout the year or just during summer or winter or the people that are going will be a family or a couple or a single person and whether we need to consider one credit card per family. There are several questions that might arise and we must be good enough to discuss all of them with the interviewer and then get on with the estimation. Normally the interviewer is friendly enough to clear all the doubts related to the statement. Then after getting cleared with the statement we can solve it. One of the major things to keep in mind while answering the statement is that we have to discuss every step with the interviewer and let him run through the whole flow of our solution. We shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t directly jump to our final answer at once. That creates a bad impression. I was also asked to solve a puzzle which was easy. Then I was asked to do a product improvement by also providing a product solution for an existing product. Then I was asked about my previous internship experience as a Product Manager. It included many technical questions related to my work. We need to be clear with what we did during our internship period and also be clear about the metrics of the product one worked on. One of the major things that strengthens your chance to get a product manager role is that you have to let the interviewer know about the percentage improvement in the business metrics because of you and what all measures and steps you took. We should be clear with discussing the contributions and also the improvement in metrics with the interviewer. It increases the chance for the interviewer to know about you and get to know about your ideas in certain situations. Apart from this I was asked a few HR questions which were pretty easy to handle as I had prepared for such questions. That gives us a great idea of everything, I guess. So moving on, what are some of the frequently asked questions in most companies that you face and think students must definitely prepare for? More specifically in the context of HR rounds? In technical rounds specifically for Product Role students have to have a good practice of puzzles and guesstimates. Guesstimates are the method by which any organization or the interviewer checks your capability of handling new situations, and how you manage to come out of these questions. So the more practice in this type of questions ensures that more exposure you have to such types of questions. There are 42 Puzzles on Geek for Geeks which are a must solve if you are sitting for any role in placement. For HR Rounds the most important preparation is that you have an idea about all types of HR questions and you have your best possible answer prepared for it beforehand. You don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t need to mug up the answers for all HR questions, rather have a basic frame for every question. The HR questions that are asked by most of the companies are always pretty common questions. Wonderful, that covers everything I guess. So, moving on, what are things students sitting for placements next year can do from now to maximize their chances of getting through a company in this sector? If students are preparing for a product role for next year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s placement the most important thing they should focus on now is to solve as many puzzles and guesstimates. And apart from this the most major thing is to practice questions on product improvement, product design, problem solution, metrics. These are the major things the student needs to have a practice of before placement drive. There is a site named PMExercises that has around 400+ product improvement, problem solution, product design questions along with solutions that will help us carve our thinking and solutions in the right way. For puzzles the book Heard On the Street is the best as it has covered all types of puzzles._x000D_\n_x000D_\nApart from this the company or the interviewer mainly looks for Product Mindset and Data proficiency of a student during the interview. So many questions are asked to gauge your understanding of how a product works. They also want to know about your data proficiency so they normally ask about the amount the data you have worked on during previous work experience. All right. Very well explained. Furthermore, how did your preparation for product case rounds evolve, once you were shortlisted? After I got to know about the interview, I prepared more for the HR questions as I was well prepared for my technical round so I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t need to work on it. I just went through the frameworks for solving guesstimates and also the values that we need to remember related to guesstimates. Apart from that I revised all the main puzzle questions. Then as said my main focus was on HR questions so I went through all of them and had answers in my head that best suited my profile and also aligned with my technical skills. Right. So these were some of the basic questions from our side, before concluding, anything else that you would want to share with the students in general? Apart from all of this I would ask the students to have timely practice and also have practiced as many number of problems as possible on product improvement cases with help of which they can be more sure on how to solve cases or product problems or provide a solution. At the end of the day of the interview it is just about how much we interact with the interviewer and let him know about all of our technical skills through problem solving. Be free and confident enough such that you ace interviews with ease.

And today we have Mr. Snehal Swadhin who has been placed at Ather Energy as a product analyst. Hello Snehal, first of all congratulations for the placement, how are you doing today? Hello Snehal! Thank you very much. I am fine, and you? I am fine as well. So, basically, in this short interview, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll ask you a few questions for our product-oriented blog series. The blog will be shared with the KGP community to guide them about the selection procedure through your experience. So,if you are ready, can we start? Yeah, Snehal. Let\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s begin. So here goes the first question. What was the general interview process for the companies you interviewed? Please mention the number of rounds and the nature of the interview process For Ather energy, it was a basic aptitude test in the beginning, along with CV shortlisting for the product role. Later, the interview happened offline in Nalanda itself. We had three rounds for the interview. Two of them were on CV and cases and the third round was an HR round. These things don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t exactly go as planned. You can see the course of that interview changing a lot during the interview itself. So it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not a fixed procedure. Sometimes people can have more than three, four rounds also. The first round was supposed to be on the CV and technical skills only. And, the second round was supposed to be an entire case round. We were given an initial case study problem before the interview process started. We were given time to prepare for it. But during the process of the interview, the interviewer started questioning about other things as well. The case that we were provided before the interview was \u00e2\u20ac\u201d \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Let\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s say you use Google Maps every day, right? But if you are local in a city, then you already know the ways of going around the city, right? So why would we, why would you use Google Maps?\u00e2\u20ac\u009d As a product analyst, you have to figure out how you can incentivize these things to your users, to use Google Maps, even if they are a local in that city. So those things we had to prepare beforehand, and they were asked in the case itself, along with cross-questioning of course. Thanks for the briefing about the process. Could you please list down questions you were asked in the different rounds? Puzzles, technical questions, any other discussion in general that you think will prove to be helpful for students. Product roles in general, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll say, are more focused in testing your problem solving skills and communication skills. So puzzles and questions will be based around that. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s it._x000D_\n_x000D_\nIn my case, the first round, what\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s supposed to be on my CV and technical skills, the kinds of internships I have done, what were the things I learned from those and of course, to test whether, how dedicatedly I worked on those internships. There were even questions on the technical things like SQL and other technologies that I had used during that internship. So the CV part will obviously be asked, but they will focus on how you have developed yourself during those internships and projects and how it would be useful for their company. And in the first round itself, another case came up. Because of the things I had done during my internship, the interviewer asked the case related to their company, how that translates. The question was \u00e2\u20ac\u201d \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If there is an experience center for Ather Energy, where people will come and test your vehicle, (the EV scooter). There are three kinds of stakeholders there \u00e2\u20ac\u201d One is the customer itself, one is the employee in the experience center and the third is the business unit.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d I was tasked to build a dashboard which would be used by these employees and the business units to improve the customer experience and to help them in the selling process. These kinds of things can be related to your CV and turned around in a way their company would be using it \u00e2\u20ac\u201d puzzles, etc. In other interviews, not specifically in the case of Ather Energy, you would obviously be asked, guesstimates other things. That was insightful. Coming to the next question, What are some of the FAQs in most companies that you faced and think students must definitely prepare for? More specifically, in the context of HR rounds. I guess the most frequent question I was asked in these HR rounds was my role in these projects, and POR\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s that I worked in. In places where I had mentioned that I was in a leadership role, they asked about what I did as a leader and what I brought to the team. Those kinds of things were most frequent. And the questions that you hear about during your junior years, like \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Where do you think you will be in five years\u00e2\u20ac\u009d, those kinds of questions are not generally asked. They are more focused on the kind of person you are and how you work in a team environment?What kind of things have you mentioned in your CV? Those are more frequently asked than gimmick questions._x000D_\n_x000D_\nThey asked multiple questions, but the most time was spent on one thing. I had participated in the Smart India High Hackathon and I was the team leader for my team and we won the first prize for that problem statement that we were working on. So they spent around 10 to 15 minutes asking about my role as a team leader and how I handled bad situations which happened during the process of the hackathon itself because it went on for months. And we were a team of six.They were trying to see how I was able to handle problematic situations that came up during the process. So moving ahead, what are things students sitting for placements next year can do from now until December to maximize their chances of getting through a company in this sector? Preparing for product roles, the two things that you should focus on mostly right now are guesstimates and case studies. If you can try to participate in case study events like during Kshitij or Great Step, etc, it will be useful. There are casebooks for multiple companies, one is very famous from AT Kearney and an author named Victor Cheng, his book is also read very frequently. So these things are useful. People can try to use resources on the internet as well because there are a lot of YouTube videos which highlight how case interviews go._x000D_\n_x000D_\nSo you can try to search for mock case interviews, search questions about these things online. Try to meet with seniors and have mock case interviews with them. These things will help improve your thinking process and even your communication skills during the interview. Communication is a thing that cannot be improved just overnight. So if you have time till placement, these things should be focused and if you have a lack of communication skills, you should be working on that. The second thing was guesstimates. Guesstimates are also frequently asked during these product interviews. So, those are very crucial things as well. Alright, so moving ahead, how did your preparation for technical rounds evolve once you were shortlisted? Preparing for a product domain is much easier than any other which you will come across. Like for software and data roles you have to practice coding and machine learning, those kinds of things but for product roles it is much simpler. You just have to improve your thinking process and communication skills and practice case studies. It is best done with real people rather than reading it online. So the best thing you can do is talk to seniors who are working and have experience in this field. The technical side depends on your particular CV. The technical questions are not generally outside of whatever you have already put in your CV. You would be already prepared for that as you have worked on the projects. Thanks for the answer. Anything else that you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d want to share with the students? I recommend people to prepare for at least two roles. More than that would be difficult but prepare for at least two domains. I was preparing for software and product roles both, so as to maximize your chances during the CDC placement and as a situation is not quite certain right now in the tech domain. Product is a good field to look out for. The placement process of our college is very hectic so it is best that you make your preparations during this time when the test and all the other processes have not started because once the semester starts you will not have enough time to manage your academics and continue preparing for whatever role you are preparing for. Try to finish the major part of the preparation before the semester starts and try to have good time management with your academics and placements. The placements, I believe were one of the most hectic times I experienced during my life. So prepare well and manage efficiently! Thanks a lot for your suggestions. With this, the interview comes to an end. Alright Snehal, it was great talking to you and knowing your experiences and insights. Thank You. It was a pleasure being interviewed.

First of all congratulations on being placed at Mckinsey. So, let\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s get started with our interview. Beginning with the most frequently asked question, What was the general interview process for the companies you interviewed? Please mention the number of rounds and the nature of the interview process. Thank you Bhavya.So, I had around eight shortlists on Day-0 and Day-1 combined and I ended up giving interviews for three companies on Day-0 itself which were MCKINSEY, BAIN and FLIPKART APM. I accepted the offer from McKinsey & Company. Since my primary profile is Consulting, I would like to stick to Mckinsey and Bain. For the Flipkart apm, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll just give the overview of the process. It is a three-step process. First is a pitch deck submission, where they ask you to come up with a product idea. Once you are shortlisted in the deck submission and resume round, there will be a buddy process which is common between consult and apm profiles and then there are interviews. Mckinsey and Bain also follow a three step process. The first round is the resume shortlisting round. Once you upload your resume on the CDC portal, it normally takes around 7-10 days for the interview shortlists to be out. The second step includes a case workshop and buddy process where you are introduced to the process of case interviews and we go about having buddy rounds. Buddies are essentially people who are 2-3 years into the firm, normally seniors from our own college. They help you through the interview process, guide you as to how you should approach the entire preparation phase because they have been through the same. You are always advised to use the buddy process very tactfully. From my experience, Mckinsey has a completely non-evaluative buddy process. Even Bain had a non-evaluative process. However, companies like Arthur D' Little stated explicitly that their buddy process is evaluative. _x000D_\nComing to the third step, it is the interview which usually happens on Day-0 or Day-1. I sat for both Mckinsey and Bain. Both of them had two rounds each. For Mckinsey, both the rounds were partner rounds. Partners are essentially people who are at the top of the firm, who are responsible for bringing in clients and also are representatives of a consulting firm. For Bain, one round was with a senior manager and the other was with a partner. Senior managers oversee most of the case process and drive the case work on ground. This was the general process. Could you please list down the questions that were asked in the different rounds? Or any discussion in general that you think will prove to be helpful for students. Right, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll talk about my two Mckinsey rounds. Both of those have a typical format. In Mckinsey case interviews, there are three things that they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll ask you - _x000D_\n_x000D_\n1)Firstly, they will focus on your personal experience interview (PEI ~ first 10 minutes)_x000D_\n2)Second is about case interviews (20-25 minutes) and_x000D_\n3)Third, they ask you if you have any questions for them. (3-5 minutes) _x000D_\n_x000D_\nResponses to all three are highly scrutinized and hence should be taken very seriously by the candidates. _x000D_\nThe personal experience interview is similar to the HR interview. They asked me what I considered was my biggest achievement and my biggest failure. They also asked me to narrate an incident where I was able to resolve a conflict in a work environment. These are important questions from Mckinsey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stand point because they try to gauge two things- _x000D_\n_x000D_\n1) If you can adhere to the values that Mckinsey appreciates, and_x000D_\n2)If you are an interesting person to talk to, in general. This is primarily important because consultants are normally required to take long flights with each other and hence being a person with interesting life experiences helps your candidature._x000D_\n_x000D_\nThe second part was the case interview. In my first round at Mckinsey, I was given to solve a guesstimate which was on the number of houses that will be sold in India in 2022. This was a rather simple guesstimate but they grilled me a lot on two fronts - first was on the numbers I assumed, and second was on the final figure I arrived at. They made a few counter statements to see if I can defend the assumptions I made. So, you have to be very sure about the assumptions you are making. Once I reached the final figure, they asked me to sense-check. So if you come up with an answer for the guesstimate, they ask you to make sense out of that number and state if it's a reasonable figure. You need to use your approximation skills there._x000D_\nThe third part is also highly evaluative. You need to prepare properly for the questions that you are asking the interviewer. Going through their website, talking to alumni, and following current affairs related to the company you're aiming for - will help you in preparing a good set of questions._x000D_\nIn my Mckinsey round-2, I was given a case about a financial stock brokerage firm facing reduced profitability and I had to figure out the root cause behind this and give some recommendations. _x000D_\nGeneral pointers about these companies is that, there are two things they focus on quite a lot. There is high preference given to resumes. So, your resume has to be on-point. And you have to be very structured about your approach to answer a question. A rule of thumb is to follow MECE structuring which is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Mutually exclusive and Cumulatively exhausting\u00e2\u20ac\u009d structuring. You can learn more about this through various consult books that are referenced at the end of the blog. What are some of the FAQs in most companies that you faced and think students must definitely prepare for? More specifically in the context of HR rounds. They always ask general questions such as \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcIntroduce yourself\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcWalk me through your CV.\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, but the most important questions that I found specifically to Mckinsey were - \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcIdentify your biggest success and biggest failure.\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcTell us about a time when you were able to resolve a conflict between peers.\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 This can be also asked like \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcTell us about a time when you were able to resolve a conflict between you and a senior when you went against a senior\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s opinion and proved your point.\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 What are things students sitting for placements next year can do from now until December to maximize their chances of getting through a company in this sector? So, for people who are sitting for placements in the coming December, I think the two things they can focus on are - resume building and developing business sense. _x000D_\nYou need to know where your resume currently lacks, and try to fill that gap._x000D_\nIf it's late to find new PORs, a great internship might help. _x000D_\nA great internship will either have relevant work (VCs or product interns) or a very good brand(Google\/P&G\/SLB). Having a CDC intern in a great brand will definitely add to your CV. _x000D_\nThe second thing you can do is try to develop finance\/business acumen by subscribing to youtube channels or news articles like \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcEconomic Times\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. You should extensively start practicing cases 30-40 days before your interviews. How did your preparation for technical rounds evolve once you were shortlisted? Right, once you are shortlisted you are in the end game since there are only a few people with you extensively preparing for the interviews. My strategy was to focus a lot on PEI questions (HR part) because I was told that Mckinsey values that a lot. My friends would ask me questions from various HR books or questions they could think of and I would try to answer them. In these answers, I would follow a STAR-L format which is the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcSituation-Task-Action-Result-Learning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 format. This is a very good way to structure your HR answers and is something that should always be followed. I also used to practice at least one case a day. I was familiar with the case for quite some time so this frequency was ideal. After solving each case, you should focus on analyzing the case, updating your structure based on learnings, write down whatever you have learnt from each case into a separate excel file\/your notebook and revise that file before each case you solve. Anything else that you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d want to share with the students? Yes, in my opinion, placement season is by far the most stressful time that students have to go through on campus. This is primarily because there can be a lot of variables that are just out of your control. Things such as shortlists being very random or exams being conducted at the wrong time or certain tests that don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t go so well, will happen more often than you expect. Such instances might demoralize you. _x000D_\n_x000D_\nIn these times, two things helped me a lot - _x000D_\nA) focusing on the controllables, and _x000D_\nB) focusing on the positive. _x000D_\n_x000D_\nWhenever you are in a situation where there are things you can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t control, you should try not to worry about them, and only focus on doing as much as possible. Know your strengths and try to capitalize on them. Use them to boost your confidence. And most importantly, trust your true friends to help you out in the process. Keep your companions around, and talk to them about how you're feeling. One good strategy, generally used in interviews, is to try to drive the interview towards your strengths. You can always talk about things that you are good at, nudging the interviewer to ask you about those topics. Thank you Abhyudaya! That was a great interview. Thank you for your time. Thank You. It was a pleasure being interviewed.

First of all, congratulations to you for securing your placement at Boston Consulting Group. Thank you so much. Lets begin First off, what was the general interview process for the companies you interviewed? Please mention the number of rounds and the nature of the interview process. OK. So for my placement, I was preparing for consulting and finance profiles. BCG was one of my target firms and fortunately they came early for campus recruiting in August and hence I did not have to sit for other firms. The general interview process for Consulting firms is the same. There is a CV shortlist, followed by 2 weeks of buddy rounds and finally 3\u00e2\u20ac\u201c4 rounds of Interviews by Senior Management on the final day._x000D_\n_x000D_\nI had 2 buddies assigned to me who helped me prepare for the final day post the CV shortlisting. The buddies practice a few case interviews with you, providing valuable feedback and tips on how to perform on the final day. On my final day, I had 4 rounds of interviews, starting at 8 AM. The first 2 rounds were taken by a Principal & a Project Leader. The final two rounds were taken by MD&Ps. All rounds generally involve a general introduction and a candid conversation followed by a case interview taken by the interviewer to judge the candidate\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s prowess. Every round is eliminative and feedback is passed on between each rounds to ensure an overall assessment of the candidate. Got it. Could you please list down the questions you were asked in different rounds? Puzzles, technical questions, some particular Guesstimate case you remember till now and any other discussion in general which would help which would be helpful for the students who are preparing for placements this year. So it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been a while, so I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t exactly remember the questions, However if I remember broadly, my first round was a Profitability Product case on the Hyperlocal Delivery market. My second round was extremely candid where I bonded with the interviewer on our shared passion for Football and Finance, and he asked me to do a Breakeven Analysis involving Guesstimates for a Football Club recently in the news. My first Managing Director & Partner Round involved a Profitability case on the Automobile Industry and my final round was a Pressure Test\/Guesstimate on the Steel Industry._x000D_\n_x000D_\nIn general, candidates might or might not have a specific HR round. In my case, my second and final round were very situational, however it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s very likely that one would be asked a case problem in every round, so it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s necessary to be prepared well with the various types of case interview methodologies. Apart from this, please be very candid and confident with the interviewer as they are really looking forward to knowing you and understanding why you would like to work for the firm. What are some frequently asked questions in most companies that you faced and think student must definitely prepare for more specifically in context of hr rounds? In the context of HR rounds, Consulting Firms place a high emphasis on the cultural fit of the candidate with the firm\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s values. Thus, it is important to be well prepared to answer questions like why Consulting? Why BCG? Where do you see yourself in 5 years? ,etc. It is suggested to be honest, do ample research about the firm and build a gripping story as to what led you to making this choice and how you want to make the most out of it. Got it, What are the things students sitting for placement next year can do to maximize until December to maximise the chances to getting into a company in this sector, especially as consulting companies come before the placement transition during July from July? So for Consulting, we can break the procedure into two parts, getting the shortlist & clearing the interview rounds. I personally feel the first part is the most difficult one. Please have a v1 of your resume ready, post your summer internship and send it out for reviews to seniors. The feedback is highly crucial to the improvements that can result in a shortlist. Consulting resumes are famous for being very attention to detail and impact-based and hence it takes time and a lot of feedback to arrive at the final version._x000D_\n_x000D_\nIn order to clear the interview rounds, candidates have to be well versed with the various case interview frameworks & methodologies. Generally preparation can be started by forming Case groups with fellow interviewees 2.5\u00e2\u20ac\u201c3 months before the final day of the interview for a comfortable schedule. One can start practicing cases, once well versed with the frameworks from notable casebooks available on the internet like CIC & Day One. I would personally recommend two other casebooks from IIM A & SRCC as they cover multiple industries and cover MECE frameworks very well. Can you please suggest some YouTube channels on case guesstimates to the people who are sitting for placements which they can try for the last three months. Yeah sure. So Case Interviews Cracked (CIC) by IIT Bombay is the starting point for most beginners and it provides a very satisfactory introduction to case interviews and how to solve them particularly from an Indian context. Apart from this, I found a particular channel called Crafting Cases extremely useful. They have multiple YT videos, free courses and teach crucial concepts like how to be MECE in every step which is a differentiating element in your case interviews. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll move forward with the next question. How did your preparation for different rounds evolve once you were shortlisted? It is a follow up for the previous. Right, so once you are shortlisted, you get an idea about the rest of the candidates as well. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s essential to form a case group now if you haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t already. I was a part of a case group of 3 people where we practiced 1\u00e2\u20ac\u201c3 cases between each other everyday covering various types & industries. It is extremely important to be brutally honest for feedback and collaborative to ensure mutual growth. I practiced a few cases, outside my case group with the rest of the shortlisted candidates to learn different approaches taken by them. This time is very crucial to make the most out of the cases you can practice with your buddy and learn from the feedback provided by them. Try doing cross-buddy cases if you have the time as well. Keep your case-sheets handy and keep on revising them and try to understand how you could have performed better. I would advise to revise more and brainstorm new approaches to old cases than to keep on solving new ones. You anything else you want to share with the students? Regarding this, I think with respect to KGP, currently there has been a boom in consulting. A lot of people have been aiming for the profile. One of the things that I would like to share is the importance of networking in this profile. People really miss out because they don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t talk to a lot of seniors who have secured offers and know how to build a profile for a shortlist_x000D_\n_x000D_\nSince Consulting shortlists depend heavily on a system of spikes, every shortlisted candidate has something special about their CV resulting in the same. Hence, it would be useful to understand how a recruiter\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s mindset might work by looking at the various CVs of shortlisted candidates and engaging in conversation with them regarding their thought process on choosing Consulting. Great, Sankalp can i ask you a different question, why consulting? Interesting question, so I was exposed to Consulting as a field from my first year itself. I participated in Case Study competitions and being part of two societies where most of the seniors I looked up to ended up in the same field definitely piqued my interest. Consulting was a field that really values one\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s all round development and leadership abilities. I feel my trajectory in college was similar in taking up internships & PORs that built a profile suited for Consulting. I talked to seniors working in the profile and developed a serious liking towards the work they were doing, the growth potential and the lifestyle. Hence, I started working hard towards securing an offer from my pre-final year and thankfully ended up with one. It was good to hear that Sankalp. As you mentioned about the recent glamor in KGP, for consulting. Any words of advice and guidance for aspirants in this domain? Sure, I would like to say that honestly from my perspective, Consulting firms really value individuals who have worked hard and excelled at fields that they are passionate for. The people I have looked up to before have been those who have lived their KGP life to the maximum, making the most of the multitude of opportunities available here. Hence, I would really advise incoming enthusiasts to really pursue their passion diligently and excel in their fields. If you are good at Sports\/SoCult\/Tech try making it to Inter IIT, participate in competitions, take up leadership positions and maintain a good academic profile. In general, try to do well in every endeavor you take up and that should be something that would be rewarded by the Consulting firms while shortlisting. Got it Sankalp. So I guess with this we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll end our interview. It was nice talking to you, Sankalp. Have a good day. Thank you again.It was really insightful interview. Do you have any questions which you wanted to add on other than this? No Sudeep. I think that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s OK.

And today we have Ms. Shambhavi Dhote who has been placed at Ather Energy as a product analyst. So, basically, in this short interview, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll ask you a few questions for our product-oriented blog series. The blog will be shared with the KGP community to guide them about the selection procedure through your experience. Hello Shambhavi, first of all congratulations for the placement, how are you doing today? Hello Snehal! Thank you very much. I am fine. Let\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s begin. So here goes the first question.What was the general interview process for the companies you interviewed? Please mention the number of rounds and the nature of the interview process. Okay, if I have to say the general interview process, involves two product rounds and the last will be like a mix of product and behavioral. So for different companies, they will vary. So if I start from the first, which I got short-listed for, it was Flipkart which took 3 rounds and in all these rounds questions asked were product based on a mix of product design, improvement, metrics, market entry. So they carry out a one-month session where they guide you on how to prepare for the interview._x000D_\n_x000D_\nIf I have to say for the Microsoft Technical Programme Manager, in that there were two rounds, first was a product round, followed by a system design round. As per the role they were looking for people who will be able to coordinate with the software engineers and have better knowledge in that particular domain and thus it was a bit away from the traditional product management role._x000D_\n_x000D_\nThird was Grow which took around 3 rounds a mix of the various product questions as previously mentioned, more focused towards the financial stream._x000D_\n_x000D_\nThen the fourth was Navi which consisted of two offline rounds.In those two rounds, there was nothing like HR round, it was mostly directed to product questions only and also they were inclined on asking hardware questions._x000D_\n_x000D_\nAnd lastly coming to Ather. In Ather, my first round was based on my technical knowledge as per my profile and problem solving based loosely on my technical and design thinking skills. For the second round, it was dedicated more towards product improvement or designing a new product and my third round comprised of HR and behavioral questions. Thanks for the briefing about the process. Could you please list down questions you were asked in the different rounds? Puzzles, technical questions, any other discussion in general that you think will prove to be helpful for students. Okay, so first for product profile, I believe that you should have basic knowledge of SQL for the technical round. So in product management, they do not expect you to know a lot about the tech knowledge or the coding language as well. But what do they expect is that you have a basic understanding of how tech works. Because as a product manager, you will be managing both counterparts of products._x000D_\n_x000D_\nPuzzles and guesstimates are other sectors which companies focus on. For guesstimates there is the book of communiqu\u00c3\u00a9 : \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcThe Guessing Game\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 and CIC. So it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s like even if you start from now, like guesstimates, you can keep on doing one per day. And it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s very easy and it will be something that will be asked in the interviews for sure. That was insightful. Coming to the next question, What are some of the FAQs in most companies that you faced and think students must definitely prepare for? More specifically, in the context of HR rounds. The questions that are the most asked are like your favorite product? Prepare for the software as well as the hardware product. And you should have a reason. Why do you like this product? And what makes it stand out from other products as well._x000D_\n_x000D_\nSecond would be designing a new product or improving a new product. It can further connect to metrics and market entry questions. These are some of the questions that are asked._x000D_\n_x000D_\nAnd thirdly, there are the general HR questions. They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d be more interested to know why you want to switch into product management. It can come from your internship or the project you did or some competition you participated in. So you should have a strong story line so as to support._x000D_\n_x000D_\nOther than that, for the specific company, you should be well versed with their background, core values, their product(s) as well. So you should have a basic understanding of their products as well. So moving ahead, what are things students sitting for placements next year can do from now until December to maximize their chances of getting through a company in this sector? To align yourself for the role, I believe you can join various cohorts so as to either learn from scratch or polish your knowledge.Other than that, participating in various competitions, doing projects or internships showcase your dedication._x000D_\n_x000D_\nGuys who are preparing for the role should remember that there is no clear crystal line one has to follow. People come from various backgrounds and experiences, learning from them is the key to this role._x000D_\n_x000D_\nBefore placements You should read books, install the products to understand their flows. Constant communication with friends prepping for the role or with people in the product sectors,helps you to gain knowledge and empathy for the product ._x000D_\n_x000D_\nTo prepare for product interviews, \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcPreparing for product interviews\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 is the first book you should go forward with. Second of all, the IIT B case book, which helps you understand how to solve cases in a structured manner in under 30\u00e2\u20ac\u201c40 mins._x000D_\n_x000D_\nThere is this IIMA book called \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcFuturistic outlook to product management\u00e2\u20ac\u2122.\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Cracking the PM interview\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 is another good book._x000D_\n_x000D_\nIn Product, interviewers really like it if you have empathy for the users. So understanding UX is important and something you can read into. It can also help in deck making. You can also refer to PM school and exponent in youtube, to help you prepare and practice and solve case studies. Alright, so moving ahead, how did your preparation for technical rounds evolve once you were shortlisted? I have a major design background. So I was not a very technical person per say. But I read and did some coding as well. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d say SQL was something that I started learning once I came back to campus in my fifth year. It was very early on. And I read the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcSwipe to Unlock\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 which helped me get a grip of theoretical knowledge. I did a course in ML (A-Z ML course from Udemy) a year back. I believe those were sufficient for me to crack the technical rounds. Thanks for the answer. Anything else that you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d want to share with the students? I think placements are close enough now and my suggestion would be to prepare a daily routine which helps you manage time efficiently._x000D_\n_x000D_\nSecond would be to make a list of all your achievements, projects etc for CV making._x000D_\n_x000D_\nYou can also reach out to your seniors on how to better prepare and get feedback._x000D_\n_x000D_\nIts high time you have a niche case group where you can practice 2\u00e2\u20ac\u201c3 cases per week._x000D_\n_x000D_\nPlacement preparation cannot be ideally done, especially the product profile which requires constant communication and constructive feedback to improve. Stay connected and practice with your peers._x000D_\n_x000D_\nAnd spend some time being in constant touch with your family to keep your morals up. I wish all the preparing peeps best of luck for this coming placement season! Thank you so much,Shambhavi. It was a great experience interviewing you. Thanks, Snehal.

Hello Devaki, Good Afternoon; how are you doing today? Hello, Arka! I am fine, and you? I am fine as well. Firstly, the heartiest congratulations to you for getting placed at BCG, one of the topmost management consulting firms in the world. So, basically, in this short interview, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll ask you a few questions for our consult-oriented blog series. The blog will be shared with the KGP community to guide them about the selection procedure through your experience. So, if you are ready, can we start? Yeah, thank you very much, Arka. Let\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s begin. So here goes the first question. What was the general selection process for the companies you interviewed? Please mention the number of rounds and the nature of the selection process. I gave my interview at the Boston Consulting Group(BCG). BCG has conducted their hiring process off-campus this year. Here are the steps involved:_x000D_\n_x000D_\nStep-1: CV submission: You only have a short window to submit your CV, so ensure you have it ready. I started working on my CV immediately after my summer internship, and I even had it verified by some seniors working at various consultancy firms._x000D_\n_x000D_\nStep-2: CV shortlisting: You get the CV shortlists two days after the submission deadline. BCG's CV shortlisting process takes into account a variety of factors, including academic and extracurricular achievements. Certain standout experiences, such as exemplary leadership positions, sports achievements, social and cultural involvement, technological and entrepreneurial endeavors, internships, and projects, can help you stand out from other applicants._x000D_\n_x000D_\nStep-3: Buddy process: BCG assigns a couple of their employees as buddies to help you prepare for the interview. Buddies help you understand the interview process, prepare for the cases, and practice. Both of my buddies were from KGP so with most of the other short-listed candidates. The buddy rounds were non-evaluative and were a way to help you understand the firm and prepare well for the interview._x000D_\n_x000D_\nStep-4: The D\u00e2\u20ac\u201cday(The interview day): I had three evaluative interviews on the final day. It started with the project leader, then the principal, and finally, the partner. You could only move on to the next interview if you passed the previous one. Could you list down questions you were asked in the different rounds? Puzzles, technical questions, or any other discussion in general that you think will be helpful for students. Sure, I will discuss them step by step._x000D_\n_x000D_\nBuddy rounds: In your first interaction with your buddy, you need to introduce yourself. In the buddy rounds, you will typically be asked to solve either guesstimates or cases._x000D_\n_x000D_\nProject lead\/ Principal\/ Partner rounds: Each interview begins with you introducing yourself. Your interviewer may or may not ask you questions based on your CV, depending on their preference. There are no specific HR rounds, and I was not asked any HR questions during my interviews. I was asked to solve guesstimates, profitability, market-entry, and unconventional cases. You may also be asked to solve cases requiring multiple frameworks, such as a mix of market entry and pricing, etc. Interviewers look for your problem-solving, mathematical, and communication skills. That was insightful. Now, what are some of the FAQs in most companies that you face and think students must definitely prepare for? More specifically, in the context of HR rounds. During HR rounds, you should be confident in your introduction and be able to explain your CV without hesitation. You should also be prepared to answer the following questions in a general sense:_x000D_\nWhy are you the best candidate for the job?_x000D_\nWhy are you interested in this profile?_x000D_\nWhy are you interested in this company? Thanks for the answer. Coming to the next question: How did your preparation for technical rounds evolve once you were shortlisted? Since BCG does not have any technical rounds, I will define my preparation strategy after I am shortlisted._x000D_\nI used to practice cases on a daily basis, with my batchmates and seniors who made it to consulting firms. I also practiced guesstimates whenever I had short periods of free time between classes or other activities. I tracked my progress in an Excel sheet and analyzed where I performed well and where I needed more preparation. A case that is not synthesized is useless, so I made sure to update my progress tracker and synthesize the case on the same day before moving on to the next thing on my schedule. Instead of doing a lot of cases, it is better to do quality cases with skilled people who can give you proper feedback. Consistency is key to excellence in case preparation. Alright, so moving ahead, this is for the students who will be sitting for the placements in the upcoming placement season. What are things students sitting for placements next year can do from now until December to maximize their chances of getting through a company in this sector? Your CV is your ticket to the interview stage. Take the time to craft a compelling document that highlights your unique strengths and capabilities. Make sure that your CV highlights the impact you created and the consistency you showcased. Chronology is not essential, but you should highlight your key achievements to leave no stone unturned to get a shortlist._x000D_\nYou can prepare for guesstimates and case interviews in a month. However, what will make you stand out is your industry knowledge. Stay up-to-date on financial news through blogs and podcasts. You should also practice your math skills and be confident in solving problems quickly._x000D_\nBe versed in your CV and HR prep to face any interviewer. Focus on your communication skills and how you present yourself positively. Mock interviews and practicing cases with seniors will help you feel comfortable and confident during your interviews. Okay, so anything else that you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d want to share with the students? If you are unsure which profile to choose, explore different profiles and opportunities before deciding on your career path. Doing projects or internships in a specific field will help you better understand that field. Regardless of your profile, be consistent with your preparation and set daily or weekly goals for yourself. Track your progress and improve your efficiency every day. Feel free to reach out to any seniors to learn more about the profile and see if it is a good fit for your interests._x000D_\nGood luck with your preparation! Feel free to reach out if you have any questions. Thanks a lot for your suggestions. With this, the interview comes to an end. Alright, Devaki, it was great talking to you and knowing your experiences and insights. Thank You. It was a pleasure being interviewed.

Hello Ishan, how are you? I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m doing very well. What about you? I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m fine. Thank you very much. Firstly, huge congratulations to you on getting this internship. It definitely speaks volumes of your hard work and talent. So, in this interview, I shall ask you a few questions for our internship blogs mainly aimed at your preparation for this internship. So, if you are ready, can we start? Yes, definitely! What was the general interview process for the companies you interviewed? Please mention the number of rounds and the nature of the interview process. I mostly prepared for the SDE profile and for the SDE, there are generally 2-3 rounds. First and second rounds are mostly technical rounds and there are questions on competitive programming and puzzles. The third round is the HR round. This is generally the interview process for most of the SDE companies nowadays. Thank you. That was quite insightful. Moving on to the next question, could you please list down questions you were asked in the different rounds? Puzzles, technical questions, any other discussion in general that you think will prove to be helpful for students. I interviewed for two companies. Most of the questions they asked me were from operating systems. It is a topic that most of the SDE aspirants neglect and later regret. Competitive programming is also important, but in my opinion operating systems are the most important. Regarding specific questions, I was asked to code basic questions like \u00e2\u20ac\u0153To reverse a link list\u00e2\u20ac\u009d in APT software interviews, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Find median of two sorted lists\u00e2\u20ac\u009d in Goldman Sachs, etc. I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t remember much of the puzzles, but basic puzzles are asked indeed. You can prepare for them from Interview bit and Brain Steller. Thank you very much. Now, moving onto the third question, what are some of the FAQs in most companies that you faced and think students must definitely prepare for? More specifically, in the context of HR rounds. Mostly the interviewers would be asking you about your strengths and weaknesses and also why you would like to join the company. The basic suggestion would be to read about the company you would want to join in advance. How did your preparation for technical rounds evolve once you were shortlisted? After getting shortlisted, I started mainly focussing on preparing my CV. I went through all the projects that I wrote in it, properly so that I could answer each and every question related to it. This is very important because you need to know your CV and the work you have done. You also need to explain it to the interviewer as well. So, I mainly focussed on my CV. What are things students sitting for placements next year can do from now until December to maximize their chances of getting through a company in this sector? My main suggestion is to practice competitive programming, as that is what the companies see the most. Till the shortlistings, the companies only want to see how good your competitive programming skills are. Only once you are shortlisted do the companies see your profile, your projects, other skills, etc. And I would suggest giving contests, improving your rating and also mentioning that in your CV. This is because it is only competitive programming that helps you get shortlisted. So, I would finally suggest practicing competitive programming a lot. Okay, so would you like to share anything else and provide suggestions to the students? So, I would suggest the students aspiring for SDE profile to stay focussed and hone their programming skills. After that, I would recommend students to look through the topics OOP\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s (Object-oriented programming) and Operating systems, as they are very important as well. This concludes our interview. Thank you very much for your time and also for your most insightful answers. It was great talking to you and knowing about your insights and experiences. Thank you. It was my pleasure.

First of all, my heartiest congratulations to you for bagging an internship at Qualcomm. If I have your consent, may I take a short interview with you? Yeah, sure. So Priyanshu, how and when did you decide that you wanted to get into the core profile? So the core profile was naturally my first choice because I liked the subjects of my department. Moreover, I had a decent enough CGPA at the end of my second year. So I thought that core would be a good profile. I then managed to maintain my CGPA over to the third year, and then I prepared for the core profile. Moving on to the next question, what was the general selection process for the companies that you had given interviews for? Okay, so the general selection process for pretty much every hardware company is the same. There is a test and then followed by a shortlist process that has a weightage of both your CV and test. And then there is an interview round. The interview could span across multiple rounds or could be a one-round affair. So in my case, the interview was of two rounds in both cases. Now moving on to the next and the most common question for anyone sitting for the core profile. Is it true that a high CGPA is required to pursue interests in the core field? So I would say that you should have a decent enough CGPA. So I would say that a mark above 8.2, and 8.3 would be good. That would actually be able to let you sit in some interviews. So the companies that come, so if you talk about companies in hardware like APT, then Google, both of those come either on day 1 or day 2. And then the rest are NVIDIA, Texas, Samsung, and Qualcomm. So all of those companies except the first two companies, require a good CGPA close to 9 or a pretty good CV if you do not have a CGPA. And then the rest of the companies demand a decent CGPA like 8.3, or 8.4. So it's pretty good to have a good CGPA. But in any profile, you want to sit for in CDC. Okay, for example, if anyone has a CGPA of around 8.5. And he\/she is confused between SDE and core. So what would you suggest to him or her? I would say that SDE and core are two very different profiles. So if somebody is interested in both SDE and core, then you just have to choose one based on what he is interested in more. I cannot answer the question exactly for him. But he will just have to choose one and move forward with it. I would say that he can choose software for his internship. And then carry forward in his 3rd and 4th years exploring core more. Because even if he is a B.Tech or dual degree student, he will have time to switch on to core in terms of let's say research work in BTP, MTP, or even in placement if he wants to switch profiles. So he can give the software a try for their internships. And then go to the core if he feels like it. Okay, that was quite an insightful answer. Moving on to the next question. What were the resources that you used during your preparation? And how did they help you? So the resources for core are pretty much integrated well. So the notes that we had for all the subjects that we were taught. So mainly in CDC internships, they revolve around either analog or digital. So both of those notes were there as we had both of those courses during the online semester. So I used class notes basically for those two subjects. Apart from that, there is also a signal processing profile in TI. So for that, I referred to the notes of digital signal processing and signal systems. So your class notes would be enough for any of the interviews or the tests that would come up. Apart from that, there is always a portion of general aptitude. And I've seen people tend to miss or take it easy when it comes to general aptitude. But I'd say that if you want to score really well in the test or be on the edge and not falter in anything. You should also give sufficient time to general aptitude. So for questions in general aptitude, I used sites like GFG. It has a pretty good set of questions. And then even Indiabix has good questions when it comes to general aptitude. So like all companies do not ask for high-level aptitude such as phone companies or let's say good software companies. So sites like these would work. Apart from that, for interviews specifically. There are puzzles from GFG that are very universal. So all of the interviewers and interviews have a common consensus that for the puzzle, any interviewer will ask. For any decent or common company would be some GFG. So I would really recommend all the people studying for CDC to do GFG puzzles. So that would be good. And apart from that, our department also publishes four blogs. That's a blog series for four interception placements. So if you can go through those blogs. So in one of the blogs, one of our seniors gave us a link that had all the preparation materials regarding placements. So that was pretty intensive. So I do not think apart from these resources, you need anything else, not just for internships but for placements as well. Can you list some of the questions that were asked to you during your interview? Okay so in my interview, they asked me a variety of questions. So I had two interviews, one was for APT and the second was for Qualcomm. So in the APT hardware, there were basically two rounds of interviews. And in the first round, there were basically two parts to the interview. So the first part was digital and the second part was Python. So in digital electronics, they started from FIFO depth. And then they moved on to static timing analysis. Then they talked about state diagrams and Moore and Mealy models. Stuff like that. And then they followed it up with some very long codes. So like they gave us very long codes and asked what it would do and what it was trying to achieve. Other than that, yeah that was pretty much for digital. Then they moved on to Python. So in Python, they asked pretty basic questions. Because after all, it's for a hardware profile. And apart from that, not in my interview but in my senior's interview, they asked some questions related to OS as well regarding threads and processes. So OS and stuff is something like even if you don't know, they won't charge you on that. But yeah, basic Python questions would be good if you are trying to get an intern at APT. So like in that case, even if you are studying Python. Then I'd strongly suggest you study classes in Python. And then move on to the implementation of OOPS in Python. So both of these are really like I would say thoroughly covered in interviews and even in the test of APT hardware. So  APT hardware's general approach to interview and test is pretty tangential when it comes to other companies for hardware profiles. Because they have really strong weightage of coding and software kind of stuff. So if you are not preparing for APT, you do not need software after your first-year level stuff. So if you have first-year PDS stuff, then I'd say you could revise that. There are some basic C questions in let's say every interview. Because even hardware profiles require some level of proficiency in C programming. Apart from that, so yeah that would be pretty much it for APT. And for Qualcomm, it was mostly computer architecture-based. So Qualcomm came in for the second time in let's say April. And they asked me about computer architecture. Now Qualcomm, when it came out for the first time did not ask for computer architecture. And usually, companies that hire interns. They do not go into computer architecture that much. But my CV was based on computer architecture, so I think that was the reason. In computer architecture, they asked me some basic things like CPU pipelining and the five stages of CPU pipelining and pipeline hazards. Then some CV-related questions followed by some puzzles from GFG again and general coding and aptitude questions. That was pretty much it. Priyanshu, you mentioned you had two interviews, of which the offer letter of the APT portfolio was revoked. So how did you face that situation? And how did you switch to Qualcomm? Okay, so I would say that, during these times of recession, offers being revoked has become a common thing. So it is pretty disheartening because it shouldn't be the case and even more so when it comes to day-one companies. It should really not be the case. But it was in my case and then moving forward in the hardware profile. I would say that if you are not able to land a CDC intern, your first approach should be to apply to fellowship programs that come in. So there are a lot of fellowship programs like DART, DART is for German universities, and then there is MITACS, which is the more mainstream one. Apart from those two, there is EPFL, which is for intern research fellowships in Switzerland. Apart from these three, then there are research programs run by Indian institutes. So those are also good if you can land to professors that do really good work. Apart from that, I also looked at all these things, but in my case, the timing of the rescinding of the offer was pretty terrible. So most of the research fellowship programs were done by then. It was in February, I guess. It was done by then. So I had pretty limited options. In my case, the CDC helped me a lot because they asked me for companies that had come during that time and then they moved forward and approached the companies so that, if they could have any vacancies. They can come back to campus for a hiring spree. So that really helped because Qualcomm came in. I think even AMD came in. And then the process was pretty usual. So once Qualcomm came in then they hired from interviews directly. And I was hired for the interviews. And I was selected. So that was pretty much it. Rescinding an offer is a pretty terrible thing. I do not really wish that somebody goes through it. But that is what you pretty much need to do. If you face it in the future in the hardware profile. Okay, it was quite inspiring. Now moving on to the next question. What were your involvements in KGP? And how did they help you? So my involvements in KGP apart from academics were mostly in Communiqu\u00c3\u00a9 and InterIIT. So I was a governor in my third year at Communiqu\u00c3\u00a9. Apart from that, I was involved in InterIIT, GC, and other stuff. So yeah, that was pretty much my involvement. But in hardware, those hardly come into play. Because the hardware is mostly whatever you have studied and whatever is in your coursework that is being asked, both in tests and interviews. So in the hardware profile, you do not really need any other commitments or involvements apart from your technical knowledge. Moving on to the last question, what advice would you like to give to your juniors sitting for internships this year? So some things I would really like to point out here is that first of all decide your profile early and stick to one decision. And move forward regarding it. Do not keep your legs in both boats. As they say, that would be just sitting on the fence. I would say take one decision, one profile, and move forward with it. And then give your heart and soul to prepare for it like you did for JEE. So most of the people what they do is after like two to three years in KGP, they really can't get back to preparing for internship in such a serious manner I would say, so that is why they falter at getting internships in some cases. Then the other thing I would say is, if you have tried enough at the CDC and you did not get an internship, I don't think it's that big of a deal. So recently I was reading this blog from one of my seniors. He was an IIT KGP alumni about 10 years ago. So one really important thing that he mentioned was that people here override interns and placements. So he talked specifically about placements, but I think interns are even less hyped than placements. He was saying that even if you do not land a placement at KGP, then it's completely fine. If you have the right set of skills, you know how to get work done and you have a good work ethic then you will do something in life. That's way more important than that. Let's say landing a day-one job, most of the people who land day-one, day-two job end up leaving that in let's say a year or two pursuing what they really are interested in. So I would say that the people who do not get internships there would be many of them. But in our case also the internship ratio was I think, less than 50%. So whoever will be registering for CDC, half of them won't be getting internships. So that is something which depends on the market situation and all, so due to that it's not something to feel disheartened about. But yeah, keep working hard and you'll eventually get something in life, that you deserve. So yeah, that would be it. Okay, so Priyanshu. This concludes our session. It was quite an insightful session. Thank you for all your valuable insights. Okay thanks, Aditya. It was my pleasure.

So, Hello Vatsal, how are you? I am doing good. How are you? I'm also fine. So, first of all, congratulations on bagging an internship at Zepto. So, basically in this short interview, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll ask you some questions for our blog series. The blog will be shared with the KGP community to guide them about the selection procedure through your experience. So, if you are ready, can we start? Yeah, thank you very much, Muskan. Let\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s begin. So here goes the first question. So, what was the general interview process for the companies you interviewed? Could you please list down the questions you were asked in the different rounds? The only interviews I gave were for Trexquant and Zepto, both for data science\/analytics roles._x000D_\n_x000D_\nFor Trexquant, there was a preliminary shortlisting round with open internet access, which I personally felt was a great way to gauge one\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s understanding of business analytics. There were only two questions (paraphrased here): \u00e2\u20ac\u0153What according to you are the best indicators to analyse Bank of America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock price. Give as detailed explanations as you can\u00e2\u20ac\u009d and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153How would you use ML approaches along with the aforementioned factors to predict BoA\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d Unlike most shortlisting tests for data science roles, this does correlate with the actual work of the role. I was shortlisted for the interview which was fairly mainstream, dealing with my CV and 2 moderately difficult CP questions. As fate would have it though, I wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t selected for the role._x000D_\n_x000D_\nFor Zepto, there was a shortlisting test with a few MCQ questions on basic ML practices, 1 CP question and 1 SQL question. I was able to solve everything but the SQL question and that got me shortlisted for the interview rounds: one technical and one HR. The technical round focused mainly on my CV and internships, and had fairly straightforward questions. According to me, the HR round was mostly just a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Are you a robot?\u00e2\u20ac\u009d verification round, asking the stereotypical \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Why do you want to join the company\u00e2\u20ac\u009d and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Where do you see yourself in 5 years?\u00e2\u20ac\u009d Thanks for briefing, what are some of the FAQs in most companies that you faced and things students must prepare for? More specifically, in the context of HR rounds?- To prepare for HR rounds, I suggest visiting the company website and reading up on their mission, vision, and other corporate-y stuff they have on there. Additionally (or alternatively), just search YouTube for an interview of someone like the Founder, CEO, etc. talk up the company. This is generally enough content to generate a response which is in line with HR\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s expectations. For technical rounds, try skilling up as much as you can, and once you have a baseline understanding of the field, learn through internships or projects because 1) there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an infinite knowledge pool and not everything is important and 2) visible experience working on a project is greater than the knowledge you claim to have. So, moving ahead, what are the things students sitting for placement next year can do from now until December to maximize their chances of getting through a company in this sector? I cannot recommend \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow: Concepts, Tools, and Techniques to Build Intelligent Systems\u00e2\u20ac\u009d by Aur\u00c3\u00a9lien G\u00c3\u00a9ron enough. It does a great job at explaining basic and advanced ML\/DL concepts along with the ways to code it up. The 1000-or-so pages can be daunting, but as I said before, not everything is important. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d suggest using it as a handbook rather than a textbook. If you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re completely new to ML, start like everyone does, with the Andrew NG courses and the DL specialisation on Coursera. It's not a prerequisite but is definitely a good introduction to the field. The assignments might be a bit dated so don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t hesitate to look up solutions online if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re stuck (I repeat. IF YOU\u00e2\u20ac\u2122RE STUCK). That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s great. My next question is, how did your preparation for technical rounds evolve once you were shortlisted? I personally did not prepare much for CDC at all. I was more interested in getting an FT over CDC, and CP is painstakingly annoying for me so I chose to just give tests with my existing knowledge and see what sticks. However, the most common strategies are to brush up on ML basics before the interviews since related questions are common. Vatsal, anything else that you would want to share with the students? I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll use this question to highlight the importance of keeping calm. Although it sounds like a consolation, CDC is honestly not an accurate measure of worth and is definitely not worth getting worked up or demoralised about. Use the opportunity of having a bunch of companies coming to KGP for the express purpose of recruiting students to the fullest, but don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t forget that it ultimately is just that. An opportunity. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be plenty of other avenues to bag internships before the summer and a rejection from a company does not indicate any lack of skill on your part. Keep your friends and confidants close, and just do the best you can overall. So, Vatsal, your interview is concluded. And thank you for your time. It was great talking to you. Thank you, Muskan.

Hello Abhishek, Good Afternoon; how are you doing today? Hi there Utkarsh! I am doing well, and how about you? I am fine as well. Firstly, my heartiest congratulations to you for bagging an internship at  JPMorgan Chase & Co., an American multinational financial services company which is also the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest bank by market capitalization. _x000D_\nSo, basically, in this short interview, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll ask you a few questions for our quant-oriented blog series. The blog will be shared with the KGP community to guide them about the selection procedure through your experience. So, if you are ready, can we start? Yeah, thanks a lot, Utkarsh. Let\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s begin. What was the general interview process for the companies you interviewed? Could you also mention the number of rounds and the nature of the interview process? So, for the day-1, I got only one shortlist that was also extended in DC Advisory, but that was more finance based, and I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be honest, I do not come from a finance background. They started with brief information about me and talked about my field of interest and some questionnaires related to it. Later, they asked estimation questions and some general thinking questions about the merging of two companies. And then, on Day-2, I got a shortlist in JPMorgan Chase and Co. There was a total of 4 rounds, including technical, statistical, or probability, CV-based (questions were also based on topics from previous rounds), and the last HR round. Also, the length of each round was approximately 45-60 minutes. Could you please list down the questions you were asked in the different rounds? Puzzles, technical questions, and any other discussion, in general, will prove to be helpful for students. i) First Round: This round was based on coding and more technical based problems. It included questions from image preprocessing(since I have done an internship related to this), DSA-based questions (they focus more on optimizing the complexity of a problem) and DP\/recursion-based CP problems._x000D_\n _x000D_\n\tii) Second Round: Questions from probability, expectations and puzzles were asked in this round. These probability questions were directly from Heard on the Street, 50 Challenging Problems, Xingfeng, and BrainStellar (Medium and Hard)._x000D_\n _x000D_\n\tiii) Third Round: Questions were mostly based on my CV. A brief explanation of my past internships and projects. Some questions were based on topics and methods used in those internships and projects. They also asked general questions related to coding and probability._x000D_\n _x000D_\n\tiv) Fourth round (HR): General questions like how was your day and all. They asked why I switched to this field from core and what are my expectations. Also, asked what will be your role as a quantitative researcher at JPMorgan Chase & Co. This information will definitely help our audience in making more informed decisions and prepare themselves accordingly. _x000D_\nWhat are some of the FAQs in most companies that you faced and think students must definitely prepare for? More specifically, in the context of HR rounds. \"Why quantitative research\" and \"What are your expectations from this background\" are some of the most frequently asked questions during the HR round. include generic inquiries about one's strengths and weaknesses. Therefore, you must provide a perfect response here. In addition, it's important to have a fundamental HR round preparation that works for all job profiles and employers._x000D_\nIn response to the previous question, I also discussed my experience. What are things students sitting for placements next year can do from now until December to maximize their chances of getting through a company in this sector? Revise Probability and Statistics. Additionally, there are challenges in books like \"Heard on the Street,\" \"Fifty Challenging Problems in Probability,\" \"Xingfeng,\" and \"brainstellar\" that must be solved. During the interview, you are checked on your approach to a question. Tell them the approach rather than the solution upfront. Try attempting daily coding challenges from 'Interview Bit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 and 'LeetCode'. DSA expertise is always desired. This information will definitely help our audience in making more informed decisions. _x000D_\nHow did your preparation for technical rounds evolve once you were shortlisted? Revised graph, DP, and linked-list related CP problems. I took help from \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Geeks For Geeks\u00e2\u20ac\u009d for my interview preparation. And revised important questions from Heard on the Streets, 50 Challenging Problems. Anything else that you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d want to share with the students? This process can be extremely challenging. To avoid encountering any barriers or problems due to a lack of time, you must remain composed and start planning as soon as possible. You should work out with your friends, communicate frequently, and continue to inspire one another. Start preparing ahead of time because you will have a lot of tests during this period and little time to study.  You should always ask your seniors for assistance. They can be of great assistance because they have been through the procedure and have sat for those companies. Additionally, as interview preparation is usually beneficial, you ought to conduct practice interviews with a few individuals. The secret is to be persistent and patient. Thanks a lot for your suggestions. With this, the interview comes to an end. That's all for the interview. It was great having a talk with you. Your insights and advice will be valuable to the students of IIT Kharagpur. I appreciate it, Utkarsh. It was a delight to participate in this interview. Best Of Luck.

Oh, Hi Rishika. How are you? I'm doing good! So first of all, congratulations for bagging an internship at Bain & Company.  I'd like to ask you what would be the relevant material and resources to understand the concepts of the sector consulting from basics to advanced? Okay. So for Bain, at least for how my interview process went, the resources I have referred to was Victor Cheng\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Case Interview Secrets._x000D_\nThe starting two parts will give you facts about things like fast calculations, estimation techniques, and how to structure your case properly. We had a guesstimate round, so I would suggest going around with guesstimate examples via online resources. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also a playlist, Aditya Agarwal\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Consulting Interview Case Prep, going through the starting 10 videos will give you a better idea on how to go about guesstimates. And if it's for cases, you can just go through the whole playlist, it's a 30-video playlist. Okay. That's great. So next, what was the general interview process of the companies that you interviewed? Can you please mention the number of rounds and the nature of the interview process? So I got into Bain via their True North Scholarship program which is open for women in their pre-final year of undergrad. It was a three-round process. In the first round cumulative, we had to submit our CV and a cover letter in the form of an essay on the concept of True North which was followed by an online assessment curated of aptitude and personality-based questions. Then the shortlisted ones had to face a guesstimate round and after that, the final round was an HR round with a senior. Okay, thank you for the detailed breakdown. So could you please list on some of the questions that you were asked in the different rounds? For example, puzzles, technical questions, or any other discussion in general? Okay. So for the guesstimate round, everyone of us was asked different questions and had like different experiences. For this, the resources mentioned earlier should work and for the final interview round, I was asked a few situation-based questions, like giving an example of a time when you went above and beyond the Call of Duty or mention a time you didn't want to be part of an organization and how did you handle it?_x000D_\nUm, then a few questions were based on why consulting and how it aligns with my interests and future aspirations. So for this round, I would suggest looking at probable questions beforehand and making a doc structuring your answers, think of times when you have created an impact, which is worth mentioning. Okay. So, if someone would like to explore the consulting field through programs or any other initiatives before their internship season, for example, in first or second year, what would you suggest to these people? Firstly, for consult you require a well-tailored CV and they look for spikes in it. So taking up internships, which you think would create an impact or set you apart from other candidates would be a good start, And another section you can highlight could be your POR section, so if you have an opportunity to take up a governing or a head position, then go for it._x000D_\nAlso, get your extracurriculars all juiced up to give an impression that you have a well-rounded CV. And just be good at what you do Okay, that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s great! So, what are your final thoughts that you would want to share with the students sitting for internships this season? What can do from now on to maximize their chances? I would say, create a plan of action. Recognize the areas you are weak in, it could be either guesstimates or cases, or it could be around structuring your thoughts, or it could be your communication skills, and allot your time accordingly. There are numerous resources and a lot to cover, so prioritize your references properly beforehand._x000D_\n_x000D_\nAlso for consult, form a group with your batchmates who are sitting for similar roles, practice guesstimates or cases, and have mock interviews. You can also take suggestions and help from your seniors. Another way to practice would be to look for major business decisions made by companies and try to use your case process to backtrack how they got to the decisions. Finally, keep your calm during the process because it can get awfully overwhelming. Okay, that was insightful! Thank you for your time, Urvi. It was great talking to you.

The blog will be shared with the KGP community to guide them about the selection procedure through your experience. So, if you are ready, can we start? Yeah, thank you very much, Aneesh. Let\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s begin. So here goes the first question. What was the general interview process for the companies you have interviewed? Kindly mention the number of rounds and the nature of the interview process. It starts with a simple CV submission as it is for all the companies at CDC ERP portal. So, basically when you apply for the company, they ask for your CV and along with a CV they also ask for a Google form submission of some questions which helps them to know you as a person; they ask you for a quality check. They ask for anything which can help people know about more about you, what principles you value. They try to judge you using situational type questions. Using the CV and the google form submission, they filter out a chunk of applicants. Speaking in regards to KGP, they select about 50 students for the next round, which is the virtual interview round. In this round, they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll give you a link, wherein you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be asked to answer three questions. You will have about 30-40 secs to read the question and then the audio and video recording starts, where you will be asked to answer. They will be recording your answers and opinions based on the question. These are usually taken to test your industrial knowledge, but not in depth. The third round is the final round, which is a one to one interview which runs around for approximately 20-30 minutes, conducted by industry level professionals from the company on day one. About 20 people are shortlisted for the interview round. Among the 20, 5 were selected this year. Basically, they ask you to introduce yourself and run them through your CV. They look at your internships, projects, previous experiences and if they find something interesting, they will have a small discussion about it. The discussion would be of only 5 minutes, after which they will ask you a few questions regarding it Could you please list down questions you were asked in the different rounds? Puzzles, technical questions, any other discussion in general that you think will prove to be helpful for the students. So, for the virtual interview round, the questions were designed in such a way that they test your industrial knowledge, but at the same time, they weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t too technical or in-depth. For instance, they asked me about the ways in which we can reduce the consumption of plastic in industries. They asked another simple question where there are two lines of production in a factory, namely line A and line B. Line A has a single machine, which produces 10 units per hour and line B produces 6 units per hour, but it has 2 machines. I was asked to list the pros and cons of each of these lines. You can answer these questions as a layman. Line B has 2 machines and Line A has a single machine, so, in case of a fault in a machine, line A will not be functional, whereas line B will have the second machine for production. So this is a pro for line B and a con for line A. Similarly, the power consumed by line A will be less as only a single machine is operated, whereas, the power consumed by line B will be higher because of the usage of two machines. You just have to figure out simple differences and answer them as a layman. In my interview round, seeing that my department is AGFE, they asked me a question on food wastage and the ways to mitigate it. On this, we had a discussion for about 10 minutes. So moving ahead, what are the most frequently asked questions you think the students should prepare for? The questions that I had mentioned above are repeated almost every year. These are some of the standard questions that students must prepare for. This was the funda that was given to us by our seniors, and the same would apply for the students sitting for placements this year. I believe that this would be of great help to the students. What are the things that students sitting for placements next year can do from now until December to maximise their chances of getting through a company in this sector? It is highly recommended that you do an internship or a project or even a case study in this sector. If you have any relatable experiences regarding supply chain, they will go deep into it and ask you questions regarding it. This is what I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve heard from my friends. If you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have anything like that, they will just ask you general questions related to supply chain.  I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have a lot of things related to supply chain in my CV, I had only done a case study conducted by Prakriti, where we had to eliminate the middlemen from the supply chain. I had used blockchain model to tackle the problem. It is important that students learn various techniques and models to counter such problem statements. Supply chain is quite open ended, it must not be mistaken for a core internship. I was actually preparing for consult and solving consult targeted problems and puzzles. This actually helped me structure my thoughts and deliver them in a condensed manner. So, I would recommend that students start solving general puzzles so that they get the idea as to how a problem must be approached and what kind of a solution must be delivered. Being updated with latest tech news and articles in the industry would definitely help in being spontaneous with the solutions. Thanks for the answer. So, moving on to the next question, how did your preparation for interview rounds evolve once you were shortlisted? To be honest, supply chain was never my target. As I said, I was preparing for consult and I was solving more and more case based questions for consult. Before the interview, I went through my case study presentation and that was the extra preparation I did. Along with this, I continued solving more case based questions. I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t prepare anything other than this.  A small section of the consult is actually the FMCG sector. So if you could practice more industry level case based problems that could simply help you in the supply chain role. This is completely from my perspective as this had helped me a lot. I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t do any specific preparation for HUL as I was targeting finance and consult roles. Anything else you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d want to share with the students? For the first year students, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s important for them not to follow the traditional path, rather find their interests by exploring various fields and eliminating the ones that are not suitable to them. I have seen students run behind software development. I also started with it in the beginning, but then I halted in a week or two as I realised that software development was not meant for me. I then moved to data and machine learning, finance and then to consult. I was striking off the things that were not suitable for me and I recommend this for other students as well. I have seen many of my friends who are good coders, struggle to get into software, because of the department and CGPA constraints, missing out on other great opportunities. Hence, it is important to explore every portfolio and find your zone of interest. How much of a role do you think CGPA plays in the selection process? That depends upon the company. Flipkart shortlisted a person having seven CGPA for a product role. It is important not to incorrectly estimate someone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s abilities based on their CG. But, for most of the companies, CGPA does matter. If you are a first year student, it is important to get a good CGPA. Even if some seniors tell you that it doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t matter, the truth is, it does matter. So maintain a good CG throughout your semesters Thanks a lot for your suggestions. With this, the interview comes to an end. Alright Dhawal, it was great talking to you and knowing your experiences and insights. Thank You. It was a pleasure being interviewed.

Hello Agniva, good evening, how are you doing today? Good evening, I am doing fine, how are you? I am doing fine too. First of all, my heartfelt congratulations to you for securing the internship at Adobe. Moving forward, I would like to introduce the general flow of this interview. I will ask you a few questions for our Intern-oriented blog series. This blog will be shared with the KGP community to guide them through the selection procedure based on your experience. So, if you are ready, shall we begin? Yeah, yeah, we can begin. So here is the first question. What was the general interview process for the companies you interviewed? Please mention the number of rounds and the nature of the interview process. See, I was only selected in one software company. I had to interview for only one software company. But I can give you a procedure, I can give you basic information about how it works for the other companies also. So basically, in most companies you have a coding round in which there will be MCQs as well as some coding questions. Mostly there were coding questions only, two to three coding questions and some there were MCQs related to sometimes your development, sometimes maybe there's a data structure, sometimes operating systems and stuff._x000D_\nDepends on the company._x000D_\n So, after the coding round, you were shortlisted on the basis of the performance and after that you had to appear for an interview. So the shortlist came maybe a day before the interview._x000D_\nSo yeah, in the interview you had maybe two to three rounds, in most companies around two rounds, one technical round, one HR round. But in my case, in Adobe, there was only one technical round in case of Adobe product._x000D_\nBut for the product role, in other cases like the MDSR role and the research role, maybe there were two rounds most probably. One was technical and one was HR. And in some cases, in some companies you have two HR rounds even._x000D_\nSo that is the general flow basically. That was very insightful. Moving on to my next question. What are the things students sitting for placements next year can do from now until December to maximize their chances of getting through a company in this sector? So, I can speak mainly mostly in terms of software companies. So, if they have coded before a bit, then they can maybe start competitive programming and continue that for around two to three months to get good at it. Because once you are good at competitive programming and you've got hang of it, you kind of are really good at implementing stuff, which is really important. So, you know, doing competitive programming improves your implementation skills, which is really important. Otherwise, you can start doing Leetcode from now, but that will be an overkill because you need only maybe two or three months to get through the entire lead code question set. So, I'll say if you want to start doing it from now, then start doing CP a bit and then slowly once you have gotten hang of it, you move to Leetcode after that._x000D_\nSo that might be the best thing. You can also take courses like AlgoZenith because I was also enrolled in such a course and it was really helpful for me. So, I can also suggest that. That was very informative to know. Moving on to the next question. How did your preparation for technical rounds evolve once you were shortlisted? Okay, once I was shortlisted, so basically, I'll tell the story in short. My shortlist was just around five or six hours before the interview. So, I did not have much of a time, but I can tell you one thing that mostly you'll know whether you'll have a HR round or not. So, if you have a HR round, the first thing is to see the HR questions, a few basic HR questions that you have on. If you have that on Leetcode, maybe I saw on Leetcode because I was not sure whether HR round would be there or not. But that is, I think the first step because HR round is very important. Once even if you get through the technical round, a lot of people fall up, you know, do not get through because of the HR round because they are not able to answer the questions in the proper way. HR questions are really important._x000D_\nAnd another thing is that you can see the most asked questions of the company, the questions that have been asked mostly. You get that in Geeks for Geeks and all like some specific companies have some specific set of questions that they keep asking. So, there is a high chance of that being repeated. So, you can do that. You can go through those questions. _x000D_\nAlso, if you have anything that is left that you have not covered properly, then it is not at all the time to cover that. If you have very little time left, maybe a few hours, if you have some weak point, it is not the time to panic and start doing that because you will not be able to understand that in the last moment. So those are the few tips to keep in mind after the shortlist comes through. Thank you so much. That was very insightful and very knowledgeable too. Finally, I would like to ask, is there anything else you would like to share with the students? Any tips that you would like to give? Yeah, so mostly I covered that in the previous questions. I covered mostly that. But anything else like this, you start like if you have a few months, maybe five to six months left, they can start understanding things like, they can start focusing on the placement and stuff. Because waiting for the last three months, especially if one doesn't have a software background before, if one has not prepared for SDE role before, if they have not done a lot of data structure algorithms and stuff, then they should start preparing when there is five to six months left. That is a good time to start preparing, you know, you know, so start doing CP and all, you know, start building a project. That is another important thing. If you don't have a project, a project is really important. One project, one to two projects maybe is helpful. _x000D_\nSo yeah, start if you have some specific companies targeted, then see what the companies aim for and start building a project according to that. So, you know, projects are really important. So yeah, that's it. Mostly. Thank you so much. Those words were highly motivating for us and also for the community, student community. Thank you for all the suggestions and the much-needed guidance that you provided. With this, we would conclude the interview. Thanks, Agniva. It was great talking to you and we appreciate the knowledge you shared. Thank you, It was a pleasure being interviewed.
